Each EV saves around 75 tonnes of CO2 per year compared to the diesel buses they replace, and there's also a noticeable increase in air quality. Historically as Norwich doesn't have a Low Emissions Zone a lot of older buses have remained in service here, so its been a big change to no longer cycling behind a giant diesel engine from 2004.\n\n[Electric Vehicles: Zero-emission electric bus - ELECTROLINER (wrightbus.com)](https://wrightbus.com/en-gb/electric-bus-streetdeck-electrolinerBEV)",

      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

      "title": "EV Misconceptions",
      "text": "I've noticed quick a few posts on this page which criticize electric vehicles and Tesla's, specifically. As important as it is that we develop and utilize public transportation, there will inevitably be personal automobiles in use for the foreseeable future to at least some extent, and it's critical that those cars are as least impactful as possible. Electric vehicles aren't a solution to car-centric transportation, however, they are a solution to sustainable personable automobile transportation and are less harmful to the environment and can improve public health.\n\nWhile this sub is about discussing the harmful effects of person automobiles, it's extremely important that we don't spread misconceptions and false information about electric vehicles.\n\nLet's go over a few myths that's I've seen here recently:\n\n**1) Electric vehicles are as bad, or worse, for the environment than gas cars**\n\nThis has been proven false by all studies except for one study conducted in Germany which was later debunked. Even in areas where EVs are charged with fossil fuel generated electricity, the emissions are still lower due to the high efficiency of the power plant compared to a gas car, as well as the regenerative breaking of the EV. The manufacturing emissions of the battery are high but the break-even point occurs within only a few years of ownership. [Here is a study specific to Canada](https://www.2degreesinstitute.org/reports/comparing_ghg_emissions_of_bevs_and_icevs.pdf)\n\n**2) Electric vehicles are more dangerous**\n\nDue to the rigidity and weight of the battery, as well as the large crumple zone in most EVs as a result of a small motor in the front (or no motor), EVs are inherently safer. They are more resistant to rolling and perform better in side impact and head on collisions. The car with the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle tested is the [Tesla Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa).\n\n**3) The batteries are unstable and can catch fire**\n\nAccording to the NTSTA \"that the propensity and severity of fires and explosions from the accidental ignition of flammable electrolytic solvents used in Li-ion battery systems are anticipated to be somewhat comparable to or perhaps slightly less than those for gasoline or diesel vehicular fuels.\" According to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/vehiclesafetyreport#:~:text=this%20time%20period.-,2020,every%2019%20million%20miles%20traveled), their vehicles experience a fire at a rate of 1/10th that of a gas car.\n\n**4) The batteries need to be replaced in only a few years**\n\nMost vehicle battery warranties are about 6 to 8 years, however, this does not indicate the batty lifespan. There are many EV batteries that still have plenty of capacity after a half million kilometers. [Tesla batteries have an average retention of 90% after 320 000km.](https://insideevs.com/news/525820/tesla-battery-capacity-retention-90/)\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to comment.",

We had:\n\n- The main, nicer, family commuter SUV\n- My work commuter 90s sedan\n- Motorcycle \n- A project van that doubled as a shed on wheels\n- A project car with electrical issues I bought on a steal.\n\nWife lost her job due to covid and I realized all this was ridiculous and took some steps.\n\nFirst I fixed and sold the project car, but that was always it's fate. \nSecond I sold the van to a European couple who wanted to live in it while traveling East back home. \nSold the motorcycle, was hard to let go. \nDonated my 90s sedan to my friend, who was using an old work truck that had half the things wrong in it and wasn't starting in the cold. \n\nUsing the money raised by selling all that, I bought a accident history PHEV for pretty cheap to replace both commuters. My work at the time had me drive 220km daily, so the milage reimbursement equaled the car's worth in 6 months. \n\nFinally I sold the SUV back to the dealership for $4k more than I owed. This was in the middle of the chip shortage and gas price peak, and it was a PHEV SUV, so the demand was extreme. Little too late though, as they're still sitting on it 10 months later. Good luck with that.\n\nResults: it's been tough adapting. I've gotten pretty good at condensing errands and trips. With no car payments I was able to qualify for a mortgage which is just huge for us. Wife wants to find a job again which hints at finding a second car, so I'm going to attempt to see how viable a 1hr commute on an ebike will be. Public transit here is atrocious, costing ~$90/mo and the travel time is slower than biking. \n\nBut I feel like I did a good job eliminating and upcycling. The van is 100% in a Nova Scotian junkyard by now, but I see my old car a couple times a month so that's cool.",

I live in Tucson, AZ, about as close to work as I can afford without living somewhere with constant break ins, which comes out to 16 miles away. \n\nI would love to live somewhere walkable and all that, like is shown in videos on here or whatever all the time, but I can\u0019t help but wondering where the tens of trillions of dollars it would take to redo our infrastructure to achieve this comes from because you guys do know that it wouldn\u0019t be a snap your fingers thing, right?! I know, \u001csunk cost fallacy,\u001d but do you really think there isn\u0019t a possibility that change isn\u0019t possible without substantially lowering quality of life for probably the poorest people mostly?

Like yeah, if we could all afford to live in these SoDoSoPa developments we probably would, but they are all expensive to live in and out of reach of workers. \n\nAll these houses in suburbs exist, in order to replace them you\u0019d have to build an unfathomable amount of buildings, there isn\u0019t room for everyone to just move out of them. \n\nI guess I just see people talking about the end goal without thinking about the in between and if that in between is even possible.",

      "text": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/americas-favorite-pickup-truck-goes-electric\n\n\"Then there\u0019s the other big issue with pickups, whether they\u0019re gas-powered or E.V.s: their size. Since 1990, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the weight of the average pickup has increased by twelve hundred and fifty-six pounds\u0014thirty-two per cent. A recent post on Vice observed that the largest pickups and S.U.V.s today are as big as Second World War-era tanks. Now pickups are going to get heavier still. The Lightning, because of its lithium-ion battery, weighs approximately sixty-five hundred pounds; in some cases the pickup can be more than two thousand pounds heavier than its gas counterpart. You\u0019ll be capable of assaulting a mountaintop redoubt, even if you\u0019re just driving to the store for milk.\n\nNot only are large E.V.s not as green as smaller E.V.s.; what about all the people who aren\u0019t in big vehicles? Analysis from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has shown that pedestrians who are hit by pickups or S.U.V.s are two to three times more likely to die than those who are hit by cars. In fact, the number of pedestrians killed by vehicles rose forty-six per cent between 2010 and 2019. According to the Governors Highway Safety Association, if you count deaths against vehicle miles travelled, 2020 saw the largest increase in pedestrian fatalities (twenty-one per cent) since nationwide tracking started, in 1975. Even though fewer vehicles were on the road early in the pandemic, more people died.\"\n\nIn my opinion electrifying is not the solution.\n\nLet's have a meaningful discussion about this.",

      "text": "I recently rented a car (had to go to a wedding on an evening, no usable public transit to get there, unless I changed trains 4 times, for a hundred km - not worth it)\n\nIt was on a Saturday evening, so I could only bring the car back on the Monday morning. Gave me a whole day to use it, and therefore to charge it, so I chose an electric car. I\u0019ll come back to it in a moment.\n\nHaving full access to a car, on-demand, made me understand why carbrains say cars are freedom. Because it does feel like that.\nOf course I am but too aware of the issues and costs of a car, so I could tamper the feeling. But anyone in car culture will not. They will only feel that \"freedom\" which comes with their car.\n\nNote that one could feel similar with a bike, but my experience here got exacerbated by how I didn\u0019t have access to a bike at the moment (on vacation).\n\nAs for the electric car - compared to a gas car. Super fun to drive, ngl. On sunday, while I was looking for a charger, I tried the acceleration on an empty parking lot. Blissful and exhilarating experience. Such a pain in the ass to charge though.\n\nI had a small car (Peugeot e208), 50kWh battery. Fully charging it on the wall outlet would have taken 50h, so I went to find a charger. What a nightmare. Not only is it not that much cheaper than gas for a fuel-efficient vehicle, but you must give up your privacy to charge your car. It\u0019s not like the gas pump, you have to use a website to pay, and enter your email address, when it doesn\u0019t force you to create an account and store your credit card info on their server.\n\nIn the end, 5/10. If I don\u0019t have to deal with the charge, I\u0019ll happily rent an electric car again (if I need a car ofc).\n\nIf I ever get a car, it will be a station wagon or minivan, when I\u0019ll have at least 4 children (or maybe 3, trains don\u0019t usually have 5/6-seat spaces), and it will be a diesel, only used to carry the family across the country on vacation, or to bring absurd amounts of shit to the recycling plant.",

      "text": "I've made it to almost 40 without ever needing or wanting a car. I've worked from home for years, and I've always met my needs by walking, cycling and using public transport. My city was far from the best for car-free living, but I've made it work.\n\nThis year we moved to the suburbs. In some respects it's great: much cheaper property prices, there's a bike path network which runs out into the surrounding countryside with lochs and fields and forests. But practically, day-to-day transport is a nightmare. Instead of everything being conveniently located on mixed-use streets, shops and gyms tend to be scattered on business \"parks\" at the edge of town. I've had some near misses with idiot drivers, and I don't feel safe at all with my kids riding on the road.\n\nThen there's the coronavirus situation. I have drastically cut my public transport use in recent years, but when I've taken a train or a bus I've been shocked at the number of people not wearing masks. Like, 70% of passengers. Sometimes I feel close to a panic attack.\n\nSo I find myself actually contemplating doing what I thought I'd never do, getting my driving licence and buying a car. It seems crazy: at least £9,000 for a used electric vehicle, £750 a year for insurance and completely rearranging a lifestyle that has worked for me my whole life. But I'm having trouble seeing any other way.",

      "text": "As a non-American I'm shocked by the fact you can't get to literally any place in the country by train. My city is literally based around public transport and despite the fact the car road system is decent as well and both of them being constantly upgraded, owning a car here is controversial at best and unreasonable at worst.\n\nIn my city of Moscow I can get literally anywhere on the map in 30 min from the center within city limits (and Moscow ain't a small city), 50-60 within close to mid suburban. It takes around 50 minutes to get from the northern border to the southern and vice versa. 85% of city limits are reachable by metro + 5-15 min walk, for further places busses course regularly (mostly EV ones). Also there are plenty of alternative public transportation as well like trams, trolleys, suburban trains (my personal favorite), monorail, a few cable car routes and recently even river trams were proposed. And for those rare occasions where you absolutely need a personal car there's a very extensive car sharing service starting from 12 RUB/min (about 19 cents). \n\nTaxis are also very numerous and cheap, a ride on a Polo/Rio/Solaris class across the city border to border will cost you about 600-800 rub (10-15 bucks) depending on current demand. Better vehicles like Passat/Optima/Sonata will be around 20 bucks, and for 50+ you'll ride the s-class like a chad. A single universal ticket for metro/buss/train/tram costs 55 rub (about 85 cents), a card for a week or more will be like twice as cheap per ride. This is much much more economic than having your own car, especially when you take parking prices, gas etc. into the account. \n\nI'm 22 y. o. and I can't even imagine myself owning a car without a solid reason like having 3+ kids or a personal business or a job somewhere unreachable by other transport and even then 2/3 cases an alternative like a car sharing or taxi would be better and cheaper in long term. \n\nThe point is when the city has a proper public transportation system, cars become obsolete and irrelevant, and because of that mayor administration plans to close the city center for cars entirely by 2030 and even now about 30-40% of streets are pedestrian only and parking prices within the historical center are outrageous. \n\nMy hot take is that cars should be regulated like guns are (edit: like in EU or here in Russia), so in order to get one you'd have to go through multiple examinations, mandatory extreme driving classes for better driving skills in extreme situations, get a special permission from the city, and of course be taxed minimum twice the value as well as spare parts for them. Gas should be taxed even more, minimum 80% of its price being excise price tax, like cigarettes and booze. The state should discourage new car purchases by all means necessary, personal transport in a modern city is simply an unnecessary luxury and should be treated as such.\n\nEVs and hybrids are just as bad unless you're planning to use them for 10+ years and don't change your battery even once, because otherwise you're not only not reducing emissions and pollution but increasing it, it's just being released elsewhere. Don't fool yourself.",

      "title": "\"When cars won against pedestrians\" \"In the United States it happened more or less a century ago, thanks to a new word that turned the situation around\"; [in depth article in italian, translated with DeepL]",
      "text": "[https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/12/jaywalking-auto-pedoni/](https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/12/jaywalking-auto-pedoni/)\n\nThe article tells also about the origin of the word \"jaywalking\" and how it was used by the car industry to shift the responsibility against pedestrians. In the final part talks about what happened in Italy.\n\nA century ago, in the early twenties, cars were a novelty. In Italy, where they circulated in the tens of thousands, they were almost a rarity. But even in the United States, where they had begun to spread much earlier and had done so much more quickly, they arrived quite suddenly and spread and imposed themselves on roads that until a few years before were traveled by pedestrians, horses, wagons or carriages. So much so that in the early twenties in the United States, they caused serious problems and thousands of deaths per year. Especially among pedestrians, especially children, accustomed to move freely in the street, in contexts where cars did not exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a time, about a century ago, when in the United States the protests against cars and their intrusion into the streets that until then belonged to others were many and intense. But the automotive industry reacted and managed - in a very short time and with great effectiveness - to turn the situation around. The idea that roads should be cars and that pedestrians should be considered guilty if they were hit became common sense. It all had a lot to do with an aggressive and highly effective campaign tied to a simple word: jaywalking, still used in the United States today to define the act of recklessly crossing the street where it's not allowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main research on how and when the concept of jaywalking was introduced, and how relevant it was in reversing an increasingly negative perception of cars, has been done by the American Peter D. Norton, historian and author of the book Fighting Traffic. Interviewed a few years ago by Vox, Norton said, \"In the early days of automobiles, it was up to drivers to avoid pedestrians, not the other way around,\" and speaking with Bloomberg he added, \"If we ask today whose roads are whose, we hear the answer that they are cars, it's just the opposite of what we would have been told a hundred years ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New York City street in the 1920s (Keystone/Getty Images)   \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili19.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili19.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Crosswalks,\" albeit without parallel white stripes, are about as old as pedestrians, and have been around since well before cars. They're one of those things of which it can be said that, albeit in their own way, \"they were already there in Pompeii.\" Certainly, however, in the United States in the early 1900s, the streets belonged to pedestrians more than anyone else. Horses were anything but a novelty, rail vehicles were predictable in their progress, and cars were rare, expensive, noisy, and rather slow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings changed when Henry Ford's Model T, a car designed to be mass-produced and capable of reaching a top speed of about 70 kilometers per hour, became popular. In the years after the First World War and even more so in the first half of the \"roaring\" Twenties, more and more Americans found themselves behind the wheel of heavy and fast cars, without the roads, the rules and what today we would call \"other road users\" having had time and opportunity to adapt to this bursting novelty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New York street in 1923 (AP Photo)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP2301010217-2048x1414.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP2301010217-2048x1414.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1924 the Ford Motor Company's dealers were about ten thousand, and in that period - in which the United States had more or less 115 million people living - the country exceeded the significant threshold of one car for every 10 inhabitants. Motels (short for \"motor-hotel\"), drive-ins and a host of other car-related activities and pastimes were born. But there were also intense protests from those who, more than anything else, found themselves subjected to cars. Especially in urban areas, in fact, cars became one of the main causes of death: in the twenties, only in the United States, they caused the death of about 200 thousand people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCars were therefore seen as a serious threat. Cartoons and comics depicted drivers as \"Death\", complete with scythe. There were those who spoke of a \"terrible massacre that must be stopped\", and there were those who lobbied for cars to be fitted with speed limiters, a bit like what happens today with electric scooters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn November 1924, a full-page headline in the New York Times spoke of the United States as a country \"in revolt against motor homicide.\"  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JW2.jpeg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JW2.jpeg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe article began thus:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The horrors of war turn out to be less terrifying than those of peace. Cars stand out as far more lethal mechanisms than machine guns. The reckless driver claims more lives than the gunner. Those in the streets are less safe than those in the trenches. Fifteen thousand of our men were killed in the nineteen months of our participation in the World War. Two thousand deaths a month, a modest number when compared with the staggering toll of seven thousand lives ended each month by accidents in the United States. The automobile is the largest single cause of death.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it contained this simple chart:\n\n(New York Times)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyt-copia.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyt-copia.jpg)\n\nAs recalled in a recent article written by Clive Thompson on Medium, in 1922 in New York City a demonstration for road safety was organized: among others, about 10,000 children had marched and 1,054 of them were made to walk apart, to represent the deaths caused the previous year by cars in New York.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThompson also cites a figure that in 1924, there were 12 percent fewer cars sold in the United States than the previous year. The automotive industry realized that the situation was serious and threatened to become very serious. First of all, it tried to promote courses and awareness campaigns for young people, for example by going to schools to remind them to pay attention to traffic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbove all, however, the automotive industry began to talk about jay walking. The word, now in common use in U.S. English, combined the word \"walking\" with \"jay\", a term used at the beginning of the 20th century to denote, in a derogatory manner, someone not very bright from the countryside, a \"yokel\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not clear how and when the word was born - on whose origin there are also a couple of other theories with much less supporters - but it seems that at the beginning it was used, apart from car-related contexts, to talk about someone who came from outside to the city, wandering awkwardly and without knowing what to do or where to go. Thanks to an intense campaign, in which newspapers filled with car advertisements played a relevant role, the word began to be used to refer to pedestrians who crossed the street carelessly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, those who drove - and could afford a car - were the future and were in the right. Those who remained pedestrians, and couldn't even figure out when and how to let cars pass, were the past, were cut off. Rather than a campaign of empowerment, it was in some ways a very effective victim blaming effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(National SafetyCouncil)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jw4.png](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jw4.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were those who tried to react, among other things trying to talk about jay driving, but jay walking had much better luck, moreover becoming a single word: jaywalking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this regard, Norton describes an event organized in the twenties in New York in which a clown who does not know how to cross a street is repeatedly hit, at very low speed, by a Model T, for which - watching the scene - you end up obviously taking sides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second half of the Twenties, car sales started to rise again: road deaths and massacres in the United States were less and less talked about, with different tones and less frequency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew York City in 1933 (Jack Maytig/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili13.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili13.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, there were only one car per 500 inhabitants in Italy: very few, even compared to countries like France, Germany and the United Kingdom. There was one car for every ten inhabitants only in 1965, forty years later than in the United States. What Model Ts had done there, FIAT's 600s and 500s did here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatteo Dondè - an architect and urban planner who is an expert in issues concerning bicycle mobility and traffic calming - explains that, in effect, what happened in the United States after World War I, happened in Italy after World War II. But in a different way, because the period and the context were different. According to him, for Italy, \"the theme of squares was representative, public places par excellence that, from one moment to the next, became spaces to be dedicated to cars\". It happened in Piazza Duomo in Milan, Piazza del Campo in Siena and even in Rome around the Colosseum, \"without even the car manufacturers having to commit themselves as they had done in America\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, continues Dondè, everything happened almost naturally, because - even without the active influence of the \"communicating force\" of the powerful and influential car manufacturers - in Italy \"the country of small towns, the car was even more of an element of freedom than elsewhere\". A certain victimization of pedestrians was therefore a consequence of the spread of cars, rather than something planned from above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere isn't, in Italian, a single word to translate the concept of jaywalking, but according to Dondè the thought at the base of the concept is well present. For example, it can be found in the meaning of the word \"accident\", or in the perception of many road deaths as a \"fatality\", or even in expressions such as \"overturning car\", \"hit-and-run driver\". Or again, in the references, even recent and institutional ones, to pedestrians as subjects that \"must be educated\" and that, in any case, must remain subordinate to cars.  \n[https://twitter.com/Nigel\\_\\_DSouza/status/1482685066132160512](https://twitter.com/Nigel__DSouza/status/1482685066132160512)\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)\n\nI hope that it was an interesting read for you and that you learned many new things about roads and cars.

An electric scooter crossed the Cours de Verdun and collided with a Bordeaux city vehicle in which Pierre Hurmic, the city's mayor, was travelling. The scooter's driver believes it was a hit-and-run accident. The municipal opposition denounced the mayor's attitude. The girl, a 22-year-old student, suffers from whiplash. She claims to have been dissuaded from lodging a complaint twice at the police station.\n\nShe has filed a complaint with the public prosecutor for unintentional injury and hit-and-run. A version of events disputed by the mayor of Bordeaux. \"The driver rolled down the window, spoke to the passenger on the electric scooter that had just hit our vehicle, asked about her, and she said 'It's okay'. He suggested stopping further on to draw up an amicable report, but the person declined and continued on her way\", confides Pierre Hurmic. The judicial investigation has only just begun.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMan, you're a green mayor, just stop using a car, and apologize.\n\n[https://www.francetvinfo.fr/france/nouvelle-aquitaine/gironde/bordeaux/bordeaux-le-maire-refute-le-delit-de-fuite-a-la-suite-d-un-accident-entre-une-trottinette-et-sa-voiture\\_6119508.html](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/france/nouvelle-aquitaine/gironde/bordeaux/bordeaux-le-maire-refute-le-delit-de-fuite-a-la-suite-d-un-accident-entre-une-trottinette-et-sa-voiture_6119508.html)",

      "text": "It concerns me how much reporting electric cars get in the news where I live compared to news relating to public transit, infrastructure for cyclists/pedestrians etc. For context, I live in a smaller Australian state (about 100,000 people in my city and 500,000 in the state, the only transit we have is busses). \n\nThe crux of the story is always something like \"electric vehicle sales at record high\" or \"new electric charging ports installed in city centre\" and there'll be some person employed in the business talking about the positives of switching from gas to electric, and how the change is \"inevitable\" or \"a step forward\".\n\nI think most here would agree that regardless of what benefits electric cars may have over gas cars, getting more people to walk, bike or use transit in their commutes is far more beneficial for our urban areas and what we should be focused on improving. \n\nWith the regular stories essentially promoting the switch to electric, it scares me that many will believe it's the solution to the problems associated with their car without considering either using or pushing for the improvement of far more beneficial modes of transport. The thinking will be \"Well if it's electric that means it's green and I can keep my commute the same whilst helping the environment.\".\n\nThis isn't to put the blame on individuals, it just frustrates me the message that is being sent with this reporting. I'm not sure what it's like in other countries, though given Australia has a pretty big car culture as America does I'd imagine the reporting is similar in the US (let me know if so).",

You can sue for lost wages, but that's only valid if the other driver was found to be negligent, which is rarely found to be the case. \n\nSo when your family member is killed by a car, there is no accounting for the negative externality that is not having that person in your life anymore. I think insurance should have to pay out for lifetime lost wages using a similar calculation that the 9/11 victims used. They averaged about $2 million, which seems like reasonable compensation to the families that lost a loved one.\n\nThis would help more accurately account for the cost we pay to keep our car dependent system. It would also dramatically change insurance rates for large vehicles that are more likely to kill people, like the electric hummer. Right now that risk you impose on others is free to you.",

      "title": "Cars and Light Pollution?",
      "text": "One of the most under reported forms of pollution has to be light pollution due to several factors. In a vacuum, how is artificial light a problem to humans? Artificial lights don't directly poison the air, gives us comfort and sense of security at night, and help us to see where we're going. What light pollution?\n\nWell, light pollution *does* negatively affect the natural world as bright lights can make prey visible at night, mess up an animals natural nighttime navigation, can confuse birds, etc. Light pollutions can negatively impact humans as well as it may make it harder to sleep at night if they're a bright light that can cause other factors. I won't go into too much detail here as I'm not the most informed on this subject but feel free to read the articles down below.\n\n[https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/causes/](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/causes/)\n\n[https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/human-health/](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/human-health/)\n\n[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13157](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13157)\n\nRather, what I would like to share with you is what *I* believe to be the largest contributor both directly and indirectly to light pollution. And that is, of course, cars!\n\nThink about it! Starting with streetlights, why are they so large and bright? Is it for human navigation and security at nighttime? Well, prior to cars, initial kerosene lamps were rather dim, but they were more than sufficient for human navigation at night.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yyp49qa7lqd1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb47639afb7bbb303ef9d4398bd75d7b7452eb99\n\nAs for why modern electric street lamps are so bright? I don't think it's because it was to deter crime, as the concept of \"Eyes on the Street\" would be better than that as in pedestrianized areas, the lights can be rather dim and are nowhere near as bright as the ones for cars.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vti3o4b97lqd1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7d1dee6762dd17c0e5c20f5da0ac4c830c5dd0a\n\nRather, I firmly believe that the widespread adoption of cars lead to street lamps needing to be brighter to allow for \"safer\" driving at night. And hence, creating an endless cycle of brighter and brighter lights.\n\nNow, while streetlights are prominent in cities and urban areas, many roads, in fact most roads don't have streetlights, meaning that cars have to rely on their *own* headlights to see at night. And I shouldn't have to tell you [how bright modern cars' headlights are](https://globalnews.ca/news/10417509/car-headlight-brightness/) and the various problems that causes. You could say that modern streetlights and headlights are [Blinding Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRXx6U8ABQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4iv8jj0elqd1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b1d7db310d240a06752faadfa98be7b1b6604a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw75gmpzbmqd1.jpg?width=2176&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9316c7ce713352e43c4731ccda6505bc7b3db62c\n\nWith that being said, let me compare what *I* have observed between the headlights of cars, versus those of trains. These are just my personal experiences, but feel free to share your own.\n\nNow, the main metro system that I use nearly everyday and is the most familiar with is the Vancouver SkyTrain in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nWith the newer Mark III Rolling Stock, they feature fancy and new LED headlights. From the outside, they can be spotted rather easily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2e9dsjeflqd1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4da66f82957fd4f9e3a8ea626cecc5f26d11fe5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o9mmtyeflqd1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424f98f8c19a00fac3e62b67953c54e579217f41\n\nBut rest assure, because the SkyTrain is a fully automatic system with no driver onboard, when under automatic operations, when you look out of windshield during nighttime, you can't see sh\\*t.\n\nLike for real, you can barely see the track in front of you while riding a Mark III at night. The older Mark I's and Mark II's have brighter, yellow headlights.\n\nBecause the SkyTrain is fully automatic, there's no need for bright streetlights and headlights, and especially with the Mark III's, during normal automatic operations, only the \"daytime running lights\" are on (the Mark III's have real, regular headlights above the daytime running lights), meaning that most of the route is in the dark.\n\nEven on freight trains that *do* require more visual signaling, their headlights don't seem to be as blinding as a modern car, and there's no need for light poles along the route. And of course with in-cab signaling, there's no need for visual signaling lights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01sfumjwolqd1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1104d62c4438cf7943b941c3cd9c7f82c0f832\n\nAs such, I firmly believe that trains in general, both regular freight trains and fully automatic metro systems produce rather little light pollution compared to road vehicles. And that most of our modern light pollution can somewhat be correlated to cars as while cars aren't the only cause, I *do* believe they're one of the biggest.",

      "text": "Whilst I don't agree with the entire premise of fuck cars as I live in a very secluded area with no bus routes or train lines within 10 miles of my home I am very much against certain vehicles.\n\nWhy do SUVs exist? Many people argue its due to needing extra space in a car, which I think is absolute rubbish not one person needs a boot (trunk) with more capacity than a freight ship its a terrible excuse as you practivally move a whole house with an SUV boot, SUVs are the most inefficient vehicles on the road with a little 2.5 litre engine trying to pull a monster 2 ton vehicles, just to get an average of 20mpg whilst emissions may be low the waste in fuel (electric or petrol) its astronomically high. Put the same engine in a smaller car and you will see the engine get 40+mpg The only use I can think for SUVs is if you live on a farm but even then you don't want an SUV you want an offroad vehicle. \n\nAnother major issue with these vehicles is that many people do not know how to drive such a goliath vehicle and they are most definitely the most dangerous and erratic drivers on the road as they believe that because they have a big car they own the road, which simply is not true and makes a safe drive feel a lot more dangerous. I definitely think there should be separate licences for driving a bigger car because some people driving these giant vehicles are a danger to the roads.",

      "title": "Causes of America's Car Culture and Urban Sprawl - and Its Undoing",
      "text": "This post will attempt to create a comprehensive list of why America's built environment and transportation system is the way it is. I will also explain why some of these things are undoing themselves.\n\n1. Frontier Culture combined with cheap and abundant habitable land - From the beginning of US history there was a desire to move west and find land to settle. One of America's grievances in the revolutionary war was not being able to settle past a certain line the British drew. Once we became independent we had the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican American war and the acquisition of the Pacific northwest. The Transcontinental railroad itself was a vehicle to encourage westward settlement. Pretty much every advance in transportation - the Steamboat, steam railways, the horse drawn streetcar, the electric streetcar, the interurban railway, elevated railways, subways and or course cars all had the effect of encouraging decentralization.  Very few American cities are built around walking, horses and buggies, and water transport the way European Cities were. Asian Countries have had extremely large populations combined with smaller amounts of desirable and habitable land. With recent waves of immigration though populations have tended to concentrate themselves in certain regions. immigration has caused the population of places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Miami and other places to explode. Plus there is the controversial trend of gentrification. See here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u0p770/most\\_of\\_america\\_lives\\_on\\_a\\_small\\_portion\\_of\\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u0p770/most_of_america_lives_on_a_small_portion_of_its/)\n2. Cheap and abundant energy supplies - Cheaper gas prices and electricity prices help to drive urban sprawl ([https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/whats-driving-remarkable-decline-urban-sprawl-in-us/](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/whats-driving-remarkable-decline-urban-sprawl-in-us/)). Urban sprawl requires higher electricity consumption and longer electrical lines ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617318280](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617318280)), which results in greater transmission losses. The United States used to have lots of cheap and abundant conventional oil. Oil was cheaper than water in Texas at one point. Today most oil in North America is expensive unconventional oil, thus to meet demand we have to import it or pay much more for it.  Car culture depends upon cheap gasoline or other forms of fuel for cars. Every time there is a substantial increase in oil or gas prices, sprawl goes down. The current (as of the writing of this post) increase in gas prices might go away after a time, but it is part of a longer term trend. Oil discoveries have been declining ([https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oil-natural-gas-discoveries-worldwide-decline-to-lowest-level-in-75-years/](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oil-natural-gas-discoveries-worldwide-decline-to-lowest-level-in-75-years/)). Oil discoveries peaked around the 1960s. The shale boom which made more recent cheaper oil prices possible is coming to an end and was likely never profitable to begin with ([https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/02/oil-frackers-brace-for-end-of-the-u-s-shale-boom-wsj/](https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/02/oil-frackers-brace-for-end-of-the-u-s-shale-boom-wsj/)). Conventional oil peaked around the mid 2000s and hence why we have seen a boom in fracking, tar sands, and offshore drilling, these are only viable with high prices ([https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/conventional-oil-peaked-in-2008-iea-2013-01-18/rep\\_id:4136](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/conventional-oil-peaked-in-2008-iea-2013-01-18/rep_id:4136)). I would recommend looking up James Howard Kunstler, he is controversial and I myself disagree with him that we lack capital for building rail, but he is undeniably correct about the future of oil. Both people who accept climate change and those who deny it assume upon infinite supplies of abundant hydrocarbons, when empirical evidence is contrary to this. Climate change, while definitely a problem, has served to drown out the reality of peak oil. It's not peak oil, gas and coal will also decline too. Any realistic climate change policy needs to include a decrease in the amount of cars, airplanes and trucking for transportation, per capita energy use and consumption. \n3. Cultural bias against cities and towns - American culture and other Anglo saxon outposts have had a cultural bias against cities and town and always idealized country living. Suburbs were seen as a means of combining the two. Car oriented suburbs effectively combine the two, while making both worse in the process. Aside from culture, some cities were beginning to have quality of life issues, such as New York with its tenement buildings. interestingly there is now a roughly even split in the desire for walkability vs more space among the US public ([https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/06/13/pew-survey-liberals-want-walkability-conservatives-want-a-big-lawn/](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/06/13/pew-survey-liberals-want-walkability-conservatives-want-a-big-lawn/)).\n4. Individualism - this should go without saying , but Americans and other Anglo-Saxon countries are hyper-individualist and hate anything that involves contact with other people or sharing with other people. Cars and sprawl embody this to the maximum degree possible and is one reason why people often do not even know their neighbors. \n5. White flight/redlining/urban renewal - I think this point is overemphasized - but white flight and racism, were and to some extent still are factors. Gentrification is reversing this to some extent. To what extent white flight was caused by irrational prejudice towards blacks and to what extent it was caused by legitimate concerns about crime and quality of life (see Detroit riots) is hard to quantify. On the one hand white flight caused urban areas to be gutted, but many cities had riots and people were concerned about their safety. interestingly the policy of \"forced busing\" where the Federal Government attempted to forcibly integrate schools via busing black children to white schools was only done in urban schools, but not suburban ones according \"Crabgrass Frontier\".  There was also public housing and urban renewal that caused urban areas to decline in quality and poverty to be concentrated. Many beautiful buildings were torn down to make way for uglier modern ones (a video on urban renewal: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PydFzWfkdOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PydFzWfkdOw)). I address this here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u8z9d3/my\\_thoughts\\_on\\_white\\_flight\\_suburbia\\_and\\_racism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u8z9d3/my_thoughts_on_white_flight_suburbia_and_racism/)\n6. Ultra high living standards - The period from the 1920s - 1970s, with the exception of the depression and WW2, was basically the most prosperous generation of people in human history and unlikely to be repeated. Resource limits will prevent any nation from ever having that level of wealth, as everyone having American living standards would require several additional planets ([https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/#:\\~:text=Here's%20how%20we%20calculate%20that,if%20everyone%20lived%20like%20Americans](https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/#:~:text=Here's%20how%20we%20calculate%20that,if%20everyone%20lived%20like%20Americans).). In the 1950s we had 35% of workers unionized ([https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22union.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22union.html)), 50% of the world's manufacturing vs today where it is being outsourced ([https://60dayusa.com/posts/what-happened-to-the-u-s-manufacturing-industry/](https://60dayusa.com/posts/what-happened-to-the-u-s-manufacturing-industry/)), and real wages peaked in the 1970s ([https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)), coincidentally the time when the oil crisis happened and cars were least fuel efficient. Single family home ownership and sprawl correlates with incomes too, and unionized workers are more likely to own homes \"In 2006, about two-thirds of American families own their dwellings, a proportion which rises to three-fourths of AFLCIO union members\".  Car ownership corresponds with higher incomes ([https://www.sightline.org/2011/11/28/more-money-more-cars/](https://www.sightline.org/2011/11/28/more-money-more-cars/)) ([https://voxeu.org/article/new-measure-global-middle-class](https://voxeu.org/article/new-measure-global-middle-class)), and several have pointed to low Indian car ownership, but this is in a part a result of their low standards of living. Unfortunately the trend is towards lower incomes and people are struggling. Roughly 50 percent of Americans make 30,000 or less ([https://www.business2community.com/us-news/half-of-americans-make-less-than-30000-per-year-01369249](https://www.business2community.com/us-news/half-of-americans-make-less-than-30000-per-year-01369249)).",

      "text": "I was initially going to parody the post by someone with a post of the same name, but then I decided to actually be constructive and propose some reasonable, non-preachy answers to the guy\u0019s excuses.\n\nTo preface though, any actions one takes alone will mean nothing without collective action, especially with those outside this subreddit and are at best lukewarm to a future not dominated by cars. \n\n\"My emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d\n\nThis is true, but that doesn\u0019t reduce our personal responsibility. This mindset is a killer of positive change in many areas, voting and littering as examples. We can\u0019t stop the bad individually, but we can reduce the harm.\n\nMake sure to stay involved in all levels of government though. If there\u0019s something local to you pumping out emissions, chances are they have to deal with some level of your local government, and you can influence that too, especially if you\u0019re part of a group.\n\n\"I can't afford an electric car.\"\n\nHave you looked into federal subsidies? They can help bring the price down as a customer.\n\nThere are other options though. Hybrids are a decent middle ground, plenty of used ones out there at this point. Try to use the battery as often as you can. \n\n\"I don't have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\"\n\nHave you sat down and tried to plot out a public transit or bike route to/from work? It could be better than you think.\n\nIf public transit is prohibitive due to infrequent appearances or prohibitive travel times, try car pooling with co-workers. It\u0019s still a car on the road, but in total it\u0019s at least one less car that needs to go to/from your work place.\n\n\"Driving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\"\n\nHow significant is the time? If it\u0019s less than 15 more minutes each way, is it really that much better? \n\nIf it\u0019s an hour\u0019s difference or you need to get to another job soon after, then that\u0019s a pass.\n\n\"There's no infrastructure to bike where I live.\"\n\nThat can\u0019t be helped in the moment. High speed roads are especially dangerous to bikers even without assholes gunning for you and you shouldn\u0019t risk your life daily for an intangible future.\n\nTry to find likeminded folk though and pressure whatever local governments to address this need for the community.\n\n\"My workplace is out of reach of biking\ndistance.\"\n\nAforementioned carpooling and plotting public transit routes. \n\nSee if it\u0019s possible to bring a bike with you on public transit to fill in gaps on your trips/make it so you don\u0019t have to bike the whole way.\n\nYou can also try asking to work from home, if it\u0019s an option at your workplace and role.\n\n\"I'm too weak to bike.\"\n\nIf you can\u0019t bike for whatever health reasons, then what you need to do to survive is not your fault. Causing yourself to suffer daily for an intangible goal is only going to worsen both your physical and mental health.\n\nAgain though, look into carpooling. A car off the road for whatever reason is a car not creating emissions or at risk of causing an accident\n\n\"I can't carry my groceries on a bike.\"\n\nThere are carriages that can be purchased and towed by a bicycle.\n\nAlternatively, try to line up multiple errands to be done at once and purchase non-perishable items in bulk to reduce your overall number of car trips. Making a list of what you need/are running low on can really help with this.\n\n\"I can't ride a bike in the cold.\"\n\nTry layering up, but don\u0019t kill yourself trying to make it work. There\u0019s a reason there are days we\u0019re told we shouldn\u0019t drive in X weather conditions, and bikes are more susceptible to the whims of the weather.\n\n\"Not everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\"\n\nIt doesn\u0019t have to be a traditional bike. There are other electric or man powered personal vehicles with additional wheels for stabilization.\n\n\"I don't like waiting for the bus.\"\n\nSee the aforementioned carpooling and plotting of a route. \n\nAlso, there are ways to keep ourselves entertained alone now.\n\nAgain, if it\u0019s a significant burden on your time due to public transit being poor, then do what you have to do. Just be sure to take action where you can to rectify it rather than wallow in the misfortune.\n\n\"I don't like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d\n\nAnother fair reason. Germaphobia, claustrophobia, or just a general unease or fear of strangers is a reasonable reason not to take public transit. Do be sure to investigate all your other options before resigning yourself to a personal car though.\n\n\"How can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\"\n\nSee the aforementioned question on the grocery store.\n\n\n\nWe all here know the climate of Earth is changing fast in ways that are unfavorable to life as it currently exists. Radical action needs to be taken to avert the worst effects. Significant changes need to be forced from the top, and society\u0019s not going to go cold turkey on cars tomorrow, but there are a lot of small things that can be done to address the issue, especially when we take action collectively. \n\nWe\u0019re only going to get other people to work with us if we listen and genuinely address their concerns, rather than dismissing them as excuses. We\u0019re not personal trainers, they aren\u0019t coming to us for help; we\u0019re coming to them and so we need to speak on their terms.\n\nEdited to remove a name.",

      "text": "No matter the reason, whether it be pumping out oversized pickup trucks and SUVs, lying about the emissions of their vehicles, actively promoting a car-centric lifestyle, peddling to reactionaries to buy their pickups, shady and unethical business practices, etc. \n\nWhile all auto manufacturers (and most companies) are guilty of unethical practices, it's in the financial interests of the auto manufacturers to ensure a car-centric lifestyle so that people are dependent upon their produces. \n\nRegardless of your reasoning, let me know which auto manufacturer you dislike the most as I'll share you mine. Probably on the top of my list has to be Tesla. \n\nGoing off their products, the notion that battery-electric cars are environmentally friendly is laughable as \n\nA. Electric cars need lots of rare Earth minerals that are mined via slave child labor. \n\nB. Said mining practices are not only unethical but destructive to the environment. \n\nC. Cars are just inherently bad for the environment not just through direct emissions because they require a lot of space which means more forests have to be paved over for roads and parking lots, said surface parking lot creates the urban heat island effect, cars are inefficient and they don't last long mostly due to planned obsolescence, cars kill so many animals directly through road-kill, and cars kill thousands of people each year, and the \"self-driving\" feature of Tesla cars are flawed and shady.\n\nD. Tesla cars burst into flames.\n\nHowever, my primary reason for hating Telsa has to be Elon Musk. Rant warning: Elon Musk is a racist, white South \"African\" i.e settler who got rich off of his parents' emerald mine, has a fucking cult of stans who worship him like he's a God Emperor, and attacks anyone who questions their messiah, and turned Twitter (I refuse to call it X) into a cesspool of racist, reactionary content. He uses child labor in the lithium mines, abuses the workers in the Tesla factories, disregarding their safety, and is just a giant piece of shit. Fuck Elon Musk, Fuck his culty stans, and if anyone drives a Telsa car, note that they are complicit in child labor and exploitation and that they're giving money to a racist piece of shit.\n\n(I know there's no ethical consumption under our current system, but at least try to minimize the impact by not purchasing products from companies that openly practice unethical procedures).\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Tesla is number one on my list of most hated auto manufacturers with Ford being a close second for similar reasons as Henry Ford was an anti-Semitic piece of shit. Let me know what's number one on your list and your reasoning for that. Take care, and stay safe.",

      "text": "Cars are probably one of the dumbest and most wasteful ways you could try to move billions of people around from A to B every day. The average weight of a car is 1300kg, the average weight of a person is  62kg, which means when a person drives to work, over 95% of the energy, resources, space consumed and pollution goes into moving the car itself. Then when you're at work, the car just sits there most the day, taking up space and resources, not being utilised. It's so wasteful, individual transport is just plain stupid. Cars spew out pollution, changing the climate and filling our air with toxic fumes. We breath in micro-particles contained in the exhaust of cars, particles so small they pass through cell membranes and fuck with us, give us cancer and all sorts of diseases. The toxic fumes of cars stink, the engines are noisy, even the wheels are noisy. Endless piles of tyres build up, because cars are designed to need disposable products like wheels.\n\nCars are what you get when the free market is left to decide how we live, there is no plan with cars, it's just millions of individual consumers and companies all deciding to do what is individually good for them, with no greater plan, no coordination, just the wasteful and ignorant direction of the free market producing the cluster fuck on civilisation that is cars and the roads they require. With cars you are forever remaking billions of individual vehicles as each one lives a mere generation, all the while you're constantly remaking endless stretches of roads which eventually crack and wear under the weight of all those cars and trucks. It's madness on a monumental scale, a scale so vast that it changes the landscape and climate of the entire planet.\n\nSo what could we do differently? Almost anything would be better.  Personally I'm an electrified train and tram guy, I think bikes can fill in the gaps, especially electric bikes. I think that if we took a tiny fraction of what we spend on cars collectively as individuals and governments, then applied this tiny fraction to electrified trains, trams, cycling infrastructure and subsidies on bikes and ebikes, we wouldn't want cars. For those situations where the collective system doesn't work, we could always have a few electrified cabs, but those situations are rare in a transportation system organised correctly. The collective benefits from the efficiency, the fresh air, the quiet, the enormous cost savings and sustainability would all make up for any loses to select individuals. Then there are the car enthusiasts, but they're dumb enough that they'd forget about cars quickly enough, besides, they could always just get fucked and find a hobby that doesn't destroy the planet.\n\nI'm also a big believer in relocalisation, alternative systems of planning that don't rely on the free market to decide where people live, systems that have intelligent planning and would produce communities where people live near where they work and can just ride a bike, walk or catch a tram. We often forget that a big part of the problem is that people often live hours from where they work, this is insanely inefficient for billions to be travelling so far every day, simply because the system responsible for organising where individuals live has no intelligence behind it at all and doesn't optimise anything for anyone.\n\nIf I could live in a world without cars I would, but for now as this is just a dream, I'll take solace in the fact that there are others out there like me that find the whole transportation situation in our modern world one of the biggest, dumbest spectacles that this planet will ever have the misfortune of witnessing.",

      "text": "I've had this thought rumbling around in my head for several years now and I've never heard it expressed anywhere. If you listen very many Elon Musk interviews (not recommended) you'll eventually hear him explain how he uses First Principles Thinking to solve engineering problems. The idea is you boil things down to their most fundamental level and work backwards from those simple truths. A classic example is: Electric cars are cost prohibitive because batteries are expensive. OK, well what are batteries even made of? If the raw cost of the materials is low then it stands to reason the cost can be lowered through improving the manufacturing process.\n\nOK, fair enough.\n\nHowever, using First Principles Thinking totally undermines the electric green car fantasy in terms of its ability to solve or mitigate the energy / climate crisis, or even traffic problems. We're asking the wrong question, namely: \"What is the most efficient way to transport every person 30 miles every day using a 4,000lb machine?\" The answer to that question very well may be either a Prius or an electric car. But it's a fucking idiotic question, and constrains your thinking by boxing you in to a particular solution space.\n\nThe correct question is: \"What is the most efficient way to transport everyone in the country to their daily needs, namely: work, school, shopping, and activities?\" And of course the answer is that it's orders of magnitude more efficient to build compact mixed use small towns where everyone can walk/bike/bus (and yes, even drive on occasion for specific purposes) to their daily needs. The laws of physics tell us it will *always* require less energy to move a 200lb person 2 miles rather than 4,200lbs (4,000lb car + 200lb person) 15 miles. *That* is first principles thinking. Stop thinking about how to efficiently move lots of people long distances using individual transport, start thinking about how to get people to their daily needs, since that's what we really care about.\n\nIt's literally as stupid as asking \"How do I efficiently boil 10 gallons of water in order to make a cup of tea?\" Um, stop using a 10-gallon water boiler and switch to a small electric tea kettle. \"But the tea kettle is 10% less efficient on a per-gallon basis!!!\" Yes, even if that's true you're still trying to boil 10 gallons of water just to make a single cup of tea, dumb ass! A slightly less efficient tea kettle that can boil 12 ounces of water will *always* require less energy.\n\nAgain, I don't think these things are very difficult to think through but I've never heard it tied directly to Elon's first principles thinking paradigm.",

      "title": "Any other adult non-drivers here who feel like the world isn't built for you?",
      "text": "Just discovered this sub today. Don't know why the algorithm never recommended it given my history and interests. Can't tell based on the introductory stuff how much of the membership is adult non-drivers, though.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I figured I'd start driving just like everyone else. But when I got behind the wheel for the first time, I was shocked by how it felt. Nothing like I expected. I literally couldn't control the car -- it felt exactly like it ALWAYS wanted to turn left or right and that I could not make it go straight. It looks literally effortless when literally everyone I see drive drives, from real life to movies and tv, but when I had to do it, it felt IMPOSSIBLE. I couldn't and still can't for the life of me understand how anyone does it. No one can explain what they're doing that I'm missing. I get the centipede's dilemma, but this is ridiculous.\n\nDifferent vehicles, different environments, different parent trying to help made no difference in my utter inability to grasp how humans control or direct cars. The first question everyone asks when I reveal this is, Do I have dyslexia? No. Never been diagnosed with anything else, either. I wear glasses because I'm terribly nearsighted, but that's it. No problems with depth perception or balance or dizziness -- I can control a bike and an electric bike just fine, after all -- and it's not even a physical difficulty anyway. I simply can't make a car go straight (or any direction I want), and nobody can tell me why or how they do it. Yes, I've tried again as an adult, and it felt just as impossible as when I was a  teenager. Technically, I'm sure I could keep digging with the help of doctors and find a reason, which could be fixable, but I've chosen not to -- I don't want to risk my and others' lives for something that's not necessary.\n\nSo I've gotten to age 36 in Pittsburgh, PA with no driver's license. I took all road trips by train or bus until I got over my fear of flying during the pandemic. As for local transportation, I began bicycling almost everywhere in college and continue to get around primarily by bike and bus. I got an electric bike 3 years ago, but learned to my surprise and horror that using it affected my ability to ride a regular bike, so it's tragically been sitting the garage for 2 years. I've taken 3 major multi-night bike trips so far (I would do it every year if not for money).\n\nFrom one angle, being a full-time bus rider and bicyclist is 100% doable in my city.  I used my passport for all ID needs until it was about to need renewed. I then used my passport to get a non-driver's state ID, and then used said state ID to renew my passport. I only apply for jobs in places I know I can easily get to by multiple bus or light rail lines, but by coincidence, I've been able to bike to almost every job I've had. I work office jobs (been a legal assistant for the past several years) that don't require a driver's license (so far, only ever applied for 1 promotion 2 employers ago where they rejected me solely for not having a driver's license even though no duties involved driving). I sometimes pick up groceries using my panniers that say \"One Less Car\" but usually use the bus on my way home from work. I can take the cats to the vet on the bus in their carriers. I shamelessly utilize a lot of delivery services like Instacart because in addition to working full time, I'm the primary caregiver for my 100 yr old grandfather, my disabled roommate, and 3 cats and have no guilt about using anything that can help me save time on all the chores and duties I have to fulfill. It's 100% possible to live and function in enough neighborhoods in my city without a car.\n\nBut from another angle, that very fact makes it so frustrating that the world isn't built for people like me. Everywhere you look, the structure reflects how it was designed with the assumption that every visitor or user will have a car. Sure, I can walk up the hills and across dangerous interactions in sprawling shopping plazas, but would it be so hard to construct paths for pedestrians who want to shop? Sure, I have a great pair of waterproof snowboots, but cars get a clear path in winter while I have to stomp through the snow -- is that really fair? We have a few bike lanes, but their locations seem arbitrary, not like they actually make running errands any easier.\n\nI hope it's okay to say the pandemic and Great Resignation have only made things worse. For example, there's a Wendy's literally down the block and right around the corner from our house, but they stopped allowing people inside in March 2020 and are still drive thru only in 2023. This means that the only reason I can't walk down and get food for the same price as other customers is because I don't own a car. I know, first world problems, but if you're going to only serve customers who own a car, at least admit it -- post a sign saying you don't serve people who don't own a car unless they pay twice as much for delivery. If you can't retain enough employees to keep the lobby open, fine, but why can't you allow people to even place an online order and physically walk inside and pick it up? How much more labor can that require? You could put the bags on a shelf where people can walk in and grab it with no employee needing to do anything! How is that more labor than if a Grubhub or Doordash driver for the order went through the drive thru? Nope, if you don't own a car, you're not worthy of being our customer, and you're not welcome here. This was pervasive in 2020, but with no reason for \"nobody allowed inside\" now but lack of employees, it's really frustrating to come across businesses that have decided anybody who doesn't own a car is so far beneath their notice that it's not worth giving them an easy, obvious, common way to pick up an order that doesn't require any more labor than the drive thru does. Not only are non-drivers freaks who don't deserve consideration, they don't exist -- after all, who DOESN'T drive everywhere?\n\nOn occasions where I have to think about it, this \"everyone drives\" mentality and the resulting world built for cars (where I live, anyway) alternates between making me roll my eyes and shake my head and the irrationality and feeling depressed. I live closer to the way the anti-global warming media says I should... and I get punished for it with arbitrary restrictions and unnecessary obstacles! Meanwhile, the people using and relying on what so many now call evil and dirty are rewarded with a system that caters to them. Hell, yeah, fuck cars and the narrowminded urban planners and business owners who were never taught what a bike is!",

      "text": "A day or so ago, the BBC posted a [quiz](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348) about how we as individuals can minimize our CO2 emissions based on a [meta-analysis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/pdf) of 6,992 studies. The study of course, was not about individual choices, saying \"Here we argue that a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches provides a robust base for the review of the mitigation potentials of consumption options.\"\n\nIn question 3 on the BBC, they ask \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" However, the study found that the \"best transport choice\" is neither of these. The study found, \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options\" (their emphasis).\n\nSo, I am typing an email to the BBC's corrections department, to change question 3 to accurately represent the study to say that living car-free is the best transportation option.\n\nIn case they decide to re-word the question to ask \"Which is the better transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" I am also arguing that the study does a poor job of accounting for the real-world factors of Tesla vs. bus, namely:\n\n1. it does not account for CO2 emissions from construction of the vehicle.\n2. it does not ask where the electric car gets its electricity from.\n3. it does not make a traffic analysis; use of mass transit makes fossil-fuel cars less polluting by reducing traffic\n4. it assumes only short urban trips can be replaced with mass transit; the study found that public transit has CO2 emissions as low as 0.00-0.09 kg/km depending on the fuel source, since public transit is sometimes electrified anyway. Looking only at the exhaust pipe (which our study does), mass transit and electric cars are almost identical.\n\n.\n\nI provide my letter below and invite everyone to restate it in your own words asking that Question #3 be corrected to \"living car-free.\" The part about comparing electric vs mass is optional.\n\n.\n\nTo: [newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk](mailto:newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk) \\[newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk\\]\n\nBBC,\n\nI recently saw your quiz ([https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348)) on how individuals can make personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint. Your quiz was based on [this University of Leeds study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/meta). Question 3 asks \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate?\" The study found that \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options,\"  (emphasis theirs). However, your quiz only lists \"electric car\" and  \"public transport\" as options for \"the best transport choice.\" The  correct answer in your quiz, according to the study, should be \"Living  car-free.\"\n\nBut  even if we wanted to compare electric cars to mass transit and ask the  better choice, there are four important aspects of the study to  consider.\n\n1. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe. Obviously electric is  zero, but mass transit varied between 0.00 kg/km (for electric buses  and trains) to 0.09 kg/km. Compare that to fossil fuel cars, which the  study found to have emissions between 0.6 and 3.6 depending on the  model, and electric and mass transit are almost identical. The study  assumed that mass transit would only replace \"short and urban car  trips,\" meaning the other trips were calculated as being done with a  fossil-fuel car. It's not a fair comparison.\n2. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the electric power plant it charges from. [This study](http://idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/Tesla_Motors.pdf) found that Tesla electric cars still generated 0.0461 kg/km when the grid is based on natural gas.\n3. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the CO2 released from production of the vehicle. [This Politifact article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/11/viral-image/producing-electric-cars-battery-does-not-emit-same/)  notes that just producing one electric car's battery can generate  between 4,500 and 7,500 kg of CO2, depending on the electricity source  of the factory. While buses also emit CO2 just by being built, this  value should be divided by its average ridership, which unfortunately  the Leeds study does not touch on.\n4. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering a traffic analysis. If more people take mass transit, there is less  traffic on the road, meaning the fossil-fuel-burning cars become more  fuel efficient. If they are replaced with electric cars, there is no reduction in traffic.\n\nThe  study is very helpful for a lot of reasons, but question number 3  should not be a comparison between electric cars and mass transit. It  should simply state that the \"best transport choice\" is living car-free,  as the study reports.\n\nBest regards,\n\n***\\[your IRL name\\]***\n\n***\\[your IRL email address\\]***",

      "text": "I had originally typed this up as a comment, but I decided to make it a full text post. \n\nIf we build our cities to be more walkable, while keeping accessibility in mind, then people who have difficulty walking will *also* have an easier time getting around. \n\nDo you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to get an electric wheelchair in and out of a vehicle? Have you ever tried to cram a folded manual wheelchair into the trunk of a compact car? Do you know how expensive any form of wheelchair-friendly private transportation is, whether you own that vehicle or not? It sucks! Right now, many disabled people have to rely on cars driving up close to the building. \n\nBut, if more people lived in more walkable places (that were also accessible to mobility devices), then they could get around their own neighborhoods much more freely. Instead of switching between transportation modes multiple times in a simple trip (which is exhausting), they could just use one mode the entire time, just like abled people do when they walk somewhere. I\u0019ve watched disabled family members struggle with getting in and out of the car, trying to park as close as possible, and leaning on a shopping cart the whole time they\u0019re in a big box store. They couldn\u0019t easily go anywhere, so going out was necessities-only. But if they had a walkable neighborhood, well-kept sidewalks with curb cuts, and nearby markets? They could have gone out so much more easily, just by switching to a Rollator or wheelchair. (Well, it\u0019s hilly here, so maybe an electric wheelchair or some other electric-assisted device would be the best option.) \n\nMobility devices can be incredibly expensive. But cars are significantly more expensive, and in a car-dependent place, you don\u0019t have a choice. If I need to use a very expensive electric wheelchair, I have three choices: I could buy just the wheelchair, and either risk my life riding to the grocery store along a highway, or lose a big chunk of independence by needing someone else to drive me around. I could buy just the car, and go through the shitty song and dance described above. Or I could buy both, go through a different shitty song and dance, and also have the debt collectors beating down my door. Because unfortunately, being disabled in America often also means being poor. \n\nAll of this only addresses basic needs, like getting groceries or going to the doctor. Imagine if my disabled family members had actually been able to go to a park, or a library, or a hangout spot whenever they wanted to. They could only do that very rarely. \n\nLastly, there are a lot of people on the borderline of needing mobility aids. I\u0019m one of them! Sometimes I get horrible fatigue episodes where even sitting up unsupported is a struggle. But most of the time, I can walk around just fine. I don\u0019t own a wheelchair, and sometimes I have to rely on my car (or just stay in). My disabled family members are also on that borderline. It\u0019s not a black-and-white thing, where you\u0019re either paralyzed from the waist down or you can run miles every day. Disability is complicated. And when we\u0019re all trapped inside our houses, inside our cars, and leaning on shopping carts, it\u0019s easier to pretend we\u0019re not here. But disabled people have been here for as long as there have been people. Maybe more people using a wheelchair sometimes, and more people being visibly disabled more often, would reduce the stigma around looking disabled. \n\nTl;dr: disabled people only rely on cars in car-dependent places because they have to. Mobility aids become more useful, and neighborhoods become more accessible, when they are not centered around cars. Car-centric towns are more structurally ableist than accessible walkable towns.",

      "title": "Cars are the original antisocial behavior. ",
      "text": "There's long been a concept, 'broken windows' whereby once you let certain things slide, a sort of reverse gentrification takes over and that part of a town or city starts dying. \n\nI'd argue that the process more typically begins with planning or accommodating car use, and that this leads to a spiral of community destruction that has a role in the general increase in other types of antisocial behavior and crime. It leads to degeneration of civic and neighbourhood pride, causes children to be herded indoors, the lack of play leads to increased family stress, poorer child socialisation and increases in psychological problems, mental illness, impulse control problems and drug use and other negative behaviours, and health effects like morbid obesity. \n\nNoise is also one of the big factors affecting sleep and healthy development, but also we know of other factors like the historical lead poisoning. \n\nHow clear this is to me is thanks to a chance sequence of events that led to me moving away for some time from my car centric society (suburbs, Britain) to several towns and cities in western Ukraine. \n\nIn my current city, there is literally no need to own or use a car, unless you are miles out of city limits. Trans and trolley buses are extensively used. Urban population density is much higher than suberbs, most apartment blocks are 5 to 9 stories. \n\nThere is almost zero morbid obesity. Children and teenagers exhibit few signs of behavioural problems. There is play areas in every group of apartment buildings. Whilst their are parked cars, few cars are actually moving and there is no through roads in these spaces. Children play outside with a adult nearby from morning to night. There is no gangs, you would not worry that leaving your kids to roam as teenagers will get them drawn into hard drugs or crime, no signs of antisocial behavior except the odd drunk but they typically just mind themselves quietly. \n\nPolice stations are numerous and included in some of these apartment complexes. Shops occupy the first floor on all major streets. \n\nSo it's better than a 15 minute city for most things. \n\nBeing a parent here seems far easier when your kids can play outside your apartment block with other kids. As they grow older there are many safe spaces and parks and completely segregated cycle lanes. This extensive play seems to be vital for the development of children, and since the diet isn't particularly better in terms of junk food, I strongly feel explains the overall highly civil behavior of Ukrainians and the apparently improved behavior and lack of psychological and impulse problems in children and teens, who almost never exhibit threatening or antisocial behaviors. \n\nTraffic congestion and volumes are very light compared to western cities. It's eminently possible to go completely car free and rent a parking spot if you wanted a car at the city boundary. \n\nAnother interesting thing, there are curfews so no travelling outside after 12 midnight. This seems to have no negative impacts except make it quieter. The fact is cars are not needed in cities like this, with the exception of maybe disability vehicles for some users., and perhaps for some families. \n\nAlso, the electric micro scooters every authority seems to hate in the west, are very popular here and easily available for rent. I would estimate that on cycle lanes their use out numbers bike use by at least 2 to 1. Anything that makes cars seem more irrelevant is a good idea. One potential improvement could be a rentable cargo e bike scheme. \n\nEven towards the edges where big shed marts are to be found, these are usually served by tram stops, and an interesting thing that would strike you about these, is how much smaller the space used for parking is at these locations. One plot has a large mall, a car park that is so small that the space you would see taken up in the west for parking (and then some) is instead planned for being used to squeeze in a large multistory apartment block, of 12 or so stories.

      "text": "I'm new in this sub and I genuinely wasn't aware of how car-centric most US cities are.\n\nI live in a european capital city, though in the outskirts. Every weekend I walk 15 minutes to the train station, then ride the train for 25 minutes to meet up with my friends. The train is always full, most people take public transportation to the city because it has so many connections. Once I'm there with my friends we spend the entire day walking around, taking breaks to eat lunch/a snack/dinner somewhere and going into stores. Cars are not really 'allowed' in the capital city and if you need to go by car there are only 4 lanes, and most of the time they are for buses or sometimes taxis to take people to their hotel. If you drive your car to the city and you park for over a certain amount of minutes (can't remember exactly) you get a ticket. And there aren't even that many parking spots anywhere, only near hospitals and such, for obvious reasons.\n\nThere is a lot of greenery everywhere and people can rent bikes and electric scooters to visit the city instead of taking their car. There are also tour buses and small vehicles connected (?) to a bike where people sit and a guide drives them around. The city is old and the buildings are beautiful. \n\nThis is all thanks to plenty of car laws becoming effective years ago (because pollution was getting out of hand) and they started letting only the vehicles with an odd plate number one day and an even number the next day in the city center. Then they forbid the vehicles that came out before a certain year (2006 I think?) from going in. Soon it became difficult and tiring to even drive there and now most people take the train or bus and the 'cloud' of pollution over the city is starting to go away! The levels of pollution in most areas are green \\*which means good air quality\\* and only very few are yellow. I wish this happened to every city.

Cars are complex, expensive, and dangerous objects that inflict all kinds of psychological damage on people in car-centric transit infrastructure. We're pushed into debt to buy the newest bright-and-shinys, or can just barely afford a cheap car to begin with, then feel guilty when we can't afford to maintain them properly, a part of car ownership that is allowed to just go by the wayside in the US. To me, /r/Justrolledintotheshop provides reminders of just how normal it is a) to let car maintenance go completely to hell, b) for people's need for transportation to overcome the most insane and personally unsafe conditions, and c) for us to do nothing about it collectively because lost lives are considered an acceptable cost of driving even under optimal conditions, so what's a little more on the side?\n\n/r/Justrolledintotheshop is obviously a sub that likes cars and sees some consistent problems with how people use cars. But the users tend to indicate lack of personal responsibility as the culprit, hence the sub being dedicated to \"absolutely stupid things.\" Because it is true under any system that some portion of the population will act irresponsibly, it is obviously true that some car drivers neglect maintenance out of their own failings. But I think we can agree here that the scale of the problem is evidence of the fact that, *even if it is true* that tons of people are not inherently responsible enough to maintain a car, we shouldn't force everyone to own cars.",

      "title": "Why drive a Tesla when a WWII-era steam train can outdo it in emissions?",
      "text": "***WARNING: MATH AHEAD***\n\nSo recently, I watched an episode of the amazing podcast Well There\u0019s Your Problem, specifically episode 113 discussing battery-electric locomotives [1]. Around the 56 minute mark, host Justin Roczniak remarks that he and Tom Coletti did some \u001cback of the napkin math\u001d to determine the relative environmental impact of transporting passengers on a steam-locomotive powered train versus electric automobiles, and came to a pretty shocking conclusion about the break-even point. After seeing this, I was inspired to do the math myself and see if I could replicate his conclusions, here\u0019s what I found.\n\nWe\u0019ll start with the steam locomotive in question: for my math, I used Union Pacific FEF-3 locomotive number 844. This locomotive was built in 1944, and was frequently employed on passenger trains up until around 1957. Soon afterwards, it became one of the last surviving mainline steam locomotives still in use and was used from then onwards as a PR ambassador for the Union Pacific. This locomotive represents the state-of-the-art for steam locomotive design as it was when the art ended following WWII. \n\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the UP, the 844 has a fuel capacity of 6,200 gallons of No. 5 fuel oil, and one full tank will give the locomotive a range of approx. 300 miles [2]. This means that the engine burns around 21 gallons per mile. According to Climatiq, No. 5 fuel oil emits 10.24 kilograms of CO2e per gallon burned [3]. \n\n21gal per mile * 10.24kg CO2e per gal = 215.04kg of CO2e per mile\n\nTo make the math later on a little easier, I\u0019ll convert 215.04 kilograms to 215,040 grams.\n\nNext, let\u0019s take a look at the emissions from electric vehicles. Remember, although these vehicles do not directly pollute, the electric grid that these vehicles often get their charge from does. For my math, I decided to use the Tesla Model Y, simply for the fact that it is the best selling electric vehicle in the US. According to a study published to Statista, a Model 3 charged off of the US grid will emit 116 grams of CO2e per mile [4]. \n\nNow for the fun part. We\u0019ve established an apples-to-apples comparison for emissions from the 844 and the Model Y, so now we can simply divide and find the quotient:\n\n215040g / 116g H 1853.79\n\nSo it takes about 1854 Teslas to equal one 844 in terms of CO2e per mile. Assuming one person in each of those Teslas, how many passenger cars will the 844 need to pull in order to carry 1854 passengers? Let\u0019s give 844 the best shot possible by having it pull St Louis Car Company Bi-Level Commuter Coaches. These cars have a pretty high capacity of 169 seats per car, and when loaded have a weight of around 79 tons (62 tons for the empty car, plus 17 from the 169 200-pound passengers aboard) [5]. \n\n1854 / 169 H 10.97\n\nSo, with 11 passenger cars behind it, the 844 has broken even and produces less CO2e per mile than a fleet of Teslas. In the podcast, Justin says his math came out to about 10 cars, so we can say that his math is about right. Now for the even more important question, how fast can the 844 go with those 11 cars? Well, at 72 tons per car, this train would weigh 792 tons total. To find speed per train weight, I will refer to a set of charts used by the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 30s-early 40s to calculate tonnage ratings. On page 22, we see a chart for the FEF-1 class locomotives, which are similar enough to the FEF-3s to be comparable. At 792 tons, this train could reach nearly 100 MPH on flat track; just shy of 70 MPH on a 0.5% uphill grade; and just over 50 MPH on a 1% grade [6].\n\nTLDR:\n\nWhen pulling 11 bi-level commuter coaches, a 1944 steam locomotive produces less emissions per mile than if all the passengers in those coaches were to drive individual Teslas. Not only that, but this train could pull those coaches on flat track at a much higher speed than those Teslas could legally drive on our highways today, and at speeds similar to highways even when climbing hills. Keep all of this in mind whenever people try to tell you that electric vehicles are the way out of our current climate crisis. They aren\u0019t. Trains are.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0qcxyyllQ4\n[2]: https://www.up.com/heritage/steam/844/\n[3]: https://www.climatiq.io/data/emission-factor/d0440c0d-4ffc-4838-9079-43df928f54f3\n[4]: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401887/tesla-lifecycle-emissions-model-3-model-y-by-selected-countries-and-regions/#:~:text=While%20the%20emissions%20from%20a,Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.%2C%20respectively.\n[5]: https://www.irm.org/player/cnw1/?roster_type=custom\n[6]: https://utahrails.net/flebbe-papers/UP_Horsepower-Curves-and-Tonnage-Ratings-Charts.pdf\n",

And that, if leafy, could reject more heat.\n\nAlthough a component of long term temperature rise is caused by GHG, and some of that undoubtedly human, a big component of what humanity experiences as extreme heat is due to the additional urban heat island increasing over time from built area and human energy using activities.\n\nEdit, to be more accurate, I should say, that a lot of the long term trend of increased *experienced* extreme heat, is due to cars.",

      "text": "I attempted to post this article in r/Australia though had it deleted with no reason given, so figured I'd preach it to the choir instead :-) \n\nTL:DR at end.\n\nRecently there have been a flood of articles in Australian media with titles like \"Concerns increase in fires linked to lithium-ion batteries in e-scooters and e-bikes\". One online ABC article about the issue was originally posted with the false statement that \"Hundreds of e-scooters and e-bikes are catching fire in Australian homes...\" That wildly inaccurate bit of information has since been removed, but not before a [Google crawler indexed it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hundreds+of+e-scooters+and+e-bikes+are+catching+fire+in+Australian+homes)\n\nDespite media reports to the contrary, e-scooters and e-bikes are not bursting into flames at an alarming rate. Over 5.5 years to mid 2022, there were less than 100 lithium-ion battery fires in Australia reported to the ACCC; remember, a dozen or more lithium-ion battery containing products can be found in the average Australian home today, including in laptops, tablets, children's toys, drills, etc. [Only 9 (yes nine) of those fires were caused by batteries inside e-mobility devices.](https://consultation.accc.gov.au/accc/lithium-ion-batteries-issues-paper/supporting_documents/ACCC%20Lithiumion%20Batteries%20Issues%20Paper.pdf) Nine e-scooter and e-bike fires over 5.5 years, compared to 10's of thousands of car fires over the same period (speculative based on [&gt;9,000 car fires in NSW alone in just a 36-month period](https://www.fireextinguisheronline.com.au/blog/post/electric-vehicle-fire-extinguisher-australia)).\n\nSo why the media frenzy on these devices being a risk? Vehicle manufacturers and energy companies have been manipulating the media and controlling the narrative around transport options for 100 years now ([reference 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOttvpjJvAo), [reference 2](https://www.drilledpodcast.com/)), they are world renowned experts at [manufacturing consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU).\n\nIn urban areas, a substantial amount of the distance we drive is for short trips, easily achievable by e-mobility devices. In Sydney, [50% of all vehicle km driven are for trips less than 5km](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/HTS%20Report%20Sydney%202012-13.pdf). If we are allowed to view new e-mobility options as the cheap, convenient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, spatially sustainable, and relatively safe products that they are, then we'll stop driving cars as much as we do. In turn, we'd also start demanding governments do more to make our streets safer for those who aren't driving cars... which in turn will cause more people take up alternative transport options.\n\nLeft unchecked, e-mobility devices have the potential to significantly reduce the amount we drive cars in our cities; this will hurt the bottom line of amongst the richest and most powerful businesses in the world. Something they will not allow to happen without a fight. Their decades old signature move? Narrative control and media manipulation.\n\nTL:DR; E-scooters and e-bikes are not catching fire at the rate the media is portraying, not even remotely. It is likely the usual powers are at work to ensure the general public are terrified of any transport option that is not a privately owned car.",

      "text": "The title says it all, and I've just experienced two recent instances of drivers being absolute inconsiderate fucks on the road. Two days in a damn row, mind you. I live in the Inland Empire of Southern California, which, as much as I absolutely love, is unfortunately very heavily car-dependent. \n\nThe first was when I was riding my electric scooter to work yesterday morning. A driver in an older truck literally backed up on the right side of the fucking road, back to the intersection. I shit you not. Luckily, I stopped when the light turned red when the idiot was still backing up into the other road at the intersection. What an absolute dumbass. Like, who the fuck even does that shit? Why the fuck did they even turn right onto that street in the first place, then? \n\nThe second instance, though involving a motorcycle, literally just happened an hour ago. I was on a walk, and then this fucking idiot on a dirt bike was blocking the whole crosswalk while waiting for the light to turn green, even after I began crossing after waiting for the walk signal to appear. Well, right around when I finished crossing, this motherfucker decided it was a brilliant idea to just impatiently turn left onto a fucking sidewalk and just drive on it... where I just was a couple minutes back. Like, are you really that fucking inconsiderate of others and in that much of a rush? What if there was a pedestrian in front of them? The fuck is their problem?\n\nOh, yeah. Here's another similar story with another dirt bike rider. One afternoon, after I got off the bus after work, and as I walked up towards my house, yet another dumbass fucking idiot drove their dirt bike on the dirt off the street next to the sidewalk that I was walking on... in a direction heading towards ME! I wish I was joking. This occurred some time this past year. \n\nOh, and not to mention those times when I began crossing the street at a damn intersection, but someone still decides to start driving as I'm doing so, anyway. How fun is that? \n\nI just absolutely HATE it when those kind of drivers do all this fucking bullshit! Pisses me the fuck off!\n\nSo, yeah. I just wanted to rant about how those two occurrences are making me hate vehicles more lately. And, I said to myself that I've been wanting to practice more on driving. Yeah, right. I'm not even sure if it's worth continuing to do so, and it's exactly mainly because of all those fucking idiots just like them on the road! Fuck vehicles (yes, I realize my e-scooter counts as a vehicle, as well, but still)! Okay, except busses. They're cool with me, and I've been taking the bus for years, but that's besides the point.",

      "text": "This sub has... got weird lately.\n\nThere seems to be an increasing number of comments (and a few posts) that basically consist of:\n\n* Step One: somebody claims a person/people have agency and criticise how they use that agency\n* Step Two: someone else says \"don't hate the player, hate the game\" (or words to that effect)\n\nTo use a recent actual example that you can find with some detective work:\n\n&gt;The necessity of having a personal car is one of the biggest myths perpetuated in the U.S. and way overblown for many people\n&gt;&gt;I\u0019m glad that your lifestyle doesn\u0019t necessitate ownership of a car. I know the sub is literally called fuck cars lol, but they are a necessity for many of us. It requires far too much time and effort to ride a bike or bus to the store, to work, or to go anywhere else when you\u0019re in a hurry\n\nI guess respect to this guy for having the self awareness to know they're arguing against the thesis of r/fuckcars but I want to break down why comments like this are carbrained themselves. For my own convenience, I will use a case study of Auckland ([here are some pictures of what its suburbs looks like](https://imgur.com/a/gYVgnLe)).\n\nIn Auckland, [75% of pre-covid commute journeys were less than 12km long and 50% were less than 6km.](https://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2021/02/11/double-is-nothing/) These aren't walking distance trips but they are cycling distances... [a Google search](https://truecommuter.com/what-is-the-average-commuting-bike-speed/) tells me a *beginner* commuting cyclist can do 12km in 45 minutes and 6km in 22.5 minutes. A more experienced cyclist will bring those travel times down to 30 and 15 minutes (and, of course, there are ebikes to consider these days). [Nevertheless, some 73% of commutes in the data set are done in private vehicles](https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Report/TheCongestionQuestionsTechnicalReport.pdf) (10% as passengers, mind).\n\nChoosing to drive these commutes is a choice. And the more people that make this choice, the worse things are. Always remember, \"you're not in traffic, you are traffic\". \n\nIf you're a libertarian, congestion should really drive you up the wall... it's a situation where people refuse to take ownership of their own decisions and as a result inflict congestion, more pollution and dangerous parking behaviours on everyone else. And if you don't think this, you're not a libertarian. Now, if you're not a libertarian I'm sure you're wondering something along the lines of \"but how free is that choice, really?\" and you'd be right to wonder that.\n\nIn many respects, the answer (in Auckland) is \"not much\". Safe cycling infrastructure is mostly not a thing. However, some exists. In fact, there are a fair few Youtube videos showing some of it off (there are some geographic biases in the ones I've found). [This dude's demonstrates some of the pitfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9z-6i3uQ8Y)... shared paths and sections where you're just on an ordinary road. Of course, it's not just about cycling: there's also public transport.\n\nAuckland has a very simple to understand network. If you live in South Auckland proper, you're living close to a rail line. If you live in much of West Auckland, you're not so far from a rail line. If you live in inner East, there's a rail line. If you live on the North Shore, you're reasonably likely to be close to a bus rapid transit system that's largely responsible for creating some major modeshift on the Harbour Bridge (pre-Covid). And then if you live anywhere else, you've basically got bus connections (with sketchy priority) to these \"frequent\" and \"rapid\" links or ferries... lots of ferries.\n\nBefore Covid, this was a very reliable system but it wasn't necessarily fast. According to the timetables, the new electric trains (as in, electrification happened in 2014/15) with a 110km/h top speed, are no faster than 19th Century steam trains. However, a reliable 55 minute or so commute from 30km out isn't so bad. I know because I did it... and a lot of people did it, too: growth was *very* strong. Since Covid reliability has been way down because it turns out that the owner of the tracks doesn't do maintenance. Also, since delta timetables have been cut back and patronage is, I think, at something like 20% of its previous levels (in the halcyon days of Level One it was back to 60-70% of the pre-Covid levels).\n\nIn other words, I strongly believe that for the 75% of people with sub 12km commutes, the vast majority would have functional and reliable public transport options. They'd be slower than cars, but they wouldn't necessarily be egregiously so. And, sure, Western Line trains go no distance at all from the CBD compared to the Southern line (as the crow flies, the former's stations are almost all within 12km, the latter can be as much as 30km out) but an hour's commute is not so bad. My point being here is that \"slower\" doesn't necessarily mean \"too long\". There would need to be *some* adjustment of expectations *but that's not a bad thing.*\n\nOf course, it's not just about active modes and public transport either. People can make choices about how they're living. And I don't mean \"why don't you just live closer to your work?\". I mean, \"why do you own that vehicle specifically?\".\n\nAbsolutely no-one needs a double cab ute. Not a single soul. If you actually need a ute, you're not really travelling in circumstances where you've got passengers. If you are, you probably should have a van instead. Or, possibly, a station wagon.\n\nIt is true that car manufacturers have made a concerted effort to upsize vehicles. It is also true that they advertise in wildly misleading fashions (i.e. empty roads). However, if you're buying a vehicle, you can just choose to buy something else. You absolutely should be criticised for buying a vehicle that's bigger than your needs. You absolutely should be criticised for buying more vehicles than you need. No-one has taken away all the other (much cheaper, more fuel efficient, safer) kinds of vehicles: they are still on car lots waiting to be bought.\n\nNow, a common turn on r/auckland (and maybe here but I can't say with confidence I've seen such claims) is to protest that modern housing developments don't have enough parking spaces. On one hand, this is just a defence of parking minimums. You know, probably the most despised urban planning rule after single family dwelling prescriptions (R1 zoning)... though, none of the top 150 posts on this sub are directly about this (as far as I can tell, [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/smmv3j/just_imagine_all_the_space_that_could_have_been/) was the first I could find but there are lots of comments on the general theme of \"cars take up too much space\"). On the other hand, this is being used specifically as a defence of stuff like in a recent[xpost from](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ts20k9/i_dont_have_words_for_this/) r/mildlyinfuriating, i.e. the privatisation of public space.\n\nIt is not remotely unreasonable to point out that if you can't afford to buy enough land to park your family's seven cars, you shouldn't own seven cars. This is a lifestyle *choice* people are choosing to make that is both derived from and exacerbating the poor design choices of carbrained cities like Auckland. It's probably also relatively easy to fix... I'm sure you've heard that in Japan, you can't buy a car unless you can prove you have private land to park it on (whether you own that space or lease it). I think this is why r/neoliberal is/was so anti-car... the whole system of the carbrained city is only able to exist because of mass subsidisation by the state, which is inefficient.\n\nSo, to sum up... I guess what I'm saying is:\n\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean your trips are actually too far to cycle\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean every possible cycling trip is unsafe\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean using public transport is excessively time consuming\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you *had* to buy a tank sized vehicle\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you need more cars than household members\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you should use public roads to store your cars\n\nAnd most importantly\n\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you have to defend carbrain!\n\nThere are lots of other choices that people make because of carbrain that if they just chose to do something else would make cars so much less problematic. If you can't come to r/fuckcars to criticise these choices (without having to qualify that you know some of them aren't wholly free choices), what is even the point of this sub?\n\nCarbrained cities are created and perpetuated because people like [Phil Goff (Auckland's mayor) use carbrained arguments](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/qmj23m/transport_agency_proposes_reducing_car_parking/). It is not enough to just recognise carbrained design, you also have to recognise the rhetoric that is used to defend and constitute it.",

I saw the post comparing the number one selling car in the UK to the number one vehicle in the US which is the F150 which is almost the same comparison I did when I was comparing my car to buying an E-Bike. Earlier this year I sold my car to purchase an E-Bike. I think I saw an ad maybe a year ago or maybe it was somebody riding one but it really got me thinking, why do I need a 5 passenger car to drive me to work and back every single day? Literally 20 miles every day (M-F) of just me sitting in my car to get to work and back. I probably only transported maybe 3 people a year in my car FOR YEARS. I sat there starting at the wall like why am I screwing up the environment, wasting money, and using up space just for a thing to get me to a job. A place I go to as a way to pay for the thing that gets me to work. \n\nObviously I decided I didn't need the car. \n\nGroceries? \nCargo E-Bike can handle it. \n\nTransport kids?\n No worries bike can fit two kids seats.\n\nGetting to work? \nEasy peasy and only adds 30 minutes total to my daily commute.\n\nWhat about AC? \nYeah turns out riding at decent speed while wearing summer clothes keeps you pretty cool.\n\nCold? \nNo worries, the world has plenty of clothes to grab to keep you warm. Including electric clothes if you really want a heater.\n\nAnyways, I really enjoy the message in this sub and hope to help spread the narrative.",

      "text": "I live in the Netherlands but maybe my question applies worldwide. Though I'm too unaware of traffic laws in other countries to say anything about it. But here, Netherlands:\n\nExmple:\n\n1. There is a 50 km/hr road and bike path next to eachother. The bike path is full of fat tree roots and holes, which could damage my bike and could also cause me to fall if I don't pay attention for even one second. It would be safer for me to use the perfectly smooth road next to it, but no thats illegal, I have to use the bike path because the traffic sign says so.\n2. You have a 45 km/hr ebike. Your battery is empty so you ride at legpower, 15 km/hr. But are you allowed to use the bike path? No, the category of your vehicle makes you \"fast traffic\" regardless of the speed you ride with, so you have to use the road where cars fly past with 50+. How stupid is that!\n3. Fast mopeds legally have to use the 50km/hr road, but they are not allowed to actually drive 50. They are max allowed 45. You can imagine how much danger and frustration that causes when cars are behind. Seriously, why that weird number 45 and not 50?\n4. 25 km/hr ebikes you don't need a helmet or anything at all. 25 km/hr moped you need a helmet and insurance and drivers license. Why does this difference exist...\n5. If you race downhill, or get tailwind and go 40 km/h, thats perfectly fine. No need for a helmet, no need for insurance, no need for drivers license. But have an ebike assist more than 25 kmhr? You need these 3 things. Why would assisted 30 km/hr be more dangerous than unassisted 40?\n\nSome laws are dangerous to obey, (see 1 and 2 and 3), some laws are just weird (see 3 and 4 and 5)\n\nAlot of traffic laws don't make any sense at all, some of them look like someone who has never participated in traffic themselves made them up randomly.\n\nI just wonder why. Who comes up with those silly stupid laws / signs and why? Why are there so many restricting laws instead of giving people the freedom to determine what is the safest way for them to participate in traffic? I often find myself doing dangerous things as a result of obeying dangerous traffic laws because I do not want to get fined. These stupid laws achieve the exact opposite of what they were intended for.\n\nThere is already a law that basically says \"creating danger or hinder in traffic is illegal\" (Which contradicts the laws mentioned in 1 and 2 and 3 by the way), and that law alone should cover everything and be enough. If people obeyed that law, traffic would be nice. If people don't obey that law, they aren't going to obey other laws anyways. So I don't see the point of all these laws that are already covered by another law anyways. So why?",

      "text": "I went on a 5-day trip to Barcelona, where I got an electric bike pass for a week so I can get around easily. Thankfully, Barcelona is full of bike lanes and it should be trivial to get around without having to deal with cars and traffic. Or so i thought.\n\n  \n\n\nThe way the roads are structured there is pretty simple: There's a main car road with 6 lanes for cars, and on both sides of said road, there's a smaller single lane road for buses and bicycles. That way bikes and buses don't have to block traffic and cars don't have to inconvenience us. **Or so it would be if the drivers actually obeyed the rules.**\n\n  \n You see, cars don't care what those lanes were made for - they see a length of asphalt and they automatically assume that it's made for their stupid vehicle. The bike/bus lanes are FULL of cars, and because of that, they're always packed and it's impossible for buses and bikes to use them.\n\n  \n\n\n*Well*, you may say, *they at least know that they're using bike lanes and make space for the vehicles they were intended for*. Oh, you sweet summer child. While i was riding my bicycle **on the designated lane**, for my 4 days on bike, 13 cars passed me less than an inch away from me - 2 were **police cars -** and a lady even threw her empty soda cup at me. **These pigs don't consider us a part of traffic**.\n\nLastly, while i was riding my bike on the sidewalk, I noticed that there was a strip of asphalt made for wheelchairs and disabled people so they can ride smoothly. It wasn't connected to the main road, and for a car to use it, it would have to climb onto the curb and drive **like 20 yards on the sidewalk.** And guess what? *there was a fucking car on it*. A car, on a fucking strip of asphalt intended for disabled people. Jesus. Fucking. Christ.\n\n  \n\n\nA lack of infrastructure isn't the problem. Cars as a transport method are.",

Because of Car-centric infrastructure. ](https://preview.redd.it/4z18g7w8dvba1.jpg?width=919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d68188f058dc02767ea22adad988e072047f14)\n\nThe Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, popularly referred to as the 'Evo', is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to date. Lancer Evolutions were successful in WRC Rallies from 1996 to 1999, mostly in the hands of Finnish driver Tommi Mäkinen, clinching driver's titles in four-consecutive seasons from 1996 to 1999 (in Evolutions III, IV, V, and VI). Note that start date of 1992. Between 1992 and 2016, world population rose by over 1 billion, however our public transport infrastructure failed to adapt to this change appropriately, especially in the united states, with car dependent infrastructure. This then shifted the market for vehicles away from sports orientated vehicles, as more \"\"\"\"\"\"\"practical\"\"\"\"\"\"\" utility vehicles came into demand instead. Because of public transport not being adapted to the population change, more people needed \"commuter purpose\" vehicles, as they could not commute via alternative methods due to alternative methods either being overloaded and hence seen as unappealing (e.g. underdeveloped metros) or straight up absent (e.g. Intercity HighSpeed rail), limiting them to own a car that would be suited for more frequent use as opposed to a purpose sport vehicle. In late March 2014, it was revealed that the production of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution would end after the 2015 model year. Mitsubishi instead wished to focus on \"concentrating its efforts on crossover vehicles and electric vehicles instead.\"\n\nTL:DR; I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS",

But instead of yelling at the driver, I asked the pizzeria owner if he could ask the driver to move his truck from the bike path, telling him that first of all it\u0019s illegal for motorized vehicles to even stop on the bike path or sidewalk, and secondly it was creating a dangerous situation where cyclists including children would have to drive into the street to get around the truck.\n\nAnd it worked! To my surprise the pizzeria owner talked to the driver, the driver stopped unloading and went out to move his truck off the bike path and onto the street, cars can easily get around.\n\nI\u0019m guessing the pizzeria owner didn\u0019t want to risk a bad review of his place.\n\nOf course I then go to ÿMaps and look at their version of Streetview, called [Look Around](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi-Up8Xuh9c) and see that a truck is parked half on the bike path and half on the bike path.\n\n#This is why we need fucking curbs",

I\u0019m terrible with directions, and the anxiety of directing a ton+ vehicle of steel alongside many others who I do not know whether they are intelligent, drunk or not is not a good thing.\n\nSo for three days this week, Monday-Wednesday I had jury duty out of town. Farthest I\u0019ve had to drive from home since I\u0019ve been driving. As you can expect, I was riddled with anxiety. Second day my phone battery died so I lost the navigation I rely on so much. Proceeded to be stuck in heavy traffic, in the rain, at night. Wasn\u0019t fun. Freaked out, got lost, by luck alone I made it back home a good hour after I would\u0019ve.\n\nNext day. Driving is fine, get home and have some seafood after being picked up by family. Altogether a good evening.\n\nThen the next fucking day I get in a crash on a route I\u0019ve taken thousands of times, on the same section of road my dad got rear-ended on with me and my little sister in the car.

      "text": "If you dont know what technicals are, they are basically a Toyota Hilux single cab pick up truck with a DSHK HMG bolted on a swiveling pintle to the truck bed. Ever since the Toyota war between Chad and Libya more or less pioneered the technical, every conflict ever since including Ukraine and Myanmar has been using the \"light\" (in military terms, but very heavy in civilian terms) vehicles and light weaponry as a very effective low cost tactic of fighting asymmetrical warfare.\n\nEven lighter vehicles have been employed in combat roles, WW2 had motorcycles with sidecar mounted machine guns, today's insurgencies commonly use motorcycle technicals with rpk's mounted on them. I thought based on that, why couldn't we do the same with bicycles and ebikes?\n\nBicycle mounted infantry had been a relatively common tactic from 1890-1910, the Nazis confiscated bicycles from occupied territories to serve as transport vehicles for their armed forces, and in the modern age with cargo ebikes being able to carry an adult passenger and a total mass of 250+ kg, I don't see why something like the [Propel Urban Arrow](https://propelbikes.com/product/urban-arrow-family-cargo/) or any analog or electric bakfiet couldn't have a pintle mounted machine gun in the front cargo basket or otherwise be used as a patrol / logistics vehicle, especially in places where full sized automobiles and trucks are too big to fit or otherwise are inadvisable.\n\nWhile I am aware the Ukrainian ebikes seen in [this article](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html) are more like Surrons and e motorcycles, the same concepts of micromobility in combat still apply to lighter ebikes imo. They dont use gasoline, they are quiet and far less detectable via sound and thermal signature, the fact that they are smaller than cars means they are smaller targets and take up less space, they can be recharged by the electrical grid assuming its still running in the area of operations, and even with dead batteries, they carry more cargo at a faster speed than personnel on foot.\n\nThis is definitely an idea i would say most of the pro 2nd crowd in the USA is completely overlooking in their blind support for rolling coal and lifted trucks.",

      "title": "Putting highways in tunnels is a band-aid. Cars are the root of the problem.",
      "text": "Cars suck. They\u0019re smelly and noisy. Ideally, we want them to be *out* of city-centers.\n\nThere have been a [few recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/vbf2dz/so_near_and_yet_so_far/) on this sub which suggested that cities should move car traffic underground and redevelop the surface to create spaces like the Rose Kennedy Greenway in Boston.\n\nThe resulting greenway is Nice\", so on the \"surface\", this seems like a pretty good idea, right? (pun intended).\n\nUndoubtedly, Elon Musk\u0019s Tesla Tunnels have contributed to this idea\u0019s popularity, but, like everything else from Papa Musk, it\u0019s actually not that great when you apply critical thinking.\n\nLet\u0019s look at the [Big Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig), what it accomplished, and how much it actually cost.\n\nThe Big Dig has been estimated to have a total cost of **\\~$22 Billion**\n\n\u001cIn total, the project built 161 lane-miles of highway, about half in tunnels, and four major highway interchanges\u001d\n\nThe money was not just spent building tunnels, it was also spent demolishing the existing elevated highway and creating the Rose Kennedy Greenway. It also includes many expenses that are not directly involved with \u001c*just digging a tunnel\u001d*, such as design work by an engineering firm, eminent domain to obtain the required land rights, moving existing infrastructure out of the tunnel path (i.e. water mains and sewage lines), having a worker go out and place traffic cones for a road closure - it all factors in. Especially the expenses your average person never even considers.\n\nContrary to what Elon Musk would have you believe, it\u0019s not as simple as \u001c*just digging a tunnel*\u001d.\n\nWe\u0019ll use the Big Dig as a benchmark for the use of tunnels to replace surface highways. To this point, we must assume that, to put a highway into a tunnel, work must be done on the surface to feed traffic into the tunnel. This might result in the creation of new surface lanes.\n\nThe Big Dig had mistakes that ran up the budget. We *can* say that we\u0019ve learned from those mistakes and won\u0019t repeat them, but there will be new mistakes, there will be lawsuits (there always are). There will be unpredictable situations that pop up during construction that cause delays and work stoppage.\n\nFor example, suppose that during the process of digging a tunnel, it is discovered that the geological conditions in a certain spot will cause the tunnel to eventually collapse.\n\n* Option 1, the tunnel can be redirected around the problem area.\n* Option 2, additional excavation and reinforcement can allow the tunnel to be placed in the original spot.\n\nBoth solutions cause unplanned expenses and delays.\n\nFurthermore, different regions have different conditions. In the southern US, a high concentration of clay in the soil causes excavation to be more expensive, structures below-grade must be reinforced against hydrostatic pressure, and extensive pumping &amp; draining must be installed. On the US west coast, earthquakes are a considerable risk. Tunnels require additional reinforcement to avoid being sheared during lateral movement from an earthquake (causing the tunnel to be cut off from the surface).\n\nWhile tunnels *may* be built at a lower cost in ideal regions (Midwest, Great Plains), other regions may see higher costs for tunnels. We also have to account for future inflation. Even if we could do the Big Dig again for \u001cless\u001d than $22bn, inflation might eat up our \u001csavings\u001d before the project is complete.\n\nUltimately, we can set the Big Dig as a per-lane-mile benchmark upon which the cost of putting lanes underground (in any given area) averages out.\n\nPer Lane-Mile: If you have a 1-Mile long tunnel with two lanes of roadway in it, you have 2 Lane-Miles\n\nThe Big Dig resulted in 80 lane-miles in tunnels. It cost $22 Billion\n\nThe cost per Lane-Mile is $275,000,000\n\nNow let\u0019s apply this on a broader scale. Let\u0019s assume that a random metro area in the US wants to bury some urban highways (or other arterial roads) and create surface greenways in the land footprint of the current highways.\n\nFor the sake of the argument, let\u0019s assume a metro area wants to create 200 lane-miles in tunnels in/around their downtown, and redevelop the surface space into greenway.\n\nThis comes to a cost of **$55,000,000,000 (Fifty Five Billion Dollars)** for this ONE metro area.\n\nWhat do they really gain?\n\nBoston tried it and it didn't solve their car-dependence. Sure, it made downtown Boston a much more pleasant place, but it continued to enable people to live far away and drive. Ultimately, those cars come back up to the surface when they get off the highway, and there they are polluting the city with exhaust and noise.\n\nSo for $55 Billion, you basically just get to hide your highways, pretty your downtown, and not much else.\n\nLet\u0019s put this in perspective. What kind of public transit could we provide for **$55 billion**?\n\nNYC has the largest municipal bus fleet in the US: \u001cIts fleet of 5,725 buses is the largest municipal bus fleet in the United States and operates 24/7.\u001d It also serves some 14,000 bus stops.\n\n**For $55 Billion, instead of burying their highways, this** ***ONE*** **metro area could:**\n\n* Make commuter cars illegal to drive in the city (service vehicles would still be allowed with a permit).\n* Buy **30,000** fully electric busses (**$24 Billion**)\n* Build **20,000** sheltered bus stops with bathrooms, drinking fountains, and an overhead charger for the busses to use while stopped (**$1 billion**)\n* Spend **$5 Billion** reclaiming tens of thousands of unneeded lane-miles of surface-level streets and stroads (reclaimed lanes could be turned into bike lanes, sidewalks that didn\u0019t exist before, or just planted to help reduce water runoff, soak up sunlight and reduce heat).\n* Have **$25 billion** left over to pay drivers and run the buses every 15 minutes (resulting in the transit system being fare-free).\n* Additionally, it would make hundreds of acres of surface parking lots obsolete and available for redevelopment.\n\nCar tunnels are just more car-infrastructure. It's just one more expense.\n\nIt'd be better to just improve public transit and take cars off the road in the first place.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big\\_Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig)\n\n[https://www.mass.gov/info-details/the-big-dig-facts-and-figures](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/the-big-dig-facts-and-figures)\n\n[https://www.liveabout.com/bus-cost-to-purchase-and-operate-2798845](https://www.liveabout.com/bus-cost-to-purchase-and-operate-2798845)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA\\_Regional\\_Bus\\_Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA_Regional_Bus_Operations)\n\n[https://www.ny.com/transportation/buses/ridebuses.html](https://www.ny.com/transportation/buses/ridebuses.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: links didn't format right",

Typically there are still 1-2 parking spaces per house but these don't take up much more additional space. This mixture of developments allows for more density and a wider pallette of income groups.\n\nCommercial developments and stores are also allowed.\n\nFurthermore, larger industry is allowed and situated at the edge so no one is disturbed by it.\n\nThese businesses bring money to the town, help it prosper and keep a positive balance sheet.\n\nAlso: no HOA! Nobody can dictate how your house/garden has to look like (except zoning laws, of course) and additionally new developments aren't carried out by large corporations so there are no neighbourhoods made completely out of similar looking houses.\n\n\n\n2) infrastructure\n\nThere is regular bus service from 5:30 to 23:30 on weekdays and from 00:00 to 3:30 / 5:30 to 00:00 on weekends.\n\n-&gt; Connections to the rest of the country are very good, meaning I can get away 80 km from home in an hour just by public transit.\n\n*I do need to add though that transit is way to expensive here which is one major drawback\n\nFurthermore, residential streets are narrow and don't allow more than 30km/h. The main road has two lanes, one for each direction and is capped at 50km/h. So you can comfortably cycle through the town in in residential streets (or one the main road, even though it's less pleasant) and walk on the continuous sidewalk. These things allow people to live without a car, reduce sprawling as less land is zoned for roads or parking.\n\n\n\n3) small businesses\n\nSmaller services such as hairdressers don't require a large customer base and are thus ideal for serving your village or maybe additionally your neighbour village. It's completely possible to run a business in your home or use part of your property for business.\n\n \n\n4) financing\n\nThere is no large town here that could support the suburbs. Thus single-family developments have to be paid for and aren't carried by subsidies. This isn't that tragic though as most middle class citizens can afford multi- or single family homes - their cost is reduced by not being dependent on a car and not being far away from everything else.\n\nIf you can't afford that you can still rent an apartment!\n\n\n\nSo, according to some people this place here should be an overdense shithole? Not at all, it's peaceful, spacious and there are a lot of green spaces.\n\nAll in all, I like how we do things here. Reducing car dependency leads to more flexibility in life, more prosperity and more communal, liveable places and I hope this way of building towns becomes commonplace everywhere.",

I said i don't feel people that own them are inherently better, some people buy them for status symbols, I know they take up energy and batteries have mined lithium.  I said better planning of cities and development where less people have to use cars and getting less cars on the road is a more important goal.  It could even make it better for those who want to drive and emergency vehicles if there is less traffic.\n\nStill I get most people currently in the US have to deal with a reality where you have to drive.  I'm not the one judging someone for having a car, electric or not, i don't know their situation.  And the state of our electric grid is not an individual person's fault even if we can make the choice to use less energy.  I overheat easy and I live in Florida, I'm using AC.  I like that options for different kind of vehicles exist, we need to look at all options even if i don't think it is THE solution and that ultimately we need less cars.  And that i don't like the idea that if you can't be perfect it is not worth doing something at all. \n\nBoth of my comments got a laugh react from them.  \n\nI can't explain how much it hurts to try so hard to be reasonable and understanding and get laugh reacts.  People can be assholes and carbrain society is just one thing making it worse.  But it really hurts and i don't think any people anywhere else will care about my feelings from this exchange.",

      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here.

      "text": "From **Quartz**: [Trump's running mate J.D. Vance wants tax rebates for gas cars instead of EVs](https://qz.com/jd-vance-trump-gas-car-rebates-evs-1851594703)\n\n&gt;*As recently as 2020 Vance was seen praising solar energy and begged for a \u001cclean energy future\u001d to cure the \u001cclimate problem in our society.\u001d When it became clear to him that he\u0019d need Donald Trump\u0019s endorsement to win the Ohio senate race, he began a dramatic shift his positions on climate denialism and fossil fuels. This bill proved to Trump that Vance would kiss the ring in exchange for power, killing the old Vance to grow a new one in his image.*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*The Drive American Act seeks to gut the Biden administration\u0019s electric vehicle tax rebate program, with the first half of the bill undoing the program altogether. In the latter half of the bill, Vance proposes that American taxpayers follow him into a ridiculously circular logic that would instead place up to a $7,500 rebate on all new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, trucks, and SUVs. Vehicles with larger payloads and more seats would be eligible for more of the incentive. In order to take advantage of this, you\u0019d need to live in a household making less than $300,000, and the vehicle could not exceed $80,00o. Both \u001climits\u001d are well north of average.* ",

      "text": "Not sure if this has been posted yet.. couldn't find it anyways - but we got featured in Carbrain monthly! Be sure to check out the comments section for some great nuanced takes from the car persons. (/s)\n\n[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you imagine your life without a car or a truck? Do you see yourself biking to work or taking the bus every single day? Are you ready to carry groceries and supplies like in the old days? Well, this is what some people are dreaming of. We\u0019re not talking about 100, 1,000, or 10,000 people. No, there are over 217,000 supporters of the anti-car movement! It\u0019s worth understanding what they want, since these ideas tend to spread like wildfire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to a subreddit that has a very explicit name, people that are in favor of banning cars are not looking to make emergency vehicles disappear, they don\u0019t want to disrupt the supply chains dependent on trucks, and don\u0019t look at rural communities to make their plan happen. They also underline that the initiative isn\u0019t political and doesn\u0019t adhere to any set of \u001cleft\u001d or \u001cright\u001d values and beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What these guys and gals wish is to make everyone aware of the cost that we must all support because cars became so important for almost anything we do. This is clearer now that we\u0019ve all gradually returned to normal office hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-car community essentially agrees that building the roads and the needed utilities creates \u001can unwanted economic burden on communities\u001d that has proven to be costly everywhere, especially when you look at the yearly amount of dollars spent on maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they say this won\u0019t stop with the switch to all-electric and self-driving cars, since charging and moving around without human control will almost certainly guarantee the number of vehicles won\u0019t come down, and more money will be needed for charging and resting spots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Not enough room for everyone**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People also think cities give too much space to cars, parking, and gas or charging stations. They want more parks, schools, homes, and businesses instead of vehicles in populated urban areas. Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand, which translates into more cars everywhere if roads are widened and parking spots are created.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These online activists also underline that not everyone can simply buy and drive a vehicle. They say children, teenagers, impoverished parents and adults, and those unable to drive suffer a lot in \u001ccar-centric cities.\u001d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-car movement supporters also argue motor vehicles are dangerous. Occupants may benefit from increased levels of protection as automotive technology evolves and companies create new materials that are lighter, stronger, yet dissipate impact energy in a very efficient way, but those that are not in a car might not survive an impact with one \u0013 something that everybody knows since childhood. But these people insist exercising any *\u001cform of car-free liberty\u001d* is automatically linked to constant threat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They also say cars are nurturing isolation, since people don\u0019t meet so often to have a chat on a sidewalk. You may be inclined to bring up car communities and events, but keep in mind activists are only referring to city life. Urban dwellers might enjoy some more space for weekend activities or just walk to and from work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A change must happen, but not like this**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, the idea to ban cars remains a discussion on [a popular forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/). But the number of people that agree with this idea is frightening. It\u0019s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much, but giving up on fossil fuels and designing better cities might just do the trick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A change is clearly needed, but it can\u0019t happen without motor vehicles. They are an integral part of the U.S. (and the world) and of a major industry, while some certain models create entire communities, and even inspire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All in all, banning cars from public roads and crowded cities might be applicable in specific cases or in some locations, but the U.S. is not ready in any way, shape, or form to give up entirely on motor vehicles. New York City is already struggling with keeping traffic under control after they\u0019ve made more space for bicycles and buses. People have various needs when it comes to reaching different destinations, and we can\u0019t take the comfort of knowing they can go everywhere they need at any given time without offering a public infrastructure that\u0019s working continuously and without delays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle, be it a battery-electric or a fuel-cell (hydrogen) one.",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That\u0019s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.\u001d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/air-pollution-in-nsw-causes-603-premature-deaths-and-costs-48bn-a-year-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\n**The NSW Clean Air Strategy 2021-2030**\n\n\nDoes address cars and trucks with:\n\n*Zero Emissions Bus Transition Strategy* to transition to electric battery buses and hydrogen fuel cell technology. \n\n*Walking and Cycling Program*  to create cycling and walking connections/parths around Sydney.\n\n *NSW Electric Vehicle Strategy* to increase electric vehicle use through government rebates and building charges.",

I don't want a new, bigger car right now. \n\nI'm having my first baby, and have been told multiple times that that means I absolutely need an SUV. A few reasons:\n- bending over to put the car seat in will hurt your back (I'm short - reaching and climbing into a tall car isn't exactly comfortable either) \n- it's safer (not if it has blind spots the size of a small country)\n- it'll fit all the gear better (maybe legit, idk but I need to figure that out on my own. I'd rather carry less gear anyways) \n\nI've told people that I'm saving up for an electric car, but apparently that's unsafe because \"what if the baby needs to go to the hospital and there's a power outage and the car battery is dead?\" Like omg, that's not going to happen all at once. \n\nI guess everyone is just really, really anxious about kids, and buying things that are marketed as \"safe\" can be soothing. I wish that our carbrained society didn't have this fixation - babies are expensive and wasteful enough without requiring a $40k gas guzzling carriage.\n\nInfo: I'm in Canada.

But some modern vehicles can instead smash through these guardrails, new research demonstrates, sending their passengers hurtling toward a ditch, cliff, or whatever is on the other side. The problem is that thousands of miles of guardrails installed alongside American highways were designed decades ago, when vehicles were much lighter than the behemoths that increasingly dominate the U.S. car market. And cars are only getting heavier: Bulkier electrified versions of big cars are poised to arrive in the years ahead. The risk of huge vehicles tearing through guardrails is yet another reason to expect American car bloat to augur an expensive, and dangerous, roadway future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This rhetoric is designed to kill all movement and political inspiration towards mass transit and a concerted transformation of how we move around our local space and the world at large. \n\nThey fight only to preserve auto manufacturers and car oriented infrastructure by shaming those who want an end to cars; they find it totally acceptable to abandon the radical demands for an evolution in movement for the \"cars will always exist, let's just make the best of it\" cop out garbage.\n\nBeyond climate degredation, cars fucking suck for myriad other reasons, the most profound of which is that they fucking kill tens of thousands of people a year in the US alone. Electric vehicles will still make our lives worse, prevent our cities and suburbs and villages from changing and connecting, send us to the hospital and the grave even, and for what? A pitiful reduction in carbon emissions that won't put us anywhere near the reductions we need to save the world as we know it? The preservation and proliferation of the private capital of auto manufacturers, which will continue to erode our lives and living spaces for its own gain? All Because some quasi auto industry shills had the gal to convince people around the world, who wanted REAL change, that cars (or personal vehicles, if you're reading this and really want to get pedantic about it) were just \"always going to exist\"? They fucking won't, and in time people will look back to this era of history and see cars as they are now with horror and perplexity, the same way we now regard the use of leeches to treat disease. No one could not possibly be groveling harder for corporate and private capitalist supremacy, the inherent political enemy of public transit and public well being. \n\nRadical voices might not be a majority, but it takes radical voices to inspire into the social imagination a new way of thinking about the world, to open the minds of the majority to the idea that our lives can exist completely without personal vehicles, that anywhere humans build settlement CAN be connected to reliable public transit, and that in such a world, our lives can be so much better. Electric vehicles won't, in even beyond-possible scenarios of success, save us from climate catastrophe. A fully mobilized transition to mass transit could actually give us a shot at avoiding catastrophe. To make this possible, it must first be imagined, it must be believed, and this is a perfect space to contribute to that imagination, but it's terribly impeded from happening when so many car brains brigade any given thread with their fresh-from-the-shit-spigot platitudes commanding that everyone get in line with the neo-liberal agenda. \n\n\nThis place is called Fuck Cars, and I say that we all get on board with the idea that Fuck Cars means Fuck ALL Cars",

      "text": "Since their start, Tyre Extinguishers has often appeared in this sub, drawing praise and criticism. Not everyone in this sub appreciates deflating tyres of SUVs to make a point.\n\nAs a result, all TX posts see a flood of similar comments opposing their actions. Unfortunately, many arguments are based on misunderstanding what TX actually is and does or what direct action entails.\n\nWhile obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it would be a shame if we kept running around and regurgitating the same talking points. So, to help the discussion move along, here's a list of commonly used thoughts on why TX sucks, with a short reaction.\n\n\\---\n\n* **This will only aggravate SUV drivers and turn them against your cause.**  \nEverything you do to prevent people from driving more and larger SUVs will turn SUV drivers against you. To quote a wise man or woman: 'If a protest doesn't inconvenience, it's not a protest; it's a picnic.' TX is not looking to make friends with drivers. They want unnecessary SUVs off the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is dangerous. Letting people drive around with deflated tyres is incredibly irresponsible.**  \nTX leaves a leaflet on the windshield to alert drivers that their tyres are deflated. That, combined with possible warning lights in the car and the fact that any driver will quickly notice a flat tyre, means the real chance of someone driving off with their flat tyre is negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **So now a diesel-powered tow truck has to make extra trips to get the SUV back on the road? I'm suddenly pretending to be hyper-focused on emissions, and this seems counter-productive.**  \nThe goal of deflating tyres is not to reduce the number of trips of that particular vehicle. Instead, TX is after the large-scale systemic change by spreading its message far and wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Some people live where a car is the only option, you know?**  \nThen TX will be no problem. They clearly state they only operate in urban environments. So nobody will have their tyres deflated in the suburbs or rural areas. Not by TX, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is not an effective way to spread your message.**  \nLiterally, hundreds and hundreds of news articles from all over the world, including some really nuanced background stories in some of the most prominent outlets, beg to differ. TX has been remarkably effective in spreading its anti-SUV arguments to the general audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Imagine being a single mother with three jobs/a poor worker just trying to get by and finding your tyres deflated, with no money to call roadside service and now you lose your job and whaa-whaa!**  \nTX clearly states they target posh vehicles in upscale neighbourhoods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **What if people need to haul stuff for their work? Or need a large vehicle to store their wheelchair?**  \nTX clearly states they don't target vehicles clearly marked as for work or for disabled or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This will do nothing to reduce the number of cars on the road.**  \nTX clearly states they are against SUVs and large 4x4s in urban area's. They are unnecessarily dangerous and polluting. TX are not anti-car per se.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Why target innocent individuals? They should target oil companies/car manufacturers/car dealers/politicians instead!**  \nPlease look at this handy '[Moderates guide to doing absolutely nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/y30j3q/based_on_actual_conversations_on_this_sub/)' made especially for you.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **We support slashing tyres now?**  \nTX doesn't slash tyres. They deflate them. Pump 'em back up, and SUVs are back on the road; message sent, no damage done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I've thought up a scenario where someone who doesn't deserve it is still terribly inconvenienced by their flat tyre. But I bet you haven't considered that, huh?!**  \nSince around 35 million SUVs were sold in 2021 alone (roughly 45 per cent of all cars sold), and TX claims to have deflated 10,000 vehicles in just over half a year, that scenario is implausible.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I heard they deflate the tyres of eSUVs and hybrids as well, proving my theory that they are not environmentalists, just hooligans.**  \nElectric or hybrid SUVs are still unsafe and, in many cases, unnecessary. Furthermore, tailpipe emissions are not the only pollution. Besides the large carbon footprint these enormous cars have, tyre wear causes tremendous particle pollution. eSUVS are typically heavier and have more torque, causing more strain on tyres and thus polluting more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I understand their point, but I am against touching people's personal stuff.**  \nFair enough. But remember that SUVs are more dangerous for those not inside that vehicle, take up more public space and emit more pollution for you to breathe in. They mess with you personally every day, and drivers seem to either not know or not care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **If you want to get your point across, why not attend a protest? Why not take up a role in your local government? Why not do this or that?**  \nAll of those things can exist together. Disruptive direct action is not a substitute for protesting or actively shaping policy. It's an addition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **There are better ways to protest.**  \nPlease leave them in the comments so we can learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTX have [a website](https://www.tyreextinguishers.com/) where you can read what they do and why they do it. Makes of lot of comments in this sub redundant.",

      "text": "And all of this under a post showing how the US lost much of its train network through the decades, ironically enough. Seriously where do people get this idea and how do we convince people that it's not a conspiracy? \n\nThe question is kind of rhetorical as many people making such claims have per-confirmed beliefs which say otherwise (which automatically means they're right to them despite not posting any sources) and will not listen to reason no matter how sound it is.\n\nYou're telling me that car manufacturers making bigger and bigger vehicles (US ones in particular as this wasn't the norm in the world) for seemingly no reason, suddenly saying how everyone needs all of that \"utility and size\" and phasing out smaller, older cars and their parts isn't them manipulating the market and making people pay more for more fuel inefficient, dangerous vehicles. (And I fucking love how apparently the entire US suddenly lives in a secluded part of the country in some log cabin with no electricity, with having to drive 50 miles through ice and snow, and they say they all need their trucks, riiiiiiiight)\n\n  \nYou're telling me they didn't lobby politicians to build more roads and highways, often bulldozing poor, POC neighbourhoods which were areas of dense housing, and if it wasn't that it was bulldozed to construct bunch of samey looking single family homes (with car garages ofc).\n\nYou're telling me, that, back when cars were first introduced en masse, they caused a bunch of crashes but didn't try to victim blame pedestrians so they can make roads more friendly for cars. Yeah a world that was so used to walking on roads were all very happy suddenly that roads were excluded from walking on said roads, totally.\n\nYou're telling me that, despite the US being very similar to the rest of the world before cars and that almost every town and village had some rail connecting them to larger cities, it's just that rail fell out of favour and no one was using it anymore suddenly (because buying cars worth thousands was apparently a very enticing financial decision), so that's why rail closed down has got nothing to do with the auto industry.\n\nYou're also telling me that it's not the autoindustry's fault that public transit, dense housing, better cycling infrastructure and such faces MASSIVE backlash and protests from people who they totally didn't carwash? (Reminder, Elon Musk admitted to sabotaging the Californian High Speed Rail project)\n\nLet's also not mention other dumb shit which the auto industry totally didn't try to play down and play dumb... Like adding lead to fuel, ignoring warnings and its sideffects for... decades... \n\nEven if all of this was just a huge coincidence (it absolutely wasn't), then it's the dumbest, most unfortunate and selfish (and in some conscious decisions, extremely vile and racist ) set of circumstances the US (and other parts of the world) got themselves into.\n\nSo, what the fuck? How do you even keep up with these mental gymnastics?

It ended production of the eUp (the electric version of the Up) last year. We urgently need legislation that limits the size of cars. It's ridiculous that they are ending sales of these sorts of cars to force people into buying more expensive, larger and dangerous models.\n\nWhen I moved to the UK from the Middle East, I went from driving a LWB Mitsubishi Shogun to an Up. Sure it was underpowered, but I absolutely loved it. Parking went from being a chore to being almost fun.\n\nWe absolutely should be looking to reduce the number of cars in our cities and towns, but these are precisely the types of cars that should be left at the end of that purge; not the massive wankpanzers these companies seem insistent on selling.",

      "text": "I've never ridden an electric bike. But I'm familiar with modern battery and motor tech, and how far it has come in the past several years. An E-bike allows you to traverse great distances at speeds similar or greater than the average speed of a car stuck in traffic. You're outside, getting fresh air, and getting a bit of exercise too. If the battery runs out or the motor fails, you just pedal, and can easily maintain a running/jogging speed with the same effort it takes to walk. You can park it pretty much anywhere. They're basically free to operate compared to a car, new tires for an E-bike might be 100 bucks tops, meanwhile my tiny miata was 400 for the cheapest all season tires I could find. Not to mention the lack of oil changes or other maintenance that comes with a large internal combustion engine. The infrastructure for an E-bike is cheap and easy to maintain, too. And, of course, the almost complete lack of pollution caused by manufacturing and operating one. I have no idea why E-bikes aren't more popular, aside from areas with insufficient infrastructure to support them. I guess most people still see them as overpriced toys.\n\nEdit: In case it isn't obvious, It's gonna depend on your use case. If you commute half a mile and have to deal with stairs, a regular bike is better. If you live in an area with no bike paths, a motorcycle or scooter might be better. I'm glad I've spurred so much conversation on the topic!",

One recent study cited in the paper found that the only path to meaningful emissions reduction that still allowed for VMT growth required both 80 percent of the vehicle fleet to be electrified by 2050, and the total decarbonization of the electrical grid \u0014 and even then, it just barely squeaked in under the line. Meanwhile, experts estimate that only 30 percent of cars will have batteries by midcentury.\n\n&gt;Or, as the report authors put it bluntly: \"The U.S. will not be able to decarbonize the transportation sector by midcentury without addressing increased demand.\" \n\n&gt;That harsh reality was also underscored in more subtle ways throughout the report, which routinely placed policies that support biking, walking, transit, and other non-automotive modes at the top of its various lists of decarbonization strategies.\n\n&gt;Specifically, DOT says the agency and all of its partners in government will need to \"increase convenience\" by decreasing the distance Americans need to travel to key destinations (and the safety they can expect along the journey), as well as \"improving efficiency\" by supporting mass transportation and better freight strategies.\n\n&gt;\"Increasing clean options\" like electric vehicles was the third item on its list. \n\n(editorial continues)\n\nChart: https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2024/07/AEO-chart.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75\n\n[https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change)\n\nFound the post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/1efhtm9/usdot_warns_congress_that_americans_need_to_drive/ (do not vote if you're not a subscriber there)",

(For instance, in the obsession with electric vehicles as this mythical solution to climate change, which doesn't question the underlying destructive, unsustainable system of infrastructure behind reliance on personal vehicles for transportation.)\n\nJoining this sub has been the first time in my life I\u0019ve felt like I wasn\u0019t crazy for not wanting or believing in car-culture, and the first time I\u0019ve felt like there are others out there who question the cult of the car and value accessibility and public transit as equitable alternatives. \n\nI hope this sub can grow in visibility and perhaps generate resources for car-free alternatives in policy and life. \n\nFuck cars.",

      "text": "So as the title suggests I recently broke my ankle in a longboarding accident (stupid I know). It's my right foot so I can no longer drive which means I am immediately isolated. I can rely on DoorDash/uber and some people have been nice enough to offer rides around but still the loss of autonomy is kind of depressing. It's annoying that pro-car people always insist that cars are better for the disabled. Yeah, I am sure for some people with disabilities car centric society is a plus, but I think it harms just as many people as it helps. Blind people for example are harmed by car centric society. Not to mention the fact that even if someone's mobility is inhibited, driving from point a to point b does not solve the fact that they still cannot easily get around. Walking is still required in almost all aspects of car-centric society with the exception of drivethrus. You have to walk form the parking lot to the store. For example, if someone was paralyzed and needed an electric wheelchair, they need specialized van to transport their wheelchair and someone to drive for them if they cannot, whereas if they lived in a walkable neighborhood, they could simply use the electric wheelchair to get around. The addition of the vehicle is a hinderance not a benefit to these people. \n\nIf I lived in a place that was more walkable, I could take my crutches/scooter and at least go to a coffee shop or something to get some fresh air but instead I am shelled up in a suburban apartment and have to pay $21+ for an Uber to get anywhere. Instead of the disabled being integrated in modern society, car-centric infrastructure kind of shoves them to the wayside if they cannot drive, Especially if you are low income and unable to afford living in a walkable area.

      "text": "For some backstory, I live in the state of Florida which often has flooding, hurricanes, similar things which require evacuation from an area. \n\nWhen I\u0019m discussing car dependency and car based infrastructure with my family, my mom points out often that since we live in a state that requires evacuation it\u0019s better to be car dependent so that we can leave faster, especially so considering we live on the coast so we are much more prone to the natural disasters.\n\nShe uses this argument to also show that combustion vehicles are better than electric vehicles because it takes longer to charge an electric vehicle. This point is really dumb though because you can charge your EV over night at your home and you\u0019re probably much more likely to have more range with an EV at any given time, compared to a combustion car. Also, EVs don\u0019t use much power while idling in traffic (which would probably be the case if there is an emergency and EVERYONE is trying to leave)\n\nBack to the original point, what would places like, for example, the Netherlands, New York City, I guess some places in California, etc do if there is a disaster and they need to evacuate? Given that many of those evacuating do not have access to a vehicle.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the responses! Also, no, this is not something I believe, it was a point my mom made and I wanted to find a refutation. You know how these people are, they find one thing and stick to it as the whole argument despite there being 50 counter arguments. (Clarifying because I got two really rude messages lol)",

      "title": "It's a shame that many National Parks in North American are only (reliably) accessible by cars",
      "text": "One of the great ironies of National Parks in North America, namely in Canada and the US is that they're only reliably accessible by personal automobile. I shouldn't have to tell you how terrible cars are for animals and the environment. There's the direct consequences like collisions (roadkill), road noise, tire particles, constant traffic, habitat loss resulting from just how much space cars, roads, highways, and parking lots take up. \n\nCars kill thousands of people each year, and millions of animals, if it's unsafe for people to cross a highway, it's definitely unsafe for animals to cross. Even though some of the highways crossing through forests have these wildlife crossing bridges, these bridges wouldn't have to exist if it weren't for cars and highways cutting the forest in half!\n\n[This wouldn't need to exist if it weren't for cars!](https://preview.redd.it/n58xou3vzjad1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e25d71d8079d66cd8829efa3acb3e9a7e4d53a4)\n\nThen there's the indirect consequences like air pollution both local and global, cars encouraging sprawling suburbs, mining and extracting resources like oil, metal, etc for the production and maintenance of cars, imperialism, invasions, and wars for said resources \\*cough\\* \\*cough\\* US invasion of Iraq, exploitative labor practices and literal child slaves for lithium mining for battery electrics cars! I could go on about how terrible cars are both physically, environmentally, and socially, but I'll focus on the irony on how many National Parks are only accessible by car.\n\nIt's ironic how the only way to \"experience true nature\" is for someone to hop into a usually gas-guzzling car, drive it down a highway that cuts the forest in half, only to [mow down a rare white brown bear and her cubs in the process](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/). Needless to say, f\\*ck cars, and especially f\\*ck them if they're used to drive through a National Park. And the gall of calling these parks \"protected lands\" while allowing cars to drive through them?! If you want to protect land, prohibit cars from driving there!\n\nOne of the biggest threats facing animals in natural areas isn't human hunters, poachers, or invasive species, but cars! Cars both directly and indirectly are the biggest killers of animals, and it's a shame that most National Parks are only accessible by cars, the biggest threat to animals.\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nI'm not saying that there shouldn't be parks for people to visit as people just walking on trails and such do not greatly disturb wildlife. However, driving there in a car shouldn't be the only option if an option at all. \n\nWhile there are unfortunately collisions between trains on ground level tracks and animals, the number of \"roadkill\" is significantly lower than with cars and measures can be taken to prevent this. As to why train collisions with animals are lower? Firstly, railway tracks do not take up a lot of space compared to a highway. All you need for a railway to be efficient is a double track, and even with larger North American loading gauges, at most all you need is about 7.5 meters width, the equivalent of two highways lanes (correct me if I'm wrong about North American train loading gauges).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kemivdb9ckad1.jpg?width=509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ec593632f618091cb65e04c75c7076bc78b5e8\n\nSecondly, even a frequent railway line with trains every ten minutes is nowhere near the constant, never-ending traffic of a highway. With trains every ten minutes or longer, it allows for animals to cross.\n\nAnd thirdly, it seems like animals are just better adapted around trains than with cars. Rather than worrying about dozens of cars when trying to cross a highway, they only have to deal with one train on tracks that take up less space, meaning there's lower risk when crossing. We've all seen birds and such hang out around train tracks without issue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbdkl9liakad1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b99d181006d8cbcf13c7ee5e21f2c7e0c257e46\n\nNow, in the unfortunately [story with the rare white brown bear](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/), if I read the article correctly, the mother was grazing in the ditch near the train tracks. Now when the metal wheels screeched against the rails, it startled her, I mean who wouldn't get startled by train wheels screeching, I would as trains are relatively quiet except for wheel screech. The startled mother bear unfortunately ran up from the ditch and onto the highway where she was struck and killed.\n\n\"It's the train that scared her onto the highway! If it weren't for the train, she wouldn't have gotten struck!\" A car brain would say. Keep in mind that the bear knew to stay off the train tracks, and that it was the car that made the killing blow. If the highway wasn't there and the bear did got startled, she would've gone back to the ditch and continue on grazing. Not to mention cars kill animals regardless if there's a train track nearby or not. The train didn't kill her, the cars did!\n\nNow, one way to mitigate the impacts that railways have in an forested area, at least once construction is complete is to have the tracks elevated on viaducts as it allows for the train to be fully grade separated while allowing for animals to cross underneath.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4htsj1agakad1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a6cd178cbbf672fd3d4dc89d8d9a0c5197fed3\n\nWhile all human activity does impact wildlife, having elevated railways probably has the lowest impact as once construction is complete, it doesn't cut the forest in half like a surface highway for the elevated tracks allows for animals to cross beneath it safely without having to worry about getting struck.\n\nIt's a shame that most National Parks in North America are only accessible by car, the worst mode of transport for animals' wellbeing due to how many animals cars kill. To preserve our National Parks, we have to restrict cars from entering them due to said negative effects. At best, have elevate trains to them. At the bear minimum, use buses that can take a good 50-100 cars off the road.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yko469ebbkad1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc60d6a7661254b040e5f360fed1bae291a08283\n\nBy limiting and/or prohibiting cars from driving through National Parks can we preserve and truly enjoy the wonders of the natural world.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uhyaujlbkad1.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c06d21a44a3e5a9f173e3781fe668a9fa32b7ba\n\n",

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

      "text": "Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:\n\n**\u001cMy emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d**\n\nThis is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth\u0019s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t afford an electric car.\u001d**\n\nNo one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There\u0019s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\u001d**\n\nYou *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dDriving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nCommute times should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cThere\u0019s no infrastructure to bike where I live.\u001d**\n\nAny road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThe infrastructure isn\u0019t ready yet.\u001d**\n\nWe don\u0019t have time: not only is our planet\u0019s climate destabilizing, it\u0019s destabilizing quickly. We can\u0019t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it\u0019s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.\n\n**\u001cMy workplace is out of reach of biking distance.\u001d**\n\nConsider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can\u0019t, then consider finding another job that\u0019s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn\u0019t be the priority when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI\u0019m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.\u001d**\n\nUnless you\u0019re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t carry my groceries on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThere\u0019s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t ride a bike in the cold.\u001d**\n\nWear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cNot everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThen go for an adult tricycle instead. Don\u0019t set that option aside so quickly when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThere wouldn\u0019t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.\u001d**\n\nIf more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet\u0019s climate from destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t like waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nBring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI don\u0019t like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d**\n\nComfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dHow can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\u001d**\n\nAre you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?\n\n**\u001dYour use of a device that\u0019s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we\u0019re focusing on.\n\n**\u001d[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.\n\nThe bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren\u0019t insignificant at all. You can\u0019t shift the blame on \u001ccorporations\u001d or \u001cinfrastructure\u001d when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.\n\nEDITS:\n\nIt turns out r/fuckcars has *way* more car apologists hiding among its members than one would expect!\n\nDrinking game!

      "text": "So I go to a big university in Mississippi, USA (Not a good start, but it is where I am). Here they have all \"sharrows\" instead of complete dedicated bike lanes. On campus, they had blocked off a lot of the students from driving on the roads on campus, but there are still campus specific vehicles that traverse the area, so they should be trained to watch out for bicycles, pedestrians, and electric push scooters (which are super prevalent on campus). Well, while students were crossing at the cross walk, all the cars had stopped and it was a straight road with a curb, so no one should be turning. So I decide to cut in front on the right between the curb and 2 cars in front of me because they were at a stop and I cannot hurt anyone harshly on my bicycle. When I passed the cars, the cops (one of the cars) had come up to me once I had parked in front of my building and told me that \"You should not be passing because if we turned and hit you, it would be your fault.\" Mind you, this is supposed to be a 10 MPH or less zone.\r  \n1.)

Motorcycles are not inherently death machines. The other motorists on the roads make them death machines. \n\nI feel as though the motorcyclist is the ally of the pedestrian. We both want to see safer roads with smaller more modest vehicles. \n\nMotorcycles take up less parking space and could be quite useful for expanding transit wells (the ridership pool around a transit stop) beyond the time/distance cap of E-bikes. \n\nBtw e-bikes are great, But there are limitations on their top speed. Increasing that top speed would typically require a motorcycle license anyway. Thus there is a hard limit for how far away from a transit stop you could live with a Bike governed to 25 miles an hour (assuming time constraints). \n\nA proper motorcycle; electric or otherwise could go much further in the same amount of time. When it gets to the transit stop it would not take up as much space as a four wheeled monster. \n\nA future in which more people trade in their cars for motorcycles and use them to get to the nearest transit stop quicker could boost ridership across the board. \n\nMotorcycles could easily be a stopgap measure for those who cannot afford to be within walking or biking distance of transit.\n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "Hopefully everyone can read it because it\u0019s a gift article. Archived link [here](https://archive.ph/2024.03.29-163831/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/climate/epa-trucks-emissions-regulation.html) if not. \n\nThis article is such a puff piece of half-measures by the Biden administration. From the article: \u001cThe Environmental Protection Agency projects the new rule could mean that 25 percent of new long-haul trucks, the heaviest on the road, and 40 percent of medium-size trucks, like box trucks and landscaping vehicles, could be *nonpolluting* by 2032\u001d (emphasis added). \n\nThat\u0019s such fucking bullshit. As per usual the conversation around vehicle emissions and dangers focuses on global warming (i.e. tailpipe emissions, obviously a very prescient concern but a limited one, as I set out below) and not human health more broadly as impacted by vehicle use. Indeed, the use of the word \u001cnonpolluting\u001d in the article, as well as the frequent reference to \u001czero emissions\u001d when it comes to electric road transport, really betrays the fact that an unregulated area of vehicle pollution, brake dust and rubber particulate pollution from tires, is not talked about nearly enough. \n\nFor instance, see this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/09/tire-brake-tailpipes-emissions-pollution-cars/) (see archive [here](https://archive.ph/2023.12.18-030934/https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/09/tire-brake-tailpipes-emissions-pollution-cars/)) discussing studies in California regarding brake dust and tire rubber impact on human respiratory and heart health. From the article:\n\n\u001cIn fact, wear and tear on tires and brakes have been shown to produce increasingly more particle pollution, by mass, than car exhaust systems did in several real-world and test scenarios . . . In one study, Jung and his colleagues looked at car emission sources along two highways in Long Beach and Anaheim in January and February 2020. In Anaheim, they found brake and tires constituted 30 percent of PM 2.5, whereas exhaust emissions linked to gasoline and diesel constituted 19 percent. In Long Beach, brake and tires constituted 15 percent of PM 2.5 pollution, which was the same as pollution from gas and diesel.\u001d\n\nI just wanted to highlight this because the comments in the NYT treat this as an unreserved win. It is a win, to be sure, but it also serves to further the narrative that electric cars are the silver bullet to a problem that is much bigger than just tailpipe emissions. If we want to take a wholistic approach to our vehicle use not killing people with \u001csilent killers\u001d like respiratory illnesses and heart disease, we have to take these sources of pollution seriously. Indeed, we don\u0019t even know the full range of impact on human health from these things. The contribution of microplastics and small airborne metallic particles entering the human body is not yet fully appreciated, but the results aren\u0019t getting more encouraging with each subsequent study that\u0019s published.\n\nThis also doesn\u0019t cover issues with routing huge freight vehicles and other electric vehicles (most of which are extremely heavy compared to ICE vehicles) through crowded cities which risk human health by running pedestrians and cyclists over, contributing to worse car crashes with more deaths, and a host of other more obvious dangers caused. I\u0019ll never forget the time in the town I grew up in where a high school classmate of mine was cycling to school and got killed by a 18 wheeler just a couple blocks away from campus because the turn radius of the trailer took it into the bike lane, and in response they put up those silly plastic divider sticks and painted the lane green. \n\nThe Biden administration\u0019s supposed silver bullet answer to the dangers posed by road vehicles is endlessly frustrating. While tailpipe emissions are indeed a major issue to be concerned with, I worry that for many the road to progress ends at the moment when we arrive at widespread electric vehicle adoption. ",

      "text": "It is known that making transport faster tends only to increase the average distances and is largely self defeating. \n\nIt also increases energy cost considerably. Consider that below 30mph air resistance is negligible (discounting head winds). Mass is also increased due to the increased safety requirement, increasing losses, and damage to road surfaces is also potentially increased, especially by trucks. \n\nTo transition to a more efficient society we would need to do certain things. I have some proposals;\n\nTax cars and trucks not only by mile but multiplied by the following variables - width, other size variables, mass, unsprung weight and calculated road damage, energy efficiency, type of pollution and speed. Insurance should be integrated into this.\n\nRather than discourage short journeys, the objective should be to shorten average distances for all modes. This also makes, in the end, the car free alternative more practical as society redistributes to be more localised.\n\nTo do this an additional toll may be applied to journeys that leave certain districts, and which use highways or motorways.\n\nTaxing cars by width - the average car has just one person in it, an occupancy of around 1.2 going on memory. Most commuting could be done in tilting vehicles or narrow cars like the Renault Twizy.  *As such some lanes could be split in two.* Others can be narrowed to be more pedestrian friendly.\n\nThe most efficient speed is around 22 to 23mph. This speed increases the capacity of the road to its maximum. This speed is close to the urban speed limit for many residential roads in some parts of the world, 20mph/30kmph. Therefore, a grid of such roads could be constructed and a separate license (similar to a scooter license) may be used to give complete urban mobility. This speed also suits self driving technologies and may increase mobility to the disabled and elderly.\n\nAt this speed very light, and very efficient electric vehicles can be envisaged, maybe with 20-30 km/kWh.\n\nHybrid electric bicycles should be designed for this speed also so traffic can share such lanes. \n\nReducing distances also involves planning and organisation. Incentives to encourage hiring of local workers, and housing to go to local workers, can be envisaged. \n\nUsing the UK as an example, corporate and employee taxes (such as the employers N.I. contributions) could be lowered when hiring local workers.\n\nHousing may be sold in auctions favouring local workers first, if they fail to buy, then it may go broader. Property taxes may be lower when residents don't have cars or work locally. Exemptions may be provided to trades people and families. This should also be encouraged in the rental market.\n\nJob schemes should entail that if a local job comes up, it is advertised first to local workers. An alert system may be set up to encourage local working.\n\nHousing and jobs that would be taken by workers using public transport in the direction there is spare capacity in peak periods could also be incentivised, cheaper tickets but also incentives to the employers and housing developers to co-locate near jobs that would encourage this.",

The family on the inside of that car cannot hear any of the trucks. I can't be the only one who thinks this \"feature\" is extremely dangerous as it would prevent you from hearing anything outside your vehicle especially if someone is trying to alert you about a hazard, an emergency vehicle is trying to pass, etc.\n\nYou wouldn't wear noise-cancelling headphones while you drive, so why is noise-cancelling the entire car deemed as okay?",

      "title": "Financing the low car future - a policy discussion",
      "text": "So, there are some glorious tax raising opportunities that governments have been ignoring in relation to cars for a long time. Personally, I happen to believe in free markets as an aspirational thing but its clear that you have to apply external costs and benefits to economic choices to get good overall results and if you are fiscally on the right side of the spectrum its a bit odd that you might consider that cars would qualify for so many government bennies.\n\nI look at the opportunity cost of the resources not going where they should be and realise if they were going where they should be we would all be collectively wealthier. Not just financially, but also wealthier generally. In fact, even the car drivers would be be better off if they have nicer places to live and less time wasted.\n\nAnyway, perhaps we could discuss how, if we were elected, we might redirect funds and raise taxes in an economically viable way, preferably politically neutral, as in not to a particular ideology but just because its good economics and good for the individual as well as society.\n\nI think the problem has to be tackled from different direction. Yes, modal switch to low impact transit. Manage induced demand by focusing on shorter distances and commutes.  But also the cars that remain can be greatly improved. Many could be less than half the width, and that could mean some lanes split, which in turn means that more lanes can be turned over to something else. In the long run we know that we have to tackle both inefficiency of the transport mode but also induced demand effects.\n\nRaise taxes from inefficient activities to subsidies efficient ones - reconstruction of Americas 'interurbans'. It needs thousands of km of new track and some sort of harmonised rolling stock. We have this kind of thinking in the military, as in the JSF program. Why aren't we thinking this way about transit (well, we know why, its a rhetorical question).\n\nAt the same time you have electric buses, traffic light prioritisation opportunities, new cycle lane infrastructure to do all at once.\n\nThe planning system needs overhauling and I know that the U.S. friends think highly of mixed use planning, which is an improvement but I would caution that really you want a kind of hybrid, that starts with low impact transit networks and then strategically builds in development zones and corridors with higher densification, and the need of a strategic development authority that starts with transit schemes and can guide minimum density and compatible mixed-uses, pre-planning and providing consent for schemes that meet or exceed minimum standards. This also might involve a point scoring system and only the best schemes go to community vote. I would change taxes on land use to discourage wasteful usage, if two or more uses could have been provided from the same land, such as generating solar energy, then that should be incentivised. The cost of wasting land should be passed on and discouraged.  If a person is more efficient in their choices, they should always be economically rewarded as land is a finite resource (especially where it is needed) and there are external costs passed on to others in the economy from not making full use of it.\n\nSo here's some of my own ideas;\n\n**Taxes -  revenue sources for our Treasury**\n\nSo, first off to tax road usage by distance (road taxes by the km).  There would be some special considerations for rural and commercial users with particular needs, but generally this would apply.\n\nThen multiply this by the size and weight of the vehicle, along with other features that impact the infrastructure of parking and the width of lanes, or other external costs (does it belch fumes in urban area or make a noise disturbance, how does the vehicle design impact risks to pedestrians and cyclists).  Weight is a factor as it directly correlates to road maintenance costs, but you can refine it to include other variables known to influence this, like unsprung weight, but that's more detail than we need. We are however, just passing on costs).\n\nSales taxes on vehicles to be be based on efficiency km/kWh of the intended typical duty cycle. These taxes are based on percentiles, and automatically roll forwards. By this I mean, the top 20% most efficient might get a subsidy, the next 20% no tax, and then 20% on the next 20%, then the last two categories get massively hammered. There should be minimum targets to start with. Each vehicle class should meet a given efficiency and that gradually but predictably increased. For example electric 4/5 seat family cars for mainly urban use should weigh not more than one tonne, and be not less than 12km/kWh in urban use, maybe 10km/kWh at highway cruise. These would qualify for the electric vehicle subsidy. Below this efficiency taxes are progressively increased, and above it decreased. Then move the target to 12km/kWh for this class, then 15 etc.\n\nA commuting class vehicle that is much smaller, Twizzy sized or less should be encouraged. Free or cheap street parking would be largely converted to spaces for such sizes. These should start at 500kg tare weight, but long term this should come down to 250kg or less.. The less, the more sales subsidy.\n\nParking - parking space to be taxed, and the costs passed on in proportion to vehicle size, although rules would be modified for commercial vehicles.\n\nHouse taxes - new houses to not include large parking space, sufficient only for one small car maybe, if at all, rather a utility space for small scooters, bikes, a very small microcar. Space for larger vehicles may be rented.  Space used for cars may be taxed in the same way that, bizarrely in the UK having double glazing led to a higher council tax bracket (an example of a perverse incentive, but shows how concepts no matter how daft have never deterred tax planners in the past). Parking space used as a single use should be particularly taxed, but town planning rules should approve building of apartments and solar panels over them to reduce the tax per m\\^2 used (we reward efficiency).\n\nLand taxes - as opposed to various other kinds of taxes some of these may be better replaced with taxing on land. This could perhaps allow higher income tax free thresholds, and taxes on businesses that discourage hiring and training staff might be reduced. Whilst land that is efficiently used for a category of purpose or purposes, might be taxed less or not at all, such as agriculture that meets some minimum standards, in this case it by itself does not have the effect that other land use does in increasing travel cost/need, and a minimum area used by a business or a residence may not be taxed (an allowance). Densification should be encouraged and may qualify for a lower shared land tax rate when going above a certain standard. And on this topic, how quickly would councils / local authorities and highways agencies start to change if \\*they\\* were taxed for this land area used  in roads? How quickly would they start finding ways to use less space, sell off what they don't need, and start planning mass transit? Council funds could and should be rewarded by their efficient use of land.\n\nInsurance - like road taxes, should be paid by the mile. A good way to discourage excess usage and promote alternatives.\n\nIncentivise businesses to hire more local workers, both by registering workers work locations and residential areas and advertising swaps for more local work first to these, and also business taxes might relate to the fraction of cars used by the workforce and on parking, as mentioned.\n\n**Spending (the fun part)**\n\nAffordable housing grants, also the grant per person increases with density and proximity to a low impact transit corridor (served by bus/tram/train rapid transit with a regular service) and/or to local jobs and services with a minimum expected car free resident population (can be modelled).\n\nTrams - new ultra-light rail construction program, new interurban networks. At least 1000km/year installed. Making a big effort at getting mass down can also allow these systems to be made more '3  dimensional' as in climb up onto low cost elevated infrastructure over roads. An emphasis on low weight results in cheaper infrastructure all round, but it may also help with noise, which we want to make a big effort to nearly eliminate (manage the reputation of such schemes and increase popularity and acceptance). These would be planned in with strategic development planning corridors with special development rules/freedoms/expectations which maybe should be governed by a powerful strategic planning authority. This should ultimately though encourage local landowners to support the scheme by adding value to their land and giving them greater densification possibilities, at least in some areas.\n\nHigh speed transit to link cities better. Mix of dedicated high speed routes. Above 200mph systems might be maglex, below 200mph might be designed to link closer cities, or establish new cities between existing cities.\n\nExtensive freight rail network and expansion. This can also support slower passenger transit at a harmonised speed.  Freight rail is often overlooked but this is one of the things that the USA does well that we don't so much in Europe, where our system is a result of charters that specifically forced railways to support passengers.  Freight rail is problematic.. The reason is that for many uses you don't want a hugely long train because many places wouldn't fit it. To get more road freight onto railways you need sidings and feeder networks, such as to industrial estates and retail hubs. These would need some innovation, such as smaller freight multiple units that could be autonomously able to link up into larger trains on main corridors.\n\nSubsidise e-scooters, bikes and e-bikes, build out cycle routes and pedestrian spaces, potentially include solar canopies for all weather protection where viable. Build personalised-transport storage arears and racking that is secure from theft, provide low cost charging. Integrate e-scooter hiring and storage with trams and bus stops and the ticketing of which to create a more complete alternative. A standardised compact e-bike that can be carried on mass transit perhaps, with a modular freight towable solution that can be hired when needed.\n\n**The Car Industry**\n\nObviously they wont like any of that if the car market were to shrink considerably. They are extremely powerful lobbyists and employers. However they could be converted to be allies by a shrewd government. Back in WW2 and just prior to it, the U.S government redirected American auto manufacturers to retool to build military equipment, like airframes, aero-engines, ships, tanks etc.\n\nAnd the car industry did not mind one bit. Why should, a company like Tesla see its future building steel car chassis frames rather than the infrastructure for new tram ways and suspended transit systems?\n\nOne thing that the government can do is simply redirect the energy and car manufacturing subsidies towards things like home energy systems, such as integrated cladding and P.V., heat pumps, structural solar roofs etc. This is a huge build out and market that they could compete to manufacture, and they are good at one thing - making things. Each home needs more wall insulation, and more efficient heat pumps. They could be net energy contributors by integrating wind and solar power into the roof (such as the Aeromine system which could generate more energy than solar on each rooftop). Houses could be 3D scanned and car manufacturers could devise production lines to make bespoke cladding and roofs to fit on each one, and the various systems like heat pumps. They could cooperate with energy companies to build out district heating and power networks (microgrids) as a new kind of utility. At the same time they might get preferential rates on the purchase of excess energy. These are just possibilities, but we know these industries can convert, its all about the incentive.",

      "title": "Improving motorised transport, scooters and e-bikes",
      "text": "Just as I type this another post on here talks about the difficulties heavier people have with getting around. We can all see that simple things like electric buggies, mobility scooters, e-bikes etc all would be far more appropriately sized and engineered for cities and towns and greatly more affordable.\n\nBut, in London and other cities the perception by regulators is that they are a menace and this is due to a minority of people that abuse the e-scooters by riding at full speed on pavements and recklessly.\n\nBut, technology is improving which opens up a couple of things. The first is more accurate GPS, so speed limiters could be automatically applied when riding the pavement. GPS signals could also be more accurate if produced from lamp posts.\n\nHaving speed limiters like this would mean we could make e-bikes, scooters and mobility scooters more powerful, increased from say 250 watt maximum power to e.g. 500 watt and to 1 kW for larger vehicles and delivery buggies, or to higher maximum speed.\n\nNow not only can more people use these devices in different terrain, but the legal maximum speed can be increased to what in the UK is the residential speed limit of 20mph (approx 30kmph.) from 16 mph.\n\nIt makes sense for all vehicles on these streets to travel at the same speed. And I believe this is ultimately safer. Moreover, research shows that the optimal speed for the road capacity is around 22 mph, so above or below this, the road capacity decreases.\n\nWith smart speed limiters and self driving capabilities, mobility scooters could be uprated for use on residential roads. And, residential roads could be networked so you could travel about almost anywhere exclusively on these roads, opening up a new class of road legal electric vehicle based on classic mobility scooters, golf cart type vehicles etc.\n\nElectric bikes and mopeheads (conventional scooters of 50 cc or 125 cc engine displacements) also can be very efficient, potentially between 20 to 30 km / kWh, and electric hybrid bicycles considerably higher than that. The parking area for these vehicles receives easily enough energy from the sun, that via a solar panel equal to the space above it, provide all the average energy requirement for these vehicles over most of the year. There may be some basic licensing and increased wattage limits for registered vehicles used by heavier people.\n\nThere is a huge cost associated with providing bigger public transport solutions for mobility impaired people, and this could be more effective and energy efficient. Because of low occupancy rates on many buses, the energy efficiency of electric scooters and e-bikes can be better than for conventional buses. Although we don't want to lose them, there are attractive alternatives.",

      "text": "Is there anywhere in the world that has used an expansion of the category of vehicles that require a commercial driver's license in order to curb the sales of oversized trucks to people who don't need them?\n\nIn the US, you currently you only need a CDL if the vehicle exceeds 26,000 lbs or carries more than 8 passengers. What if that was dropped to 6,000 lbs, plus a stipulation that vehicles with a hood height greater than 40\" also require a CDL to drive? An exemption for short term rentals would allow most people to accomplish what they need to, and those who actually need large trucks for work would get some extra training to account for the fact that they're driving a more dangerous vehicle. It'd also disincentivize auto-makers from making super tall and heavy trucks for their best selling models.\n\nNot politically viable anywhere in the US probably, but maybe in Europe? I'm very worried by the prospect of near-silent 9,000 pound electric mega-trucks driving around cities en masse.",

One common trend that I see in many places that I have been to are the bike lines that are built in expense of the pedestrian roads instead of a car roads. Personally this makes me really annoyed and I feel like this is some way of the municipal government saying \"we are making our cities to be not just car friendly\" without actually doing much.\n\nAnother issue that I have with this approach is the safety. Bicycles and electric scooters are still a kind of vehicles that can cause a serious injury when collided with you. The fact that you can't really hear them until it is too late, and some cyclists not bothering to warm you doesn't make the situation any better. This is also extremely dangerous for the people with visual and hearing issues. Another obvious problem that I see are the roads becoming more cramped with people.\n\nWhat do you think? My take is that you can't really say that you are making cities accessible when you basically just punish pedestrians to built the bike lines but turn a blind eye on the fact that many cities are still designated to be the car centric.",

A used transmission would have been 3500.00 USD and a new one would have been 4000.00 USD.\n\nSo, I ditched the car and got a 50cc scooter. It was nice a quiet and got me from point A to point B at a max speed of 38 mph/61 km/h. Then I got a 150cc scooter, which is garbage and I quit riding it becuase of how often it broke down\n\nAll of those vehicles are absurdly loud and I fucking hate it. So, I want an electric motorcycle and was thinking about going with a Zero Motorcycle, since people in FL drive fast and wrecklessly, also, everything is so far away too\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is: When are we getting our public transit and bicycle/walking areas? :D",

Reasons I've heard include keeping the seals from drying out and leaking, keeping the brakes from rusting, the fact that fuel has a limited lifespan and shouldn't be left sitting too long, something about circulating the fluids, and keeping rodents and pests from getting in. Of course, it helps that it keeps the battery charged as well, especially in the winter.\n\nI live in a suburban neighbourhood in a car-centric city. My house has a driveway but no garage, so my car is parked outdoors. I live within easy walking distance of a discount supermarket; moreover, I can cycle to the local commuter rail station in less than 10 minutes, mostly along a safe trail that is beautiful when it's not winter, and the remainder along low-traffic residential streets. Very close to the train station is a large plaza with a variety of businesses, a general store, and another supermarket. However, there are also some stores I may go to that are too far away to walk and too dangerous to cycle to. Plus, if I want to go to the city centre, I can drive for 20 minutes, or I can get there by bus in over an hour. It's also safe to cycle there, because there are multi-use paths all along the stroads that lead there, but that would take even longer.",

This would happen at a dedicated section of the platform segregated from passengers.\n\nIn the US there was the inter-urban concept, and in the UK we have slower regional passenger rail, which are suitable speeds for freight services and mixing these services may make sense, with both mixed trains and dedicated freight or passenger trains sharing the route at the same speeds with a few passing loops. I would think this sort of service might be limited to about 60 to 70 mph, or less on some routes at about 50 mph, and such services are designed to be cheap to install on account of the slower speed - the vehicles may be self powered multiple units that are autonomous and not require continuous electrification. Fuel cells, and batteries, are coming along as viable alternatives for these lower power applications, and they can recharge at sections of the route where unloading is not required.\n\nDedicated freight trains and passenger trains may also share these routes but at a harmonised speed to maximise frequency.\n\nIn urban areas trams may share those routes, or freight may be transferred to freight trams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "Idea for more flexible transportation",
      "text": "So I had this idea recently that I\u0019ve been playing with in my mind and I wanted to throw it out to see what you all think.\n\nSelf driving cars have been touted as some saviour to traffic but the reality is, it may just make things even worse. It just means more people taking more unnecessary trips and ultimately more cars on the road.\n\nWhat if instead we made a self driving vehicle with seating for 20. 4 seats in each row with all of the rows not accessible to each other. Have 1 row with 4 seats together (for larger groups/family) and the remaining 4 rows with a divider in the middle creating 8 two seat areas that are separate from all other seats.\n\nIf you could open an app and order a ride on demand, this self driving car would come and open a specific door for you. With enough people using the service, you could have most seats filled during rush hour traffic with little more commute time as an algorithm would be able to determine the best people to group into the same car (e.g. they are all going to the arcade from a similar area).\n\nBy using electric power and not having a lot of room to haul stuff around they could be the same size as a normal car. With this being more for just commuting in the city, you could use half the batteries or perhaps even less just fill up more often thereby greatly reducing the impact to the environment from lithium mining.\n\nDuring non-peak times the vehicle may only have 1 passenger but will be able to more efficiently transport during rush hour. \n\nOk, I can hear it. I know what you are thinking: it\u0019s called a bus, stupid (insert car brain insults). This solves a few other problems though: \n\nPeople don\u0019t really like being around other people. Some of the complaints about buses is that there are \u001cunsavoury people\u001d they have to be around and that buses may not be safe for children. Self driving buses would have no one to monitor the situation and there could be more crime on buses if they went the self driving route.\n\nFurther to the last point, buses are not safe for kids where as a completely separated area helps to make this safe while in the vehicle.\n\nBuses just keep driving around even when no one is there to pick up. I realize this may be very short lived but it happens.\n\nSome cities have areas where the density is too low to have buses run all the time. This makes the use of public transportation very difficult whereas a vehicle that picks you up on demand could work.\n\nBuses stop running at a certain point. This means that some people think they still need a car. An on demand service completely takes away that excuse.\n\nThis type of vehicle could transport 60+ people a day and may be able to service up to 30 people and replace 15-20 cars. I just pulled these numbers out of my ass, but they seem reasonable to me.\n\nOf course this would take a huge percentage of the population to make it would BUT could greatly reduce traffic and the need for as many roads.\n\nA few notes: \n\nIf your party is larger than 4, you can use more than 1 area.\n\nPeople could pay extra to get a 2 seat pod to themselves (pay for both seats)\n\nParking could just be on the streets where they are most likely to be needed next.\n\nYou would need a way to build charging stations everywhere and they would have to be a very high amp to charge quickly and save on power. Where you would build these and how you get permission to do this would be hard to figure out. You would want it to be automatic as well.\n\nIf someone needed to move something or have more than a backpack or suitcase, they would need to use something else.\n\nThis doesn\u0019t solve all vehicle needs but does cover the majority of trips people need. More people could probably go to 1 vehicle or including a truck rental (self driving, comes to your door) service for 500% more cost could be a good option as sometimes (though very rarely) people need that.\n\nI also realize this would be hard in smaller cities.\n\nThoughts? Critics are welcome to poke holes in my argument!",

There have been ten official versions to date. Lancer Evolutions were successful in WRC Rallies from 1996 to 1999, mostly in the hands of Finnish driver Tommi Mäkinen, clinching driver's titles in four-consecutive seasons from 1996 to 1999 (in Evolutions III, IV, V, and VI). Note that start date of 1992. Between 1992 and 2016, world population rose by over 1 billion, however our public transport infrastructure failed to adapt to this change appropriately, especially in the united states, with car dependent infrastructure. This then shifted the market for vehicles away from sports orientated vehicles, as more \"\"\"\"\"\"\"practical\"\"\"\"\"\"\" utility vehicles came into demand instead. Because of public transport not being adapted to the population change, more people needed \"commuter purpose\" vehicles, as they could not commute via alternative methods due to alternative methods either being overloaded and hence seen as unappealing (e.g. underdeveloped metros) or straight up absent (e.g. Intercity HighSpeed rail), limiting them to own a car that would be suited for more frequent use as opposed to a purpose sport vehicle. In late March 2014, it was revealed that the production of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution would end after the 2015 model year. Mitsubishi instead wished to focus on \"concentrating its efforts on crossover vehicles and electric vehicles instead.\"\n\nTL:DR; I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS",

      "text": "If you dont know what technicals are, they are basically a Toyota Hilux single cab pick up truck with a DSHK HMG bolted on a swiveling pintle to the truck bed. Ever since the Toyota war between Chad and Libya more or less pioneered the technical, every conflict ever since including Ukraine and Myanmar has been using the \"light\" (in military terms, but very heavy in civilian terms) vehicles and light weaponry as a very effective low cost tactic of fighting asymmetrical warfare.\n\nEven lighter vehicles have been employed in combat roles, WW2 had motorcycles with sidecar mounted machine guns, today's insurgencies commonly use motorcycle technicals with rpk's mounted on them. I thought based on that, why couldn't we do the same with bicycles and ebikes?\n\nBicycle mounted infantry had been a relatively common tactic from 1890-1910, the Nazis confiscated bicycles from occupied territories to serve as transport vehicles for their armed forces, and in the modern age with cargo ebikes being able to carry an adult passenger and a total mass of 250+ kg, I don't see why something like the [Propel Urban Arrow](https://propelbikes.com/product/urban-arrow-family-cargo/) or any analog or electric bakfiet couldn't have a pintle mounted machine gun in the front cargo basket or otherwise be used as a patrol / logistics vehicle, especially in places where full sized automobiles and trucks are too big to fit or otherwise are inadvisable.\n\nWhile I am aware the Ukrainian ebikes seen in [this article](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html) are more like Surrons and e motorcycles, the same concepts of micromobility in combat still apply to lighter ebikes imo. They dont use gasoline, they are quiet and far less detectable via sound and thermal signature, the fact that they are smaller than cars means they are smaller targets and take up less space, they can be recharged by the electrical grid assuming its still running in the area of operations, and even with dead batteries, they carry more cargo at a faster speed than personnel on foot.\n\nThis is definitely an idea i would say most of the pro 2nd crowd in the USA is completely overlooking in their blind support for rolling coal and lifted trucks.",

      "text": "Cars suck. They\u0019re smelly and noisy. Ideally, we want them to be *out* of city-centers.\n\nThere have been a [few recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/vbf2dz/so_near_and_yet_so_far/) on this sub which suggested that cities should move car traffic underground and redevelop the surface to create spaces like the Rose Kennedy Greenway in Boston.\n\nThe resulting greenway is Nice\", so on the \"surface\", this seems like a pretty good idea, right? (pun intended).\n\nUndoubtedly, Elon Musk\u0019s Tesla Tunnels have contributed to this idea\u0019s popularity, but, like everything else from Papa Musk, it\u0019s actually not that great when you apply critical thinking.\n\nLet\u0019s look at the [Big Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig), what it accomplished, and how much it actually cost.\n\nThe Big Dig has been estimated to have a total cost of **\\~$22 Billion**\n\n\u001cIn total, the project built 161 lane-miles of highway, about half in tunnels, and four major highway interchanges\u001d\n\nThe money was not just spent building tunnels, it was also spent demolishing the existing elevated highway and creating the Rose Kennedy Greenway. It also includes many expenses that are not directly involved with \u001c*just digging a tunnel\u001d*, such as design work by an engineering firm, eminent domain to obtain the required land rights, moving existing infrastructure out of the tunnel path (i.e. water mains and sewage lines), having a worker go out and place traffic cones for a road closure - it all factors in. Especially the expenses your average person never even considers.\n\nContrary to what Elon Musk would have you believe, it\u0019s not as simple as \u001c*just digging a tunnel*\u001d.\n\nWe\u0019ll use the Big Dig as a benchmark for the use of tunnels to replace surface highways. To this point, we must assume that, to put a highway into a tunnel, work must be done on the surface to feed traffic into the tunnel. This might result in the creation of new surface lanes.\n\nThe Big Dig had mistakes that ran up the budget. We *can* say that we\u0019ve learned from those mistakes and won\u0019t repeat them, but there will be new mistakes, there will be lawsuits (there always are). There will be unpredictable situations that pop up during construction that cause delays and work stoppage.\n\nFor example, suppose that during the process of digging a tunnel, it is discovered that the geological conditions in a certain spot will cause the tunnel to eventually collapse.\n\n* Option 1, the tunnel can be redirected around the problem area.\n* Option 2, additional excavation and reinforcement can allow the tunnel to be placed in the original spot.\n\nBoth solutions cause unplanned expenses and delays.\n\nFurthermore, different regions have different conditions. In the southern US, a high concentration of clay in the soil causes excavation to be more expensive, structures below-grade must be reinforced against hydrostatic pressure, and extensive pumping &amp; draining must be installed. On the US west coast, earthquakes are a considerable risk. Tunnels require additional reinforcement to avoid being sheared during lateral movement from an earthquake (causing the tunnel to be cut off from the surface).\n\nWhile tunnels *may* be built at a lower cost in ideal regions (Midwest, Great Plains), other regions may see higher costs for tunnels. We also have to account for future inflation. Even if we could do the Big Dig again for \u001cless\u001d than $22bn, inflation might eat up our \u001csavings\u001d before the project is complete.\n\nUltimately, we can set the Big Dig as a per-lane-mile benchmark upon which the cost of putting lanes underground (in any given area) averages out.\n\nPer Lane-Mile: If you have a 1-Mile long tunnel with two lanes of roadway in it, you have 2 Lane-Miles\n\nThe Big Dig resulted in 80 lane-miles in tunnels. It cost $22 Billion\n\nThe cost per Lane-Mile is $275,000,000\n\nNow let\u0019s apply this on a broader scale. Let\u0019s assume that a random metro area in the US wants to bury some urban highways (or other arterial roads) and create surface greenways in the land footprint of the current highways.\n\nFor the sake of the argument, let\u0019s assume a metro area wants to create 200 lane-miles in tunnels in/around their downtown, and redevelop the surface space into greenway.\n\nThis comes to a cost of **$55,000,000,000 (Fifty Five Billion Dollars)** for this ONE metro area.\n\nWhat do they really gain?\n\nBoston tried it and it didn't solve their car-dependence. Sure, it made downtown Boston a much more pleasant place, but it continued to enable people to live far away and drive. Ultimately, those cars come back up to the surface when they get off the highway, and there they are polluting the city with exhaust and noise.\n\nSo for $55 Billion, you basically just get to hide your highways, pretty your downtown, and not much else.\n\nLet\u0019s put this in perspective. What kind of public transit could we provide for **$55 billion**?\n\nNYC has the largest municipal bus fleet in the US: \u001cIts fleet of 5,725 buses is the largest municipal bus fleet in the United States and operates 24/7.\u001d It also serves some 14,000 bus stops.\n\n**For $55 Billion, instead of burying their highways, this** ***ONE*** **metro area could:**\n\n* Make commuter cars illegal to drive in the city (service vehicles would still be allowed with a permit).\n* Buy **30,000** fully electric busses (**$24 Billion**)\n* Build **20,000** sheltered bus stops with bathrooms, drinking fountains, and an overhead charger for the busses to use while stopped (**$1 billion**)\n* Spend **$5 Billion** reclaiming tens of thousands of unneeded lane-miles of surface-level streets and stroads (reclaimed lanes could be turned into bike lanes, sidewalks that didn\u0019t exist before, or just planted to help reduce water runoff, soak up sunlight and reduce heat).\n* Have **$25 billion** left over to pay drivers and run the buses every 15 minutes (resulting in the transit system being fare-free).\n* Additionally, it would make hundreds of acres of surface parking lots obsolete and available for redevelopment.\n\nCar tunnels are just more car-infrastructure. It's just one more expense.\n\nIt'd be better to just improve public transit and take cars off the road in the first place.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big\\_Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig)\n\n[https://www.mass.gov/info-details/the-big-dig-facts-and-figures](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/the-big-dig-facts-and-figures)\n\n[https://www.liveabout.com/bus-cost-to-purchase-and-operate-2798845](https://www.liveabout.com/bus-cost-to-purchase-and-operate-2798845)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA\\_Regional\\_Bus\\_Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA_Regional_Bus_Operations)\n\n[https://www.ny.com/transportation/buses/ridebuses.html](https://www.ny.com/transportation/buses/ridebuses.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: links didn't format right",

Typically there are still 1-2 parking spaces per house but these don't take up much more additional space. This mixture of developments allows for more density and a wider pallette of income groups.\n\nCommercial developments and stores are also allowed.\n\nFurthermore, larger industry is allowed and situated at the edge so no one is disturbed by it.\n\nThese businesses bring money to the town, help it prosper and keep a positive balance sheet.\n\nAlso: no HOA! Nobody can dictate how your house/garden has to look like (except zoning laws, of course) and additionally new developments aren't carried out by large corporations so there are no neighbourhoods made completely out of similar looking houses.\n\n\n\n2) infrastructure\n\nThere is regular bus service from 5:30 to 23:30 on weekdays and from 00:00 to 3:30 / 5:30 to 00:00 on weekends.\n\n-&gt; Connections to the rest of the country are very good, meaning I can get away 80 km from home in an hour just by public transit.\n\n*I do need to add though that transit is way to expensive here which is one major drawback\n\nFurthermore, residential streets are narrow and don't allow more than 30km/h. The main road has two lanes, one for each direction and is capped at 50km/h. So you can comfortably cycle through the town in in residential streets (or one the main road, even though it's less pleasant) and walk on the continuous sidewalk. These things allow people to live without a car, reduce sprawling as less land is zoned for roads or parking.\n\n\n\n3) small businesses\n\nSmaller services such as hairdressers don't require a large customer base and are thus ideal for serving your village or maybe additionally your neighbour village. It's completely possible to run a business in your home or use part of your property for business.\n\n \n\n4) financing\n\nThere is no large town here that could support the suburbs. Thus single-family developments have to be paid for and aren't carried by subsidies. This isn't that tragic though as most middle class citizens can afford multi- or single family homes - their cost is reduced by not being dependent on a car and not being far away from everything else.\n\nIf you can't afford that you can still rent an apartment!\n\n\n\nSo, according to some people this place here should be an overdense shithole? Not at all, it's peaceful, spacious and there are a lot of green spaces.\n\nAll in all, I like how we do things here. Reducing car dependency leads to more flexibility in life, more prosperity and more communal, liveable places and I hope this way of building towns becomes commonplace everywhere.",

I said better planning of cities and development where less people have to use cars and getting less cars on the road is a more important goal.  It could even make it better for those who want to drive and emergency vehicles if there is less traffic.\n\nStill I get most people currently in the US have to deal with a reality where you have to drive.

And the state of our electric grid is not an individual person's fault even if we can make the choice to use less energy.  I overheat easy and I live in Florida, I'm using AC.

      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

Since 1990, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the weight of the average pickup has increased by twelve hundred and fifty-six pounds\u0014thirty-two per cent. A recent post on Vice observed that the largest pickups and S.U.V.s today are as big as Second World War-era tanks. Now pickups are going to get heavier still. The Lightning, because of its lithium-ion battery, weighs approximately sixty-five hundred pounds; in some cases the pickup can be more than two thousand pounds heavier than its gas counterpart. You\u0019ll be capable of assaulting a mountaintop redoubt, even if you\u0019re just driving to the store for milk.\n\nNot only are large E.V.s not as green as smaller E.V.s.; what about all the people who aren\u0019t in big vehicles? Analysis from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has shown that pedestrians who are hit by pickups or S.U.V.s are two to three times more likely to die than those who are hit by cars. In fact, the number of pedestrians killed by vehicles rose forty-six per cent between 2010 and 2019. According to the Governors Highway Safety Association, if you count deaths against vehicle miles travelled, 2020 saw the largest increase in pedestrian fatalities (twenty-one per cent) since nationwide tracking started, in 1975. Even though fewer vehicles were on the road early in the pandemic, more people died.\"\n\nIn my opinion electrifying is not the solution.\n\nLet's have a meaningful discussion about this.",

My city was far from the best for car-free living, but I've made it work.\n\nThis year we moved to the suburbs. In some respects it's great: much cheaper property prices, there's a bike path network which runs out into the surrounding countryside with lochs and fields and forests. But practically, day-to-day transport is a nightmare. Instead of everything being conveniently located on mixed-use streets, shops and gyms tend to be scattered on business \"parks\" at the edge of town. I've had some near misses with idiot drivers, and I don't feel safe at all with my kids riding on the road.\n\nThen there's the coronavirus situation. I have drastically cut my public transport use in recent years, but when I've taken a train or a bus I've been shocked at the number of people not wearing masks. Like, 70% of passengers. Sometimes I feel close to a panic attack.\n\nSo I find myself actually contemplating doing what I thought I'd never do, getting my driving licence and buying a car. It seems crazy: at least £9,000 for a used electric vehicle, £750 a year for insurance and completely rearranging a lifestyle that has worked for me my whole life.

This risks missing out on benefits like new jobs, a more resilient economy and healthier communities.*\n\n*The Commission\u0019s advice makes 27 recommendations to the Government, focused on areas where there are critical gaps in action, or where efforts need to be strengthened or accelerated. This includes:*\n\n- *Build more renewable electricity, such as solar, wind, and geothermal, and ensure networks keep up with growing and variable demand*\n\n- *Support moves to swap fossil fuels for renewable energy in heating and industry*\n\n- *Retrofit buildings so they are healthier, more resilient, lower emissions and cheaper to run*\n\n- *Avoid installing new fossil gas in buildings where there are affordable low emissions alternatives.*\n\n- *Encourage households and businesses to switch to electric vehicles*\n\n- *Make it easier for more people to choose public or active transport*\n\n- *Prepare for the rapid roll-out of low emissions technologies and practices on farms*\n\n- *Directly resource iwi/M\u0001ori efforts to reduce climate pollution*\n\n- *Sort out the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and the role of forests*\n\n- *Commit to how much climate pollution must be cut at its source*\n\n- *Manage the impacts of climate policy on people, businesses and communities using existing policy options while a broader strategy is developed*\n\n*Between 2026\u00132030, the country needs to reduce its climate pollution by the equivalent of 43.5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide \u0013 about the same as 3.6 million cars would produce in the same period. Around 40% of the cuts are expected to come from energy and industry.*\n\n*The biggest opportunity is to replace fossil fuels \u0013 like coal, gas and petrol \u0013 with renewable energy, to power our industries, our buildings and our transport systems.

Gave me a whole day to use it, and therefore to charge it, so I chose an electric car. I\u0019ll come back to it in a moment.\n\nHaving full access to a car, on-demand, made me understand why carbrains say cars are freedom. Because it does feel like that.\nOf course I am but too aware of the issues and costs of a car, so I could tamper the feeling. But anyone in car culture will not. They will only feel that \"freedom\" which comes with their car.\n\nNote that one could feel similar with a bike, but my experience here got exacerbated by how I didn\u0019t have access to a bike at the moment (on vacation).\n\nAs for the electric car - compared to a gas car. Super fun to drive, ngl. On sunday, while I was looking for a charger, I tried the acceleration on an empty parking lot. Blissful and exhilarating experience. Such a pain in the ass to charge though.\n\nI had a small car (Peugeot e208), 50kWh battery. Fully charging it on the wall outlet would have taken 50h, so I went to find a charger. What a nightmare. Not only is it not that much cheaper than gas for a fuel-efficient vehicle, but you must give up your privacy to charge your car. It\u0019s not like the gas pump, you have to use a website to pay, and enter your email address, when it doesn\u0019t force you to create an account and store your credit card info on their server.\n\nIn the end, 5/10. If I don\u0019t have to deal with the charge, I\u0019ll happily rent an electric car again (if I need a car ofc).\n\nIf I ever get a car, it will be a station wagon or minivan, when I\u0019ll have at least 4 children (or maybe 3, trains don\u0019t usually have 5/6-seat spaces), and it will be a diesel, only used to carry the family across the country on vacation, or to bring absurd amounts of shit to the recycling plant.",

My city is literally based around public transport and despite the fact the car road system is decent as well and both of them being constantly upgraded, owning a car here is controversial at best and unreasonable at worst.\n\nIn my city of Moscow I can get literally anywhere on the map in 30 min from the center within city limits (and Moscow ain't a small city), 50-60 within close to mid suburban. It takes around 50 minutes to get from the northern border to the southern and vice versa. 85% of city limits are reachable by metro + 5-15 min walk, for further places busses course regularly (mostly EV ones). Also there are plenty of alternative public transportation as well like trams, trolleys, suburban trains (my personal favorite), monorail, a few cable car routes and recently even river trams were proposed. And for those rare occasions where you absolutely need a personal car there's a very extensive car sharing service starting from 12 RUB/min (about 19 cents). \n\nTaxis are also very numerous and cheap, a ride on a Polo/Rio/Solaris class across the city border to border will cost you about 600-800 rub (10-15 bucks) depending on current demand. Better vehicles like Passat/Optima/Sonata will be around 20 bucks, and for 50+ you'll ride the s-class like a chad. A single universal ticket for metro/buss/train/tram costs 55 rub (about 85 cents), a card for a week or more will be like twice as cheap per ride. This is much much more economic than having your own car, especially when you take parking prices, gas etc. into the account. \n\nI'm 22 y. o. and I can't even imagine myself owning a car without a solid reason like having 3+ kids or a personal business or a job somewhere unreachable by other transport and even then 2/3 cases an alternative like a car sharing or taxi would be better and cheaper in long term. \n\nThe point is when the city has a proper public transportation system, cars become obsolete and irrelevant, and because of that mayor administration plans to close the city center for cars entirely by 2030 and even now about 30-40% of streets are pedestrian only and parking prices within the historical center are outrageous. \n\nMy hot take is that cars should be regulated like guns are (edit: like in EU or here in Russia), so in order to get one you'd have to go through multiple examinations, mandatory extreme driving classes for better driving skills in extreme situations, get a special permission from the city, and of course be taxed minimum twice the value as well as spare parts for them. Gas should be taxed even more, minimum 80% of its price being excise price tax, like cigarettes and booze. The state should discourage new car purchases by all means necessary, personal transport in a modern city is simply an unnecessary luxury and should be treated as such.\n\nEVs and hybrids are just as bad unless you're planning to use them for 10+ years and don't change your battery even once, because otherwise you're not only not reducing emissions and pollution but increasing it, it's just being released elsewhere. Don't fool yourself.",

      "text": "[https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/12/jaywalking-auto-pedoni/](https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/12/jaywalking-auto-pedoni/)\n\nThe article tells also about the origin of the word \"jaywalking\" and how it was used by the car industry to shift the responsibility against pedestrians. In the final part talks about what happened in Italy.\n\nA century ago, in the early twenties, cars were a novelty. In Italy, where they circulated in the tens of thousands, they were almost a rarity. But even in the United States, where they had begun to spread much earlier and had done so much more quickly, they arrived quite suddenly and spread and imposed themselves on roads that until a few years before were traveled by pedestrians, horses, wagons or carriages. So much so that in the early twenties in the United States, they caused serious problems and thousands of deaths per year. Especially among pedestrians, especially children, accustomed to move freely in the street, in contexts where cars did not exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a time, about a century ago, when in the United States the protests against cars and their intrusion into the streets that until then belonged to others were many and intense. But the automotive industry reacted and managed - in a very short time and with great effectiveness - to turn the situation around. The idea that roads should be cars and that pedestrians should be considered guilty if they were hit became common sense. It all had a lot to do with an aggressive and highly effective campaign tied to a simple word: jaywalking, still used in the United States today to define the act of recklessly crossing the street where it's not allowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main research on how and when the concept of jaywalking was introduced, and how relevant it was in reversing an increasingly negative perception of cars, has been done by the American Peter D. Norton, historian and author of the book Fighting Traffic. Interviewed a few years ago by Vox, Norton said, \"In the early days of automobiles, it was up to drivers to avoid pedestrians, not the other way around,\" and speaking with Bloomberg he added, \"If we ask today whose roads are whose, we hear the answer that they are cars, it's just the opposite of what we would have been told a hundred years ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New York City street in the 1920s (Keystone/Getty Images)   \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili19.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili19.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Crosswalks,\" albeit without parallel white stripes, are about as old as pedestrians, and have been around since well before cars. They're one of those things of which it can be said that, albeit in their own way, \"they were already there in Pompeii.\" Certainly, however, in the United States in the early 1900s, the streets belonged to pedestrians more than anyone else. Horses were anything but a novelty, rail vehicles were predictable in their progress, and cars were rare, expensive, noisy, and rather slow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings changed when Henry Ford's Model T, a car designed to be mass-produced and capable of reaching a top speed of about 70 kilometers per hour, became popular. In the years after the First World War and even more so in the first half of the \"roaring\" Twenties, more and more Americans found themselves behind the wheel of heavy and fast cars, without the roads, the rules and what today we would call \"other road users\" having had time and opportunity to adapt to this bursting novelty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New York street in 1923 (AP Photo)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP2301010217-2048x1414.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP2301010217-2048x1414.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1924 the Ford Motor Company's dealers were about ten thousand, and in that period - in which the United States had more or less 115 million people living - the country exceeded the significant threshold of one car for every 10 inhabitants. Motels (short for \"motor-hotel\"), drive-ins and a host of other car-related activities and pastimes were born. But there were also intense protests from those who, more than anything else, found themselves subjected to cars. Especially in urban areas, in fact, cars became one of the main causes of death: in the twenties, only in the United States, they caused the death of about 200 thousand people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCars were therefore seen as a serious threat. Cartoons and comics depicted drivers as \"Death\", complete with scythe. There were those who spoke of a \"terrible massacre that must be stopped\", and there were those who lobbied for cars to be fitted with speed limiters, a bit like what happens today with electric scooters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn November 1924, a full-page headline in the New York Times spoke of the United States as a country \"in revolt against motor homicide.\"  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JW2.jpeg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JW2.jpeg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe article began thus:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The horrors of war turn out to be less terrifying than those of peace. Cars stand out as far more lethal mechanisms than machine guns. The reckless driver claims more lives than the gunner. Those in the streets are less safe than those in the trenches. Fifteen thousand of our men were killed in the nineteen months of our participation in the World War. Two thousand deaths a month, a modest number when compared with the staggering toll of seven thousand lives ended each month by accidents in the United States. The automobile is the largest single cause of death.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it contained this simple chart:\n\n(New York Times)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyt-copia.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyt-copia.jpg)\n\nAs recalled in a recent article written by Clive Thompson on Medium, in 1922 in New York City a demonstration for road safety was organized: among others, about 10,000 children had marched and 1,054 of them were made to walk apart, to represent the deaths caused the previous year by cars in New York.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThompson also cites a figure that in 1924, there were 12 percent fewer cars sold in the United States than the previous year. The automotive industry realized that the situation was serious and threatened to become very serious. First of all, it tried to promote courses and awareness campaigns for young people, for example by going to schools to remind them to pay attention to traffic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbove all, however, the automotive industry began to talk about jay walking. The word, now in common use in U.S. English, combined the word \"walking\" with \"jay\", a term used at the beginning of the 20th century to denote, in a derogatory manner, someone not very bright from the countryside, a \"yokel\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not clear how and when the word was born - on whose origin there are also a couple of other theories with much less supporters - but it seems that at the beginning it was used, apart from car-related contexts, to talk about someone who came from outside to the city, wandering awkwardly and without knowing what to do or where to go. Thanks to an intense campaign, in which newspapers filled with car advertisements played a relevant role, the word began to be used to refer to pedestrians who crossed the street carelessly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, those who drove - and could afford a car - were the future and were in the right. Those who remained pedestrians, and couldn't even figure out when and how to let cars pass, were the past, were cut off. Rather than a campaign of empowerment, it was in some ways a very effective victim blaming effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(National SafetyCouncil)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jw4.png](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jw4.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were those who tried to react, among other things trying to talk about jay driving, but jay walking had much better luck, moreover becoming a single word: jaywalking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this regard, Norton describes an event organized in the twenties in New York in which a clown who does not know how to cross a street is repeatedly hit, at very low speed, by a Model T, for which - watching the scene - you end up obviously taking sides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second half of the Twenties, car sales started to rise again: road deaths and massacres in the United States were less and less talked about, with different tones and less frequency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew York City in 1933 (Jack Maytig/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili13.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili13.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, there were only one car per 500 inhabitants in Italy: very few, even compared to countries like France, Germany and the United Kingdom. There was one car for every ten inhabitants only in 1965, forty years later than in the United States. What Model Ts had done there, FIAT's 600s and 500s did here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatteo Dondè - an architect and urban planner who is an expert in issues concerning bicycle mobility and traffic calming - explains that, in effect, what happened in the United States after World War I, happened in Italy after World War II. But in a different way, because the period and the context were different. According to him, for Italy, \"the theme of squares was representative, public places par excellence that, from one moment to the next, became spaces to be dedicated to cars\". It happened in Piazza Duomo in Milan, Piazza del Campo in Siena and even in Rome around the Colosseum, \"without even the car manufacturers having to commit themselves as they had done in America\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, continues Dondè, everything happened almost naturally, because - even without the active influence of the \"communicating force\" of the powerful and influential car manufacturers - in Italy \"the country of small towns, the car was even more of an element of freedom than elsewhere\". A certain victimization of pedestrians was therefore a consequence of the spread of cars, rather than something planned from above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere isn't, in Italian, a single word to translate the concept of jaywalking, but according to Dondè the thought at the base of the concept is well present. For example, it can be found in the meaning of the word \"accident\", or in the perception of many road deaths as a \"fatality\", or even in expressions such as \"overturning car\", \"hit-and-run driver\". Or again, in the references, even recent and institutional ones, to pedestrians as subjects that \"must be educated\" and that, in any case, must remain subordinate to cars.  \n[https://twitter.com/Nigel\\_\\_DSouza/status/1482685066132160512](https://twitter.com/Nigel__DSouza/status/1482685066132160512)\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)\n\nI hope that it was an interesting read for you and that you learned many new things about roads and cars.

      "text": "Speedometers on nearly all cars exceed what they are capable of.   \nAutomakers do this to psychologically imply that their vehicles have performance. Most cars are likely to never reach their country's maximum speed limit. Even if they can go so far past these legal traffic limits, drivers will either be violating traffic laws or legally racing. It's just a cosmetic that is less functional.\n\n[Toyota Camry Hybrid](https://preview.redd.it/k2k8wl19gux81.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d03230d3048db88024032d839e3e98e30ee1c3c)\n\nI thought to write this up as I was gonna rant about a car attempting to dominate me today. I was going 30km/h (quite strenuous) up a hill towards a dead end 100 metres ahead with a turn coming up 70m and some driver was busting to overtake me. I was holding my lane by riding in the middle because they most likely wanted to overtake then turn across in front of me even when their turn was so close. I hardly hold up traffic for more than 20 seconds because I know the area but these drivers have no patience. I could see their headlights swerving and hear their engine exerting sporadically for acceleration. I feel lucky that they stayed behind me and didn't hit me. \n\nI think speedometers with these high speeds are likely to incentivise speeding and risky behaviour. Traffic speed limits look quite miniscule on speedometers especially when they are behind a cyclist in which I was today. Speedometers with these hard to see increments seem to allow manufacturers to cover up speedometer inaccuracies. \n\nSpeedometers of cars that aren't recommended for race tracks should have maximum speeds that are slightly faster than the average maximum speed limits globally. Drivers will see their speedometer with greater visual accuracy and more needle action so they can easily avoid a speeding ticket. \n\nI do like how most modern cars now have a large digital readout of speed. In my encounters I often found that most modern cars had more responsible drivers than older cars.",

      "text": "It concerns me how much reporting electric cars get in the news where I live compared to news relating to public transit, infrastructure for cyclists/pedestrians etc. For context, I live in a smaller Australian state (about 100,000 people in my city and 500,000 in the state, the only transit we have is busses). \n\nThe crux of the story is always something like \"electric vehicle sales at record high\" or \"new electric charging ports installed in city centre\" and there'll be some person employed in the business talking about the positives of switching from gas to electric, and how the change is \"inevitable\" or \"a step forward\".\n\nI think most here would agree that regardless of what benefits electric cars may have over gas cars, getting more people to walk, bike or use transit in their commutes is far more beneficial for our urban areas and what we should be focused on improving. \n\nWith the regular stories essentially promoting the switch to electric, it scares me that many will believe it's the solution to the problems associated with their car without considering either using or pushing for the improvement of far more beneficial modes of transport. The thinking will be \"Well if it's electric that means it's green and I can keep my commute the same whilst helping the environment.\".\n\nThis isn't to put the blame on individuals, it just frustrates me the message that is being sent with this reporting. I'm not sure what it's like in other countries, though given Australia has a pretty big car culture as America does I'd imagine the reporting is similar in the US (let me know if so).",

Many people argue its due to needing extra space in a car, which I think is absolute rubbish not one person needs a boot (trunk) with more capacity than a freight ship its a terrible excuse as you practivally move a whole house with an SUV boot, SUVs are the most inefficient vehicles on the road with a little 2.5 litre engine trying to pull a monster 2 ton vehicles, just to get an average of 20mpg whilst emissions may be low the waste in fuel (electric or petrol) its astronomically high. Put the same engine in a smaller car and you will see the engine get 40+mpg The only use I can think for SUVs is if you live on a farm but even then you don't want an SUV you want an offroad vehicle. \n\nAnother major issue with these vehicles is that many people do not know how to drive such a goliath vehicle and they are most definitely the most dangerous and erratic drivers on the road as they believe that because they have a big car they own the road, which simply is not true and makes a safe drive feel a lot more dangerous. I definitely think there should be separate licences for driving a bigger car because some people driving these giant vehicles are a danger to the roads.",

You can sue for lost wages, but that's only valid if the other driver was found to be negligent, which is rarely found to be the case. \n\nSo when your family member is killed by a car, there is no accounting for the negative externality that is not having that person in your life anymore. I think insurance should have to pay out for lifetime lost wages using a similar calculation that the 9/11 victims used. They averaged about $2 million, which seems like reasonable compensation to the families that lost a loved one.\n\nThis would help more accurately account for the cost we pay to keep our car dependent system.

      "text": "One of the most under reported forms of pollution has to be light pollution due to several factors. In a vacuum, how is artificial light a problem to humans? Artificial lights don't directly poison the air, gives us comfort and sense of security at night, and help us to see where we're going. What light pollution?\n\nWell, light pollution *does* negatively affect the natural world as bright lights can make prey visible at night, mess up an animals natural nighttime navigation, can confuse birds, etc. Light pollutions can negatively impact humans as well as it may make it harder to sleep at night if they're a bright light that can cause other factors. I won't go into too much detail here as I'm not the most informed on this subject but feel free to read the articles down below.\n\n[https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/causes/](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/causes/)\n\n[https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/human-health/](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/human-health/)\n\n[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13157](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13157)\n\nRather, what I would like to share with you is what *I* believe to be the largest contributor both directly and indirectly to light pollution. And that is, of course, cars!\n\nThink about it! Starting with streetlights, why are they so large and bright? Is it for human navigation and security at nighttime? Well, prior to cars, initial kerosene lamps were rather dim, but they were more than sufficient for human navigation at night.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yyp49qa7lqd1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb47639afb7bbb303ef9d4398bd75d7b7452eb99\n\nAs for why modern electric street lamps are so bright? I don't think it's because it was to deter crime, as the concept of \"Eyes on the Street\" would be better than that as in pedestrianized areas, the lights can be rather dim and are nowhere near as bright as the ones for cars.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vti3o4b97lqd1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7d1dee6762dd17c0e5c20f5da0ac4c830c5dd0a\n\nRather, I firmly believe that the widespread adoption of cars lead to street lamps needing to be brighter to allow for \"safer\" driving at night. And hence, creating an endless cycle of brighter and brighter lights.\n\nNow, while streetlights are prominent in cities and urban areas, many roads, in fact most roads don't have streetlights, meaning that cars have to rely on their *own* headlights to see at night. And I shouldn't have to tell you [how bright modern cars' headlights are](https://globalnews.ca/news/10417509/car-headlight-brightness/) and the various problems that causes. You could say that modern streetlights and headlights are [Blinding Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRXx6U8ABQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4iv8jj0elqd1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b1d7db310d240a06752faadfa98be7b1b6604a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw75gmpzbmqd1.jpg?width=2176&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9316c7ce713352e43c4731ccda6505bc7b3db62c\n\nWith that being said, let me compare what *I* have observed between the headlights of cars, versus those of trains. These are just my personal experiences, but feel free to share your own.\n\nNow, the main metro system that I use nearly everyday and is the most familiar with is the Vancouver SkyTrain in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nWith the newer Mark III Rolling Stock, they feature fancy and new LED headlights. From the outside, they can be spotted rather easily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2e9dsjeflqd1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4da66f82957fd4f9e3a8ea626cecc5f26d11fe5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o9mmtyeflqd1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424f98f8c19a00fac3e62b67953c54e579217f41\n\nBut rest assure, because the SkyTrain is a fully automatic system with no driver onboard, when under automatic operations, when you look out of windshield during nighttime, you can't see sh\\*t.\n\nLike for real, you can barely see the track in front of you while riding a Mark III at night. The older Mark I's and Mark II's have brighter, yellow headlights.\n\nBecause the SkyTrain is fully automatic, there's no need for bright streetlights and headlights, and especially with the Mark III's, during normal automatic operations, only the \"daytime running lights\" are on (the Mark III's have real, regular headlights above the daytime running lights), meaning that most of the route is in the dark.\n\nEven on freight trains that *do* require more visual signaling, their headlights don't seem to be as blinding as a modern car, and there's no need for light poles along the route. And of course with in-cab signaling, there's no need for visual signaling lights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01sfumjwolqd1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1104d62c4438cf7943b941c3cd9c7f82c0f832\n\nAs such, I firmly believe that trains in general, both regular freight trains and fully automatic metro systems produce rather little light pollution compared to road vehicles. And that most of our modern light pollution can somewhat be correlated to cars as while cars aren't the only cause, I *do* believe they're one of the biggest.",

      "text": "This post will attempt to create a comprehensive list of why America's built environment and transportation system is the way it is. I will also explain why some of these things are undoing themselves.\n\n1. Frontier Culture combined with cheap and abundant habitable land - From the beginning of US history there was a desire to move west and find land to settle. One of America's grievances in the revolutionary war was not being able to settle past a certain line the British drew. Once we became independent we had the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican American war and the acquisition of the Pacific northwest. The Transcontinental railroad itself was a vehicle to encourage westward settlement. Pretty much every advance in transportation - the Steamboat, steam railways, the horse drawn streetcar, the electric streetcar, the interurban railway, elevated railways, subways and or course cars all had the effect of encouraging decentralization.  Very few American cities are built around walking, horses and buggies, and water transport the way European Cities were. Asian Countries have had extremely large populations combined with smaller amounts of desirable and habitable land. With recent waves of immigration though populations have tended to concentrate themselves in certain regions. immigration has caused the population of places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Miami and other places to explode. Plus there is the controversial trend of gentrification. See here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u0p770/most\\_of\\_america\\_lives\\_on\\_a\\_small\\_portion\\_of\\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u0p770/most_of_america_lives_on_a_small_portion_of_its/)\n2. Cheap and abundant energy supplies - Cheaper gas prices and electricity prices help to drive urban sprawl ([https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/whats-driving-remarkable-decline-urban-sprawl-in-us/](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/whats-driving-remarkable-decline-urban-sprawl-in-us/)). Urban sprawl requires higher electricity consumption and longer electrical lines ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617318280](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617318280)), which results in greater transmission losses. The United States used to have lots of cheap and abundant conventional oil. Oil was cheaper than water in Texas at one point. Today most oil in North America is expensive unconventional oil, thus to meet demand we have to import it or pay much more for it.  Car culture depends upon cheap gasoline or other forms of fuel for cars. Every time there is a substantial increase in oil or gas prices, sprawl goes down. The current (as of the writing of this post) increase in gas prices might go away after a time, but it is part of a longer term trend. Oil discoveries have been declining ([https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oil-natural-gas-discoveries-worldwide-decline-to-lowest-level-in-75-years/](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oil-natural-gas-discoveries-worldwide-decline-to-lowest-level-in-75-years/)). Oil discoveries peaked around the 1960s. The shale boom which made more recent cheaper oil prices possible is coming to an end and was likely never profitable to begin with ([https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/02/oil-frackers-brace-for-end-of-the-u-s-shale-boom-wsj/](https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/02/oil-frackers-brace-for-end-of-the-u-s-shale-boom-wsj/)). Conventional oil peaked around the mid 2000s and hence why we have seen a boom in fracking, tar sands, and offshore drilling, these are only viable with high prices ([https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/conventional-oil-peaked-in-2008-iea-2013-01-18/rep\\_id:4136](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/conventional-oil-peaked-in-2008-iea-2013-01-18/rep_id:4136)). I would recommend looking up James Howard Kunstler, he is controversial and I myself disagree with him that we lack capital for building rail, but he is undeniably correct about the future of oil. Both people who accept climate change and those who deny it assume upon infinite supplies of abundant hydrocarbons, when empirical evidence is contrary to this. Climate change, while definitely a problem, has served to drown out the reality of peak oil. It's not peak oil, gas and coal will also decline too. Any realistic climate change policy needs to include a decrease in the amount of cars, airplanes and trucking for transportation, per capita energy use and consumption. \n3. Cultural bias against cities and towns - American culture and other Anglo saxon outposts have had a cultural bias against cities and town and always idealized country living. Suburbs were seen as a means of combining the two. Car oriented suburbs effectively combine the two, while making both worse in the process. Aside from culture, some cities were beginning to have quality of life issues, such as New York with its tenement buildings. interestingly there is now a roughly even split in the desire for walkability vs more space among the US public ([https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/06/13/pew-survey-liberals-want-walkability-conservatives-want-a-big-lawn/](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/06/13/pew-survey-liberals-want-walkability-conservatives-want-a-big-lawn/)).\n4. Individualism - this should go without saying , but Americans and other Anglo-Saxon countries are hyper-individualist and hate anything that involves contact with other people or sharing with other people. Cars and sprawl embody this to the maximum degree possible and is one reason why people often do not even know their neighbors. \n5. White flight/redlining/urban renewal - I think this point is overemphasized - but white flight and racism, were and to some extent still are factors. Gentrification is reversing this to some extent. To what extent white flight was caused by irrational prejudice towards blacks and to what extent it was caused by legitimate concerns about crime and quality of life (see Detroit riots) is hard to quantify. On the one hand white flight caused urban areas to be gutted, but many cities had riots and people were concerned about their safety. interestingly the policy of \"forced busing\" where the Federal Government attempted to forcibly integrate schools via busing black children to white schools was only done in urban schools, but not suburban ones according \"Crabgrass Frontier\".  There was also public housing and urban renewal that caused urban areas to decline in quality and poverty to be concentrated. Many beautiful buildings were torn down to make way for uglier modern ones (a video on urban renewal: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PydFzWfkdOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PydFzWfkdOw)). I address this here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u8z9d3/my\\_thoughts\\_on\\_white\\_flight\\_suburbia\\_and\\_racism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u8z9d3/my_thoughts_on_white_flight_suburbia_and_racism/)\n6. Ultra high living standards - The period from the 1920s - 1970s, with the exception of the depression and WW2, was basically the most prosperous generation of people in human history and unlikely to be repeated. Resource limits will prevent any nation from ever having that level of wealth, as everyone having American living standards would require several additional planets ([https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/#:\\~:text=Here's%20how%20we%20calculate%20that,if%20everyone%20lived%20like%20Americans](https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/#:~:text=Here's%20how%20we%20calculate%20that,if%20everyone%20lived%20like%20Americans).). In the 1950s we had 35% of workers unionized ([https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22union.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22union.html)), 50% of the world's manufacturing vs today where it is being outsourced ([https://60dayusa.com/posts/what-happened-to-the-u-s-manufacturing-industry/](https://60dayusa.com/posts/what-happened-to-the-u-s-manufacturing-industry/)), and real wages peaked in the 1970s ([https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)), coincidentally the time when the oil crisis happened and cars were least fuel efficient. Single family home ownership and sprawl correlates with incomes too, and unionized workers are more likely to own homes \"In 2006, about two-thirds of American families own their dwellings, a proportion which rises to three-fourths of AFLCIO union members\".  Car ownership corresponds with higher incomes ([https://www.sightline.org/2011/11/28/more-money-more-cars/](https://www.sightline.org/2011/11/28/more-money-more-cars/)) ([https://voxeu.org/article/new-measure-global-middle-class](https://voxeu.org/article/new-measure-global-middle-class)), and several have pointed to low Indian car ownership, but this is in a part a result of their low standards of living. Unfortunately the trend is towards lower incomes and people are struggling. Roughly 50 percent of Americans make 30,000 or less ([https://www.business2community.com/us-news/half-of-americans-make-less-than-30000-per-year-01369249](https://www.business2community.com/us-news/half-of-americans-make-less-than-30000-per-year-01369249)).",

      "title": "\u001cI\u0019m sick and tired of the same excuses drivers come up with to continue burning gasoline and on a warming planet\u001d - A Fix It Post",
      "text": "I was initially going to parody the post by someone with a post of the same name, but then I decided to actually be constructive and propose some reasonable, non-preachy answers to the guy\u0019s excuses.\n\nTo preface though, any actions one takes alone will mean nothing without collective action, especially with those outside this subreddit and are at best lukewarm to a future not dominated by cars. \n\n\"My emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d\n\nThis is true, but that doesn\u0019t reduce our personal responsibility. This mindset is a killer of positive change in many areas, voting and littering as examples. We can\u0019t stop the bad individually, but we can reduce the harm.\n\nMake sure to stay involved in all levels of government though. If there\u0019s something local to you pumping out emissions, chances are they have to deal with some level of your local government, and you can influence that too, especially if you\u0019re part of a group.\n\n\"I can't afford an electric car.\"\n\nHave you looked into federal subsidies? They can help bring the price down as a customer.\n\nThere are other options though. Hybrids are a decent middle ground, plenty of used ones out there at this point. Try to use the battery as often as you can. \n\n\"I don't have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\"\n\nHave you sat down and tried to plot out a public transit or bike route to/from work? It could be better than you think.\n\nIf public transit is prohibitive due to infrequent appearances or prohibitive travel times, try car pooling with co-workers. It\u0019s still a car on the road, but in total it\u0019s at least one less car that needs to go to/from your work place.\n\n\"Driving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\"\n\nHow significant is the time? If it\u0019s less than 15 more minutes each way, is it really that much better? \n\nIf it\u0019s an hour\u0019s difference or you need to get to another job soon after, then that\u0019s a pass.\n\n\"There's no infrastructure to bike where I live.\"\n\nThat can\u0019t be helped in the moment. High speed roads are especially dangerous to bikers even without assholes gunning for you and you shouldn\u0019t risk your life daily for an intangible future.\n\nTry to find likeminded folk though and pressure whatever local governments to address this need for the community.\n\n\"My workplace is out of reach of biking\ndistance.\"\n\nAforementioned carpooling and plotting public transit routes. \n\nSee if it\u0019s possible to bring a bike with you on public transit to fill in gaps on your trips/make it so you don\u0019t have to bike the whole way.\n\nYou can also try asking to work from home, if it\u0019s an option at your workplace and role.\n\n\"I'm too weak to bike.\"\n\nIf you can\u0019t bike for whatever health reasons, then what you need to do to survive is not your fault. Causing yourself to suffer daily for an intangible goal is only going to worsen both your physical and mental health.\n\nAgain though, look into carpooling. A car off the road for whatever reason is a car not creating emissions or at risk of causing an accident\n\n\"I can't carry my groceries on a bike.\"\n\nThere are carriages that can be purchased and towed by a bicycle.\n\nAlternatively, try to line up multiple errands to be done at once and purchase non-perishable items in bulk to reduce your overall number of car trips. Making a list of what you need/are running low on can really help with this.\n\n\"I can't ride a bike in the cold.\"\n\nTry layering up, but don\u0019t kill yourself trying to make it work. There\u0019s a reason there are days we\u0019re told we shouldn\u0019t drive in X weather conditions, and bikes are more susceptible to the whims of the weather.\n\n\"Not everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\"\n\nIt doesn\u0019t have to be a traditional bike. There are other electric or man powered personal vehicles with additional wheels for stabilization.\n\n\"I don't like waiting for the bus.\"\n\nSee the aforementioned carpooling and plotting of a route. \n\nAlso, there are ways to keep ourselves entertained alone now.\n\nAgain, if it\u0019s a significant burden on your time due to public transit being poor, then do what you have to do. Just be sure to take action where you can to rectify it rather than wallow in the misfortune.\n\n\"I don't like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d\n\nAnother fair reason. Germaphobia, claustrophobia, or just a general unease or fear of strangers is a reasonable reason not to take public transit. Do be sure to investigate all your other options before resigning yourself to a personal car though.\n\n\"How can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\"\n\nSee the aforementioned question on the grocery store.\n\n\n\nWe all here know the climate of Earth is changing fast in ways that are unfavorable to life as it currently exists. Radical action needs to be taken to avert the worst effects. Significant changes need to be forced from the top, and society\u0019s not going to go cold turkey on cars tomorrow, but there are a lot of small things that can be done to address the issue, especially when we take action collectively. \n\nWe\u0019re only going to get other people to work with us if we listen and genuinely address their concerns, rather than dismissing them as excuses. We\u0019re not personal trainers, they aren\u0019t coming to us for help; we\u0019re coming to them and so we need to speak on their terms.\n\nEdited to remove a name.",

We own a pool cleaning business  and work together so unless we change careers we will always have a vehicle for work. \n\nThis year I got an electric bike and have been  absolutely loving it. With that addition to our transportation lineup I was able to convince my wife to (temporarily) go down to only one vehicle. We sold our car last month to take advantage of the used car market that is supposed to slow down this winter with the idea in mind that we will save up money and buy a new car before summer. I have been half messing with and half serious telling my wife that instead of buying a 2nd vehicle, we will sell our current extended cab Nissan frontier for either a SUV that can tow a trailer for work or a similar sized 4 door truck. She always just rolls her eyes and says that we need 2 vehicles for this or that. I am going to use this winter to show her that we can manage with one vehicle and a little extra planning/communication to make sure we don't overlap on times we need the truck. I also plan on getting trailers for my bike to allow me to go get groceries/carry things to big for a backpack when needed. Hopefully a bike for my wife is in the near future too. \n\nIs there anyone that went through a similar transition and can give some pointers/insight on how you managed your schedule to make one vehicle work?

Thus, it is in one's longterm interest not to operate a motor vehicle, which contributes more to environmental devastation than any other single consumer item. But we have an immediate need for transportation in order to get to work, or do whatever else needs doing, so most of us have no choice except to own and use automobiles.\n\nThe \"car culture\" demonstrates how the ecological crisis is not primarily an individual matter of man soiling his own nest. In most instances, the \"choice\" of using a car is no choice at all. Ecologically efficient and less costly electric-car mass transportation has beendeliberately destroyed since the 1930s in campaigns waged across the country by the automotive, oil, and tire industries.

There\u0019s a lot of talk about infrastructure change but what about smaller personal and achievable changes that people can make? Here\u0019s some that I practice:\n\n1. Live within walking distance of a supermarket, no shops and I won\u0019t live there.\n\n2. Live within walking distance of work. I get a job and I look for houses either within walking distance or on a direct bus route. It\u0019s not always easy but, if it comes down to it, I\u0019ll reject the job.\n\n3. Buy or rent  somewhere that has a direct bus or train service to the city centre. That way you can link to the national train system and get pretty much anywhere.\n\n4. Don\u0019t buy  or help to buy your kids driving lessons or a car no matter what they say. The cost involved must be their choice. I didn\u0019t and none of mine have chosen to drive.\n\n5. If you choose to live in the country away from facilities then learn to disassociate from them, grow your own food, join others and use one vehicle to drive into town to shop for all, work from home.\n\n6. Walk wherever you can. Walking is great. It\u0019s a great achievement to spend all day walking to another town, having a bite to eat and walking back again.\n\nI know that our leaders have sold our cities to the automobile industry and some of this seems unachievable for many but it should be what we work towards. Not just swapping the petrol car for an electric one but dumping the thing that enslaves you altogether.",

They use twice as much energy for the same range as a smaller car. \n\nSomething I also found while researching this mess is that particulate air pollution from tyre wear is already worse than tailpipe emissions in Europe. \n\nI would be surprised if electric pickups weren't actively worse for the environment than regular ICE or hybrid versions because of how inefficient they are, how many minerals they require, and how much more tyre wear they cause from the extra weight. \n\nIt's a little frustrating that EVs (specifically SUVs and trucks) are being pushed and even funded by the government as a green solution. I feel like it might distract from the bigger issue, which is that cars and car-centrism are unsustainable as a whole.",

      "text": "Flemish municipalities will soon be allowed to install fixed speed cameras and trajectory speed controls on bicycle streets. This was decided by the Flemish regional government, Het Nieuwsblad reported on Monday.\n\nThe speed limit in cycling zones or 'bicycle streets' is 30 kilometres per hour, and cars, mopeds or high-speed e-bikes are not allowed to overtake cyclists. In reality, however, this speed limit often seems to be a dead letter, as speeding in a cycling zone can only be detected by police officers on the spot.\n\nThis is why it will soon be possible to use unmanned speed cameras or trajectory speed controls (which measure the average speed of a vehicle over a certain distance, ed.). \"With this adaptation of the rules, we are giving municipalities and police zones more and better possibilities to enforce the speed limit in cycling zones efficiently,\" says Flemish Mobility minister Lydia Peeters.\n\nGrowing popularity\nPeeters announced in April that she wants to see more than 30 per cent of journeys in the region made by bicycle by 2040. In Belgium as a whole, cycling has become increasingly popular in recent years, according to figures from the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility (FPS Mobility).\n\nAccording to the FPS Mobility, at the beginning of 2023, cycling was the main mode of transport for 14.1 per cent of Belgian commuters, compared to 7.8 per cent in 2005 and 11.1 per cent in 2017. No other mode of transport in Flanders, Wallonia or Brussels has grown more strongly over the years. The rise of electric bikes and speed pedelecs is partly responsible for this growing popularity.\n\nAlong with the steep rise in popularity of cycling, the death toll among cyclists reached an all-time high in 2022.",

      "text": "Welcome to Auto &amp; Auto dealership! How may I help you today? What kind of car you are looking after? I can guarantee all of our cars are great, you just need to choose! So it seems like you like that used compact hatchback there! That's not a bad choice if you are a beginner or some old man! You know right? This is the thing you drive as a starter until you are ready for the real thing! You know to be honest this car sucks! It's only a 1.4 liter engine and well, I just drank that amount of Pepsi this morning. Don't be a wussy, how could you overtake with this weak engine? It's dangerous to be with this thing at all times. Don't listen to others about body weight/horsepowers nonsense, it's still just a 1.4 what can't accelerate properly. \n   \nSo can we get to the real deal now? Well, we have trucks and trucks and trucks and moooore trucks! That's plenty you can choose from. Please ignore that room with the other compacts and full size sedans and combis because our SUVs and Trucks has just the same driver assistant systems installed! And how else could be the king on the roads if you don't have the largest vehicle under you? What the family would call you if you were about to stuff them into a VW Golf? After five miles they will beg you to let them free because 4 people barely got any space!  \n  \nImagine being on a date and you arrive to your girlfriend's house with this crap! You can honk as many as you want she will not see you from her windows it's so small. She would probably think that it's just some maniac being horn...playing with the horns. But if you want to be single forever you can still choose that car! We entering into grownups territory with this huge, factory lifted 6 seater truck! See how comfy is it? The cabin section only is as long as that lame compact, how can it be not comfortable? You can see every peasant from above! Let me ask you something! Are you into boating? So no. Because you look like about 10-15 years away from midlife crisis so soon you will be! This car will tow not one, not two but three boats at the same time! And even if you are an old geezer who can't drive don't worry! We have an autopilot system which recognizes pedestrians as trashcans just how you will do after you get this truck!  \n  \nWhat will you use your car for? Umm so getting to work, doing groceries and visiting friends? Well, this truck is ideal for that! To be honest any car could do that but what if.. what if.. What if your friends are moving and you need to help them moving furnitures? They will be struggling with the furniture moving services or a rental truck that costs a lot! You hate your friends or why don't you want to help them? What if some emergency happens to your family? Imagine your grandma moving to an ultra-rural places with dirt roads only. How would you visit her without a truck suitable for off-roads? What if they fire you and you only can find a job in a construction site? You need to transfer machinery to the site, right? So many cases could happen when you need a truck and if you don't have you lose friends, family, jobs, etc.  \n  \nTalking about engine options we got the sucker 2.0, the also sucker 3.0 6 cylinders and the AWESOME 5.8 LITERS V8 ENGINE WITH ENOUGHT POWER TO TOW THE ENTIRE LAKE! WHY WOULD YOU TRANSPORT YOUR BOATS WHEN YOU CAN TRANSPORT THE ENTIRE LAKE TO YOUR HOUSE? IT SKYROKETS WHEN THE LIGHTS SWITCH TO GREEN LEAVING (old) SUPERCARS IN THE DUST! IT'S OUR BEST SELLING PRODUCT so probably you will be left in dust at the green too. Also an electric version is incoming. I can subscribe you to a list so you can get your electric truck when it arrives to the store making african sla..proudly working kids in the lithium mines proud.  \n  \nSo.. you still want that 1.4 compact? Did you even listen to me? Your life sucks and it will suck more if you don't buy a REAL VEHICLE LIKE A MAN! You will die in 7 days if you don't buy the truck! Send a message to 5 of your friends about how trucks are awesome if you don't want your parents dead!  \n  \n-so yeah this was obviously a satire about how the unneccessarily huge cars get sold not by car salesmen but by families and friends making a huge demand for such cars.",

      "text": "E Rickshaws are now everywhere. Here is Jeff himself driving one of these E rickshaws : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2onRQXgojo\n\nAs an Indian living in India, the 'need' for car doesnt really make sense. Within 1 km (0.6 mi) of my house, I have literally  hundreds of shops - grocery / barber / restaurants / cycle repair / doctor's clinic / cafe / milk booth / even imported swiss chocolates.\n\nSince the last 2 years, online delivery of groceries have really ramped up. These delivery boys (of amazon or local company) use escooters or erickshaws to deliver everything.\n\nUber / Ola is cheaper than owning a car (insurance / maintaince / fuel). I hire a rickshaw anyway through these apps.\n\nTrain network is well developed, more electrified than EU / US, and bullet train network is under construction. Local Metro trains are currently operational in 15 cities : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oToAoQvi4Ns\n\nErickshaws are a game changer. These are 2000 USD / 25kmph 3 wheelers which usually carry 4-6 passengers / cargo in dense neighbourhoods. There are more than 5 million of these All India : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqVIjKNdjC8\n\nThis has created well paying jobs for atleast 5 million families along with robust Indian manufacturing for these. Also reducing the need for millions of personal scooters (usually petrol).\n\nAn Indian startup Ola (now a 10B USD+ company) has created world's largest 2 wheeler Electric Scooter plant, taking bookings online : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKhkE0AuJ0\n\nMajor cities are getting electric buses : https://www.electrive.com/2022/03/08/olectra-delivers-150-electric-buses-to-pune/\n\nCars are a huge waste of metal / batteries / space / energy. For travelling within city, they are much more expensive than Uber / Ola apps or erickshaws. For travelling from one city to another, they are quite slow (compared to trains).\n\nAll electric vehicles need a minimum running everyday to break-even with a petrol vehicle. Delivery guys travel a lot, and EVs help reduce massive pollution and fuel bills.\n\n2022 is another lesson why we should move away from petrol / diesel. No more funding crazy dictators. But the shift should be towards Electric public infra, not electric cars.\n\nFeel free to ask anything stupid haha.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI had a daydream in the shower and then during my 30 mile (ugh) commute up the M1 in England today, where my brain pretty much created a new policy that might help reverse the trend in megacars/freedumb trucks/whatever you want to call them. Going to set it out, please let me know what you think. \n\nFirstly, I am in no way a policymaker, I work in planning, I drive to work, I hate it (used to cycle in London but now I am in the provinces, I have to drive) \n\nSecondly, if something like this exists in the UK already, please say. Or even if this exists in your country, then please let me know! \n\nAnyway: \n\n**Vehicle Weight Tax** (could also be dubbed **Pollution Tax** to be snappy, but it's a misnomer)\n\nStudies are done to find what an \"acceptable\" weight for new cars is. For the sake of setting this out, I'm using the 1500kg kerb weight of an above-average spec Skoda Octavia Estate - a large-ish vehicle by European Standards, plenty of room for a family of four/five. \n\nAny car sold new (of which there were over 1.9million new vehicle registrations in the UK in 2023) has a tax applied to the list price of £10 for every Kilogram over the designated limit for an ICE vehicle (even if hybrid). \n\nFor example, a top of the range Skoda Octavia Estate fully loaded with kit could be up to 1547kg. The list price of this will be pretty high already, but it attracts a £**470** surcharge. \n\nAnother example, the lightest model of the BMW X7 is 2490kg. This would attract a surcharge of (checks calculator) £**9900** on the list price. I feel this would act as a deterrent to some, and be a morally just charge for others who still opt for such vehicles. \n\nThis is payable either at the point of purchase if buying cash (at which point it becomes the dealership's responsibility to pay the correct amount of tax just as they would with VAT). However, instead of going into a big tax pot and swirled around, it is ringfenced as a budget designed to help with Active Travel (a super underfunded thing in the UK) or green energy projects, or pedestrian safety etc. \n\nIf the car is paid on finance, then the finance company has this responsibility. The tax can be included in the finance deal, but would not be allowed to have interest applied by the finance company. \n\nApplications and Exemptions: \n\n* Electric vehicles (needs a different approach, but could still apply elements of it. Removing tax breaks for electric, but taxing non-electric shofts the burden of change onto the consumer and manufacturers, rather than allowing governments to part-fund it)\n* Goods vehicles, or anything not in the Passenger car class - I'm specifically targeting private passenger vehicles and trucks\n* There may be very few limited exceptions where this tax wouldn't apply, but this is reviewed on application by the customer after the purchase, and reimbursed through rebate. No buying it then battling HMRC (IRS for Americans)  just to avoid the tax. \n\nSecond hand cars\n\n* While I realise this might lead to a boom in second hand SUVs, I would still apply the same rules but at a lower rate. In the UK you have to send off your V5C with the new keeper's details. \n* At the point of re-registering the car, it attracts a tax bill of £1 per kg over. The BMW in the above example would still have to pay a £990 fee for purchase. This could be absorbed into the cost when buying second hand from dealer (they take care of it for the customer) but when buying privately, it would attract an automatically generated tax demand from HMRC (IRS). \n\nAvoidance via imports\n\n* the UK has strict vehicle import laws, at which point if someone was purchasing a vehicle in South Africa (same side of the road) and importing to the UK, then the same tax would apply. \n\n60% of the new vehicle sales in the UK in 2023 were SUVs, suggesting that if £5000 might be able to be raised from each of these sales, we might be generating upwards of £5bn per year in extra taxes. \n\nThats kind of it, there wasn't a lot of point to me writing this here, unless any of you are lawmakers in your various countries! Please pick holes in it as I genuinely might pitch it to my local MP. \n\nThank you for listening",

      "text": "Yesterday I needed to travel during rush hour and of course I took a car because public transport is non-existent and I would need to change 3 or more times. Because of fire smoke (thanks climate change) I could not use bike.\n\nCalifornia tried to implement 'public transport' by encouraging carpooling - personally I dislike this as carpooling requires coordinating with someone your schedule and if you do that you still need to somehow get groceries and whatnot. There is special lane on many roads and highways you can use if you have 2 or more people in car or have an electric vehicle (hybrid count).\n\nHaving nothing better to do I started observing people on carpool lane passing me by. Some cars had 2 people or more or had a label declaring them \"green\" but many didn't. I started thinking if such lane is a good use of resources. First I thought about cycle path but it would probably not be very nice to ride with so much car exhaust.\n\nThan I imagined that instead of lane there would be a light rail along highway. You could have stops at regular intervals when you can disembark on the roads passing above. I could just bike to station over highway, embark a tram and quickly pass all the cars stuck in traffic jam. We could do it on most highways having 2+ lanes creating a relatively dense network of rail without need to buy land.\n\nAlas, it will never happen but girl can dream...",

They are also extremely convenient because they have a trolly handle (like a suitcase), and their compact size. I can put mine under my desk without needing to worry about someone stealing it. There are other personal electric vehicles but non are as versatile, fun, or as convenient as an electric unicycle.",

      "title": "Did You See the Car-Free New York City? - Westworld Season 4, Episode 1.",
      "text": "ATTN: I WILL NOT BE SPOILING OR DISCUSSING WESTWORLD PLOTS IN THIS POST OR THREAD (don't panic)\n\nI have my opinions about Westworld and the direction the story is going but those opinions are for me and I am not going to drag anyone for their opinions of the show. That being said I generally enjoy the plot of HBO's Westworld and I'm not interested in getting into it with anyone online about it.\n\nI have attached pictures for reference and I don't think they are spoilers. Most of this was in the trailer anyway.\n\nSo why is Westworld r/fuckcars?\n\nSeason 4 premiered last Sunday and I am a bit surprised that I haven't seen much discussion here or in many subreddits about its depiction of a near-future city that **is free of cars**. In this thread, I will refer to it as New York City because it was pretty obviously filmed in that city. I have visited NYC a few times and each time I have walked along the Highline, a repurposed above-street central rail line turned  walkable path and community greenspace, that takes you above the loud and busy streets of NYC around Chelsea and the Meatpacking District.  Episode 1 of this season uses that location for a few scenes to establish this greener, more walkable, car-free city.\n\nBecause we don't know the plot's setting is NYC, this is not a spoiler. Thank you.\n\n[The Highline really looks like this. You can see it like this today.](https://preview.redd.it/okb7vnnag2991.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc32294e3ba24f5e3d749272aef5de4ae3f19570)\n\nIf you haven't been on the Highline, go check it out if you are in New York City: [https://www.thehighline.org/](https://www.thehighline.org/)\n\nI have mixed feeling about New York City. It's fun to visit but bothersome and exhausting to navigate. It's modern and shiny but utterly disgusting. And, NYC is dense and functioning but too dense and wasteful at the same time. But most of all, it is loud. NYC is so loud all of the time. Most of that noise comes from cars and traffic. A constant sound of honking engines and the wheel and road noise of both small vehicles and large trucks alike. in that part of Manhattan, there are also many street that predate automobiles and as such are narrow and winding and sharing those streets while on foots with the constant stream of cars and SUVs is unpleasant. I don't know how to feel when it is described as one of the world's great cities. I don't think it's a great city in 2022. It's just big and famous and Seinfeld was set there.\n\nThe New York City in Westworld Season 4 is **quiet**. In that world, care has been taken to make the residential areas of the city more hospitable. Immediately, you can see that the streets that the residential buildings reside on have had the roads replaced with walking paths, benches, grass, and plant gardens. These neighborhoods have a real calm vibe. There a little cafes, outdoor seating, and people milling about everywhere but since the space between buildings are not 70% dedicated to automobiles, it's not crowded with pedestrians. Nice a walkable and everyone if freely moving around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The converted street turned neighborhood pedestrian pathway.](https://preview.redd.it/22iq2hm0f2991.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48c90d18c4b100495a01bd41bc327f8a4820e7ea)\n\n[Look at that dude playing games on his iPad. ](https://preview.redd.it/29om4nbvf2991.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=419ead0fe19ca6188f8d07cbcb23974a1f84e69f)\n\nThe streets in these neighborhoods are even made more comfortable by the prevention of light pollution at night around where people live and sleep. This neighborhood in particular is surrounded by other buildings but there are few lights on the buildings themselves needlessly illuminating the outdoors. The lights on the ground are almost entirely at street level with no exterior lighting above the first story of these home. There are interesting streetlights that illuminate as you approach and turn off after you walk past so that they do not cast more light than needed. The pathways are still pretty well lit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qusk3dbpg2991.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e43d5aa884b9d2f1a8cee1f40bb3bffb9932648b\n\nThe makers of this show eliminated the highways and freeways in the establishing shots of this New York City.  They depict a NYC with dense, residential, low-rise buildings filling in the scars left behind by the paths freeways took through city. Take a look at the establishing shots of the city. You will see greenery peppered across the otherwise glass and concrete city scape. It may seem to be a rosy greenwashing of a megacity, but I would argue that is is probably the image of society in the midst of a change. The air is clearly not perfect and they seem to be adapting to a changing world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[In the bottom right you can see that former path of a major roadway is now full of small buildings and green-space walkways](https://preview.redd.it/0d22xghne2991.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c15f10544141c6539f74308959b57cc6d6df3e6c)\n\nBUT THERE ARE CARS IN THAT EPISODE I SAW THEM! you are screaming at me. There are roads too. In these scenes, we see at least a few narrow paved roadways with a few boxy, white, autonomous, 4 wheeled carriages moving along as though they were cars. And you would be right, except that these have no doors and are in fact, autonomous rideshare carriages that look like they have space for both seated and standing passengers. They are much like a trolley, but with the flexibility of a bus line. You can even see where they park and charge when they are not in use. And note that it is just the white carriages in that solar charging depot. There are no personally owned automobiles in this city that we can see. \n\n(...that we can see yet, ok?...)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A solar charging station for our autonomous, electric carriages.](https://preview.redd.it/nbns1jszh2991.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622612f55ebc2bcd1c0575dc43b7b9d7cf2a52e6)\n\nAnyway, I think this show is doing a good job of imagining what a car-free NYC could actually look like. Yes, it is a NYC that is unnaturally overly clean and polished and everyone is monochromatic and serious but as far as effective urban re-imagining goes, This episode of this show is worth a peek.\n\nIF YOU MADE IT THIS FAR PLEASE KNOW THIS:  \nIf you think that my discussing green spaces and walking paths in a fictional city is spoiling the plot of a silly sci-fi show and all you can contribute to this discussion are those complaints, then make like a car and have a breakdown about it on your own personal time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of this depiction? Is it inspiring? \n\nWhat you would take from this into your own community? Where are you seeing transformations like this implemented today?",

      "text": "I know it sounds ridiculous, but if such a vehicle exists I would get one. Why?\n\nWe all know the cons of cars, but for me the biggest one is cost. Owning a car is extremely expensive, especially for someone who has no job (like me currently) or just a minimum wage job. Every month you have to pay tax and insurance, even if you dont drive. Fuel is also expensive, so whether you drive alot or not drive at all, its a waste of money either way.\n\nBut not gonna lie, when its winter and -5C and cold wet snow is blowing in my face, and my hands are freezing to death even though im wearing gloves, I tend to get jealous of all the car drivers I see around me, knowing they are perfectly comfortable in their cars.\n\nBut getting a car is obviously a no for me.\n\nSo I wish that there is a bike with doors and a roof around it, maybe it could even become more aerodynamic letting you go faster, if its an ebike then the weight doesnt matter. If 3 or 4 wheels are needed for this then so be it... Atleast there is no engine capable of 120 km/h which legally forces you to pay a shit load of tax and insurance every month. Since its still a bike, you dont have to pay tax and insurance. If its an ebike, a little bit of electricity is much much cheaper than fuel for cars.\n\nThere are already vehicles similar to this, however they have a motor capable of 25 or 45 or 80 km/h, and so they require to be insured, which i cannot afford. Not to mention the price of the vehicle itself.\n\nSo I want an actual bike like this. Why isnt there one\n\nIf they existed it would also take away one argument that drivers have for driving their car",

      "text": "I recently had to privilege to talk to a worker representing our public bus system in my city. All the buses in the city are either trolley cable-powered, or hybrid-electric. The city is planning on going fully battery-powered electric by 2035, with minimal expansion of trolley buses. When I asked the representative why, she said it was because the infrastructure of trolley buses is difficult to install and maintain, and people don\u0019t like the look of the wires above the cables. So I guess my question is while an electric bus is better than a fossil fuel run bus, and any bus is more sustainable than a car, there still arises the issue of mining for lithium being very unsustainable, and usually unethical. Is there anyway I could advocate for the city to expand more trolley bus lines, or does anyone know of more ethical and sustainable way to produce batteries for vehicles?",

      "text": "Imagine if privately owned cars are phased out, and everyone not needing a car for their work get there by walking, bike or public transport. Would this work towards fulfilling the sustainable development goals formulated by UN? Let's look at the most obvious ones:\n\n**3 Good health and well-being**\n\nRemoving cars from the road, even electric ones, will contribute to an improvement of air quality (less smog, but also dust), which improves living conditions, particularly for people with respiratory conditions. More walking and biking will also contribute to reducing obesity, and road accidents would be greatly reduced.\n\n**7 Affordable and clean energy**\n\nThe main point here is the reduction of energy requirements, such that countries that use a mix of fossil and renewable energy sources can outphase the former and use the latter to power public transit.\n\n**9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure**\n\nA transition to smart and efficient collective transit systems requires a lot of innovation and deployment of infrastructure. We won't solve it, I would rather say that removing cars would make this goal even more important.\n\n**10 Reduced inequalities**\n\nIn the category of financial inequalities, more focus on public transport, (ideally heavily subsidized) would even out the playing field for people with respect to how they get around.\n\n**11 Sustainable cities and communities**\n\nThis is what the sub is all about: Creating liveable cities with minimized negative effect on the surrounding environment. Need I say more?\n\n**12 Responsible consumption and production**\n\nMost countries in Europe have automobiles, their parts, or oil/gas as their main export articles. This is by no means responsible production. Tremendous amounts of resources (metal, plastics, rare minerals for batteries, etc.) would be spared. Also, with most/all vehicles owned by people who know what they are doing, the vehicles would be well maintained and have extensive program for recycling of parts.\n\n**13 Climate action**\n\nThis one is mainly about making those in control implement policies (like the banishing of cars), but indirectly, we could focus on other issues now that cars are out of the picture.\n\n**14 Life below water**\n\nTires in motion on asphalt is a huge contributer to microplastics ending up in the sea. Let's stop putting it there.\n\n**15 Life on land**\n\nParking lots and long stretches of highways could be dismantled and turned into meadows and forests where dwindling wildlife populations could thrive.\n\nGoals 1,2,4,5,6,8,16,17 are only affected in minor/indirect ways as I see it, but comments on these are welcome.\n\nI would argue that the global banishment of private cars would be one of the most effective single actions for fulfilling UN's goals. Maybe side by side with efficient lab growth of all kinds of food in conjunction with repurposing most farmland as forests. It remains to be seen which is most realistic.",

      "title": "Proximity to electric vehicle charging stations positively impacts home values",
      "text": "More space wasted in cities for cars, which, of course will drive up the cost of housing, especially dense housing.\n\n-------------\n\nURL: https://www.uri.edu/news/2023/01/proximity-to-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-positively-impacts-home-values/\n\n## New study shows home values rise up to 5.8% \n\nKINGSTON, R.I. \u0013 Jan. 30, 2023 \u0013 A new study finds that proximity to electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) can raise property values depending on where homes are situated. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Rhode Island, the University of Maryland College Park, Princeton University and Cardiff University, was recently published in Nature Sustainability.\n\nRelying on actual market prices of approximately 14 million housing transactions between 1993 and 2021 in the state of California, and combining that with EVCS data, researchers found the greatest effect on the value of homes located between 0.4 to 0.5 kilometers of EVCSs. Compared to those not in proximity to EVCSs, homes within 1 kilometer of EVCSs are valued approximately 3.3% higher (or $17,212). Homes located within 0.4 to 0.5 kilometers found the greatest impact, with a 5.8% increase in home value over homes not in proximity. Homes within 0.3 kilometers did not show a statistically significant impact to home value.  \nPengfei Liu, assistant professor of environmental and resource economics at URI\u0019s College of the Environment and Life Sciences. (URI Photo)\n\n\u001cThis research is really the first of its kind examining public attitudes toward this new type of energy infrastructure,\u001d said Pengfei Liu, URI assistant professor of environmental and resource economics, and an author on the study. \u001cBased on what we are seeing in terms of housing prices and what consumers are willing to pay as part of these transactions, we can infer that there is public support for EV charging stations. When you look at property values for those homes within similar proximity to a gas station \u0013 this is not the case.\u001d\n\nHowever, additional public charging stations are not without their drawbacks, says Lucy Qiu, associate professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland College Park, and one of the lead authors on the study. While this is still a relatively new area of research, the team conducted analyses of air quality and traffic flow. Results show the installation of charging stations increases annual traffic by 0.3% and peak month traffic by 0.5%.\n\n\u001cWe also found reduced air pollution,\u001d said Qiu, noting the analysis showed that air pollutant concentrations decreased by 1.3-2.2%. \u001cThis positive environmental impact could help explain why \u0013 despite increased traffic flows \u0013 we saw no statistically significant effect on the property values of homes within 0.3 kilometers of a charging station when we might otherwise have expected values to decline.\u001d\n\nWith close to 20% of California residents living in multi-family housing, researchers recognize those residents may be more likely to pay a higher premium for public EVCSs vs. single-family homeowners with off-street parking. However, they add that public chargers may also be of benefit to single-family homeowners as an alternative when home chargers fail, when drivers need fast charging immediately or as a substitute due to faster charging capabilities.\n\nDespite California being a leader in terms of electric vehicle sales, researchers believe the study results are an early indication of where the market will go.\n\n\u001cOur goal is to provide policymakers and potential investors with the information necessary to make an informed decision when it comes to this type of infrastructure,\u001d said Qiu. \u001cTraditionally, there has not been a strong incentive to invest in electric vehicle charging stations \u0013 but our research shows beyond providing positive benefits for the environment, there is also a positive impact on home values, providing a return for public and private investors.\u001d\n\nGiven the growing popularity of electric vehicles, and the likelihood of more affordable models and a rising number of used vehicles coming on the market, charging infrastructure becomes increasingly important for low- and middle-income communities.\n\n\u001cWe\u0019ve learned a great deal that could be helpful in terms of the economic and policy implications of charging stations and where they are located,\u001d Liu added. \u001cPreviously charging stations were built primarily where there was high demand while ignoring the economic side effects. Our research finds, on average, there is a positive economic effect \u0013 but the effect varies depending on exact location and demographics. Our hope is that the research provides some guidance and is instructive for policy makers when it comes to locating charging stations and maximizing external economic benefits.\u001d",

I know nothing about electric vehicles or battery capacity, but I guessed that a bus would require a similar battery size to a tractor trailer, and that they\u0019d need to be charged frequently like compact EVs do. Bus routes rely on consistency, so wouldn\u0019t it be problematic to take buses out of commission a couple of times a day so they could be charged at a charging station?

      "text": "As we discuss the ways culture and infrastructure impact public safety and the environment, I think it's important to remember the way details exist in layers of context. Sometimes I find myself so fixated on my local infrastructure and certain subsets of motorists that I forget that the details are wrapped in multiple layers of context. \n\nI came across some poignant criticism of the cultural context surrounding the Cybertruck. It would seem from Craighton's point of view that motonormativity and motobesity are fueled by a culture of self absorption, machismo, and xenophobia and a society beholden to the whims of billionaires and oligarchs. Many of you have said as much, but I thought his way of putting it was worth sharing.\n\nSome of my favorite points were:\n\n* Safety inside vehicles is prioritized over safety outside.\n* People project their brashness and machismo through their vehicles.\n* The rich mistakenly think they can buy their way out of social and environmental dystopia.\n* Billionaires shouldn't be given the power to steamroll society.\n* Electric cars alone won't save us.\n\n(While I encourage you to check out Craighton's visuals linked to on his website, I've transcribed the text for the benefit of disabled users and anyone else who doesn't want to click away.)\n\n;\n\n[https://craightonberman.com/Notes-on-the-Cyb-rtr-ck](https://craightonberman.com/Notes-on-the-Cyb-rtr-ck)\n\nDesign is more than an aesthetic preference\u0014It's a reflection of cultural values. And the Cybertruck is the most cynical design of the 21^(st) century. The Cybertruck's design offers no subtlety, no nuance, no layers\u0014just  blunt directness. It \"tells it like it is\"\u0014a cynical reflection of modern America.\n\nThe things we make reflect the times:\n\n* Self Care\n* Health &amp; Wealth\n* Techno Optimism\n* Manifest Destiny\n\n# Aggression as a Virtue\n\nThe Cybertruck reflects a uniquely american urge to be \"alpha\" at all times. Individuality has rained us to stand out\u0014and blustering aggression does just that.\n\n# Self-Centered Protectionism\n\n\"Self Defense\" is elevated above notions of \"Public Safety\". The Cybertruck contrasts Interior \"safety\" with blatant exterior danger.\n\n# Paramilitary Cosplay\n\nMilitary and tactical aesthetics have become normalized in the mainstream fashion world. The Cybertruck offers a sanitized military style, sans the less marketable concept of industrialized murder.\n\n# Dystopian Fantasy\n\nFor those that will buy the Cybertruck, dystopian aesthetics have and \"edgy\" cool factor. Around the world actual dystopic scenarios are unfolding in real time. The privileged believe they are insulated from this instability. \n\nUltimately the Cybertruck is a vanity project by a billionaire\u0014which in and of itself has become a cultural value: we like to celebrate the wealthy as heroes (or hate them ans anti-heroes) instead of pushing for a massive global wealth redistribution.\n\n# One Final Thought\n\nIn the current climate catastrophe, even an electrified auto industry would require massive resource extraction, a carbon-free grid, and would still further the paradigm of personal vehicles and the sprawling urban design that supports them. So even a \"friendly auto aesthetic is problematic. (But it ain't Cybertruck problematic.)",

I decided to run some numbers to try to decide the best approach for repairing a car vs trading in for a used car.\n\nThis prompted some math.\n\nI\u0019m looking out five years. To keep the scion, I would spend roughly $20K in five years to drive and maintain a car I already own. This includes gas costs, insurance, and repairs I\u0019m expecting to do. All to keep driving a 2008 vehicle.\n\nCompare this buying a used 2022 Ford Escape, which runs around $22K. Factoring in interest, gas, insurance, and assuming no major maintenance, it works out to be roughly $40K over five years to drive this car.\n\nI will be buying an electric car. I have free charging at my job (which may go away one day), and with the $4K federal tax rebate, I can get a used BMW i3. It\u0019d cost me about $17K over five years.

The assembly will consist of a main bumper body, an actuator, a screw winch, a trolley, and all the mounting equipment. If the vehicle detects that a collision is imminent, an electric motor will drive the screw winch, lowering a portion of the bumper. This lower bumper will be positioned in front of and overlap with the stationary part of the bumper. Once this lower portion is in place, it will hit a pedestrian below the knees, flinging them upward for a safer outcome.\n\nI realize this is targeted at the niche market of off-roaders right now, but I'm not sure I like the precedent this could set. In my eyes, this would excuse automakers for producing vehicles that are dangerous to those outside cars and allow them to pass the responsibility of maintaining these systems to the owners of their vehicles instead. I'd be afraid of this becoming normal for the ever-growing trucks and SUVs on our roads in the long run if this passes tests and counts for pedestrian safety.\n\nThis winch assembly might be a fine solution while it is in operating order. That is, until the sensor and/or motor fail over time, the assembly gets destroyed by whatever off-roading these owners will actually do, or the vehicle owners remove it to replace the bumper with something aftermarket. I doubt many will bother to maintain/fix these systems. Also, we all know how great Tesla's self-driving system is at correctly detecting pedestrians and cyclists. I don't have much faith that whatever Ford is implementing is more accurate.\n\nCars should be designed to fundamentally meet all safety requirements, including those for pedestrians when that gets integrated into the NTHSA's tests, without using gimmicks which may or may not function for the vehicle's lifetime. What do we think, is this actually a better solution than I'm giving it credit for?",

      "text": "All bikers and pedestrians outside the cars have to breathe their toxic fumes but those inside the cars don't. My suggestion for a law is to have a feedback system where a proportional amount of exhaust gas is fed into the cabin, through a breathing apparatus. Exceptions are; disabled people, children and commercial traffic. This way, EVs and hybrid vehicles and more efficient ICEs are incentivized as that means less toxic fumes inhaled. And more importantly people might think twice before using their cars.\n\nFailure to wear the gasmask unless you have explicit clearance to do so, manipulating or otherwise tampering with the vehicular exhaust gas rerouting equipment results in immediate confiscation and nullification of the car and repeated offences bring the capital punishment by garrote.",

      "text": "I don't think this idea is good and has probably been discussed in the past, but I'm going to post my idea here anyway so I can get it out of my head and stop dwelling on it. And please interpret everything I say as satire.\n\nStory:\n\nSo, I was thinking about Adam Something's satirical [post](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcvfHa-GHSOHFAjU0-Ie57A/community?lc=UgzQm63rsj8XdE_6OPB4AaABAg&amp;lb=UgkxBICqJHnCay_d_GXavSaJc-9WAi4nazgo) about seeing a rail inspection vehicle (a car with train wheels on a train track).\n\nThen I thought to myself \"We have a car on train tracks, what if we put a train on the road?\"\n\nAnd then I remembered that [LeTourneau's Land Trains](https://youtu.be/abGyX2uwXsw) existed. However, they were originally a niche cargo transportation vehicle that failed for various reasons. Then I thought \"what if you took LeTourneau's Land Train concept, but you design it for passenger services?\"\n\nTake LeTourneau's modular fuel electric drive system and scale it down to use in bus wheels. Now you have an electric bus that can run on either fuel or batteries. Now make a bunch of modular bus passenger wagons and link them all into a train. It's a Bus Train!\n\nI live in the United States where car-brain politicians seem to believe that it's a cardinal sin to spend money on anything other than maintaining and expanding roads and highways.\n\nImagine yourself as a US politician. Your cities need some kind of public transportation to help reduce traffic. Trains and trams would be a perfect solution, but it's a sin to build them. Now here comes in a salesman with this new \"Bus Train\". It's a train that goes on roads! Why spend money on train and tram infrastructure when you can buy a Bus Train as your \"public transportation\" and you can keep building roads because that's the only thing your car-brain religion knows how to build. Solve traffic by having people ride on an obscenely long bendy bus that snakes through your city.\n\nMy brain keeps pondering this idea.\n\nI know it's a dumb idea, but the US has funded MANY dumb public transport ideas in the past.\n\nWhat I want to know is, would US politicians be smart enough to realize that the \"Bus Train\" is a dumb idea and shouldn't be pursued, OR would US politicians think it's a brilliant idea and throw millions of dollars at me to develop this idea?\n\nWhat if someone did fund this dumb idea? How cursed would it be to see an obscenely long bendy bus snaking its way through a city?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k85m1soap4ka1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f9d3dfa83dc8db67022c6026afa2c2f252acd7d",

Trains and buses today look super utilitarian and the seats leave a lot to be desired. I think if the experience was enjoyable you would get a lot more riders. People like using monorails, because the experience is generally pretty fun. The Seattle monorail in particular manages to pay for itself. \n\nOne thing about older transit vehicles is the paint schemes were quite beautiful. The Pacific Electric Red cars were works of art.

      "text": "It seems to me that mass transit for people should also as a concept apply to transport of goods.\n\nWe don't have an organised system of goods delivery. Look at any street for a while and you will probably see one of the many private companies, be it Amazon, or a local supermarket, or the separate parcel delivery companies in their vans. The duplication and added trip length must be very considerable.\n\nWorking vehicles like these, whilst they have good justification to be quite large, as compared to SUV's and most cars carrying one occupant, are still another kind of vehicle that could be made more efficient and therefore reduced in number and trips.\n\nBack in the day, in my country, we were at times strangely ahead of the curve, and didn't seem to realise it, or capitalise on it fully -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m4VWrfPNxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m4VWrfPNxM)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk\\_float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_float)\n\nOne problem that was encountered by these vehicle manufacturers was that they lasted so long that some eventually went out of business. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/they-don-t-make-milk-floats-the-way-they-used-to-1587039.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/they-don-t-make-milk-floats-the-way-they-used-to-1587039.html)\n\nWhat may have been the largest fleet of electric vehicles in the world was served in a hub and spoke pattern from regional distribution yards owned by local dairies, now of course all sold off.\n\n&gt;In August 1967, the UK Electric Vehicle Association put out a [press release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release) stating that Britain had more battery-electric vehicles on its roads than the rest of the world combined.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_float#cite_note-Autocar1967-3) It is not clear what research the association had undertaken into the quantity of electric vehicles of other countries, but closer inspection disclosed that almost all of the battery-driven vehicles licensed for UK road use were milk floats.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_float#cite_note-Autocar1967-3)\n\nA resurrection of a system like that could combine a lot of different deliveries in one go to each street, served more than once a day.\n\nPerhaps companies can bid to serve areas and purchase local distribution centres, rather than duplicating their delivery routes and warehouses? Delivery rights could finance other public services. They could also collect from separate supermarkets in one go, or share a distribution centre there, or supermarkets would be required to cooperate somehow (I'm not sure how that could work though).\n\nSomething along these lines but narrower too and possibly articulated maybe able to share bike lanes as they tend to be pretty slow, similar to cargo bikes, but for longer range and larger payloads.\n\nAll this though would require a big change in mindset, similar to that required to modal switch to public transport, but on the side this time its the corporate world that is the focus. And would probably have to be forced to happen with a financial advantage being seen by the businesses that cooperate to use it and legislation to push cooperation through local carriers.\n\nFreight pipelines\n\nThis is somewhat different but similar in concept to an urban metro, this is more like the intercity train of the system and could distribute to the local distribution yards mentioned above. Yes freight rail does this but tends to only serve very large regional hubs.\n\n[https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/underground-pipelines-concept-to-cut-freight-traffic](https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/underground-pipelines-concept-to-cut-freight-traffic)\n\n[http://www.cargocap.com/content/what-is-cargocap](http://www.cargocap.com/content/what-is-cargocap)\n\nOf course, you could also move a lot more freight by rail than we do, and that is something that should be done either way.",

      "text": "First of all, I really like the concept behind this subreddit. It\u0019s inspired me to commute on my motorcycle much more often. It\u0019s a 250cc bike that gets about 65mpg.\n\nI\u0019m 10-15 min away from work depending on traffic in a not-so-bicycle friendly area, so responsible motorcycling is the next best thing for my situation IMO.\n\nIt\u0019s freeing. It takes up less space, costs less to maintain, and it feels good to not support big oil as much while leaving less of a carbon footprint. \n\nHowever, I don\u0019t think I\u0019ve seen this issue get addressed yet.\n\nSo here we go& I hit a deer while going about 15-20mph on my motorcycle last Friday night. \n\nI was lucky. It was a 40mph zone and I managed to slow down quite a bit first because I had already dodged one deer. I was still in the process of slowing down from that one when the other deer jumped out in front and& BOOM!!! Nothing I could have done.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was tumbling and ended up in a penguin slide across the pavement.\n\nFortunately, I\u0019m okay due to having about $2,000 worth of safety gear on. Just lots of bruising, soreness, and a sprained knee. I got VERY lucky.\n\nI work at a motorcycle shop and get heavy discounts, so I'm also lucky in the sense that I could afford such good gear.\n\nBut let's be real here& E Bikes can easily go 15-20mph+ too and barely anyone wears anything other than a helmet on them.\n\nPedal assist bicycles would be very uncomfortable to use while wearing heavy safety gear anyway.\n\nAnd it doesn\u0019t just have to be a deer that can mess you up& it could be leaves that makes you slide out, a smaller animal, or a variety of other things.\n\nI\u0019m 29 and my body can still bounce back decently well. I\u0019ll hopefully be back on the bike in a few weeks.\n\nBut how do we expect people to just hop on e bicycles as a solution to replace cars without addressing the fact that many people feel too vulnerable on them?\n\nI wouldn\u0019t expect a 50+ y/o to function at all after taking a beating like I just did. It fuckin hurt! =\u0002 \n\nI understand that over-development is likely one of the reasons deer are everywhere in the first place since they have nowhere to go.\n\nI also understand that without cars, I\u0019d feel safer going through town on a bicycle.\n\nAnd I also understand that cars are deadly to pedestrians and that overall, e bikes would kill far less people.\n\nBut with all that being said, I still think you\u0019re at greater risk of *personal* injury. Maybe not on a standard bicycle, but definitely on an e bike or moped& or even electric scooter.\n\nAs someone who\u0019s had a history of 2 hip surgeries, a broken back, and a variety of soft tissue damage from an active lifestyle, I don\u0019t expect anyone else to expose themselves to similar risks. It\u0019s not for everyone.\n\nSo how can we\u0014in a world of cars\u0014make alternative transport like e bikes safer?\n\nAnd in areas with fewer cars, how can we manage other hazards like animals?\n\nPublic transport can solve most of this but we still need smaller vehicles to make up for that last bit of distance.\n\nTL;DR I\u0019m concerned about the higher personal risk of alternative transportation. Personally, I wouldn\u0019t want my own mother riding an e bicycle through town or where there could be animals that jump out in front of her.",

      "text": "Context:\n\nRomania, in the EU, is seemingly competing with the UK over high energy prices. There's a consumer subsidy in place for energy based on a certain limit. For electricity, it's 255 kWh per month. If you stay under that energy use amount, your electricity bill gets subsidized to a much lower price.  If you pass that ceiling, you pay the full price, which is pretty high. Electric car owners have a problem:  the fuel is expensive. If they charge at home, they risk using more than 255  and paying the real price.  Their solution: look for free or cheap charging stations and charge there. Many of these stations have closed, since the costs are so large that it's bad business.  The few that are left attract large queues and, with that, competition and people trying to jump queue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAuto translation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It's 1:30 a.m., past midnight. Sunday  to Monday night, instead of resting for a new week of work, a group of  people wait, scruffy, in the parking lot of Kaufland P\u0003curari. With  their eyes on the illuminated phones, they take another look at a tall  device, with a colored screen, with three thick cables connected to one  machine each. These are the residents of Ia\u0019i who had the courage to enter \"a new automotive era\": that of electric cars.** \n\nThey  ended up not being able to charge their cars at home anymore, due to  the imposed energy ceiling of 255 kilowatts per month. Disappointed  at present, they were attracted a few years ago by the reduced price of  energy, and now, they are looking to charge their cars with electricity  for free, until this facility also disappears. In  fact, Kaufland is the last \"combatant on the ramparts\" of the fight  against climate pollution: the store in P\u0003curari is the last one that  still offers free electricity to the owners of green cars in Iasi, but  the offer will, in all probability, be discontinued in the near future. This  is why, day and night, residents who have purchased electric cars  charge their cars here for free, even if the store's hours are only  until 10 p.m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dacia car charging in queue](https://preview.redd.it/xi2trddc7eq91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ca86d238dfe43e71042d3b6eee49d95e1d35fd2)\n\n\"I stay at home, I bought a BMW hybrid. It's hard to charge with current, I already have two hours of battery life, for six kilowatts. I am 64 years old, and I live in Valea Lupului. I'd rather stay at Kaufland to charge my car battery for free than at home. Every day, charging at the car ends up exceeding the limit of 255 kilowatts, if I charge it at home. That's it,\" a man tells us, circling by his black car. It is connected to a cable that provides little energy, similar to at home. The other two, which quickly charge the battery, are occupied by a Tesla and a Renault Zoe. At 4 o'clock in the morning, there were still people from Ia\u0019i loading their cars. On the application, there were three that had the cables connected, and three more were waiting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kaufland parking charging station](https://preview.redd.it/gt62mcdy8eq91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5215087828fcccc434c986e868b75ceb29782ee1)\n\n## At Lidl, the drivers got into a fight in front of the loaders\n\nKaufland stores were among the big companies that promoted electric, green cars. So did the state, but the latter has meanwhile abandoned the strategy of offering free electricity. However, Kaufland had come quite far: it had created a network of fast car chargers on the route Bucharest - Iasi - Chisinau. You only had to make monthly purchases of at least 500 lei with them. But,  with the war in Ukraine and the explosion of the price of electricity,  those from Kufland gradually abandoned this policy, which they still  maintain only in a few locations. Another store chain that wanted to attract customers with electric cars is Lidl. The company opened its large store in Moara de Foc, and a space with electric car chargers was created for customers. After the crisis of the increase in fuel and the increase in the price of electricity,\n\n\"I went several times to separate them. They simply didn't want to follow the line on the application. They fought like crazy. So they closed\", an employee here told us. This  is how it happens that in the place of electric charging there is a  large notice, to be noticed from the street, which warns that the device  is defective. Another  place where you could charge for free for a while, until current prices  increased, was at the Tudor Office Center building on Ciurchi, between  Metalurgie and T\u0003t\u0003ra_i. And here it was closed, no longer profitable. \"It's defective, charging doesn't work anymore. The owners said they would fix it, but they never did,\" said a security guard here.\n\n## What are the charging prices currently\n\nCurrently,  the main problem of those who have purchased electric or hybrid cars is  to find a place to charge their cars at the most convenient price. The specific applications do not contain all the places to load, so it is good to talk to older owners. One of them gave us a tip. \"It  is a company in the industrial area that has a place to charge and  sells Fast current, i.e. supercharge, at a price of 1.2 lei per  kilowatt. But don't tell many\", he drew our attention. In  comparison, at the E.ON Drive stations in the city as well as in the  county or region, the company sells one kilowatt of electricity at Fast,  i.e. quickly charged - approximately one hour and ten minutes, at the  price of 2.29 lei. If you have a car that \"swallows\" 40 kilowatts, you have to pay 90 lei out of your pocket for a quick charge.\n\nThe price for a charge at E.ON Drive is 1.79 kilowatts, which means that you will pay 71 lei. However, the most advantageous seem to be those who live at home and have solar panels. The price for an equipment with solar panels that gives 9.9 kilowatts on a sunny day is 10,000 euros, including VAT. The  warranty for these solar panels is 25 years, during which time the  investment is amortized, and the owner benefits from cheap current  including for an electric car. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAuto translate: [https://www-ziaruldeiasi-ro.translate.goog/stiri/bataie-pe-curent-gratis-pentru-incarcarea-masinilor-electrice-cozi-la-miezul-noptii-in-cateva-puncte-strategice--334267.html?\\_x\\_tr\\_sl=auto&amp;\\_x\\_tr\\_tl=en&amp;\\_x\\_tr\\_hl=en&amp;\\_x\\_tr\\_pto=wapp](https://www-ziaruldeiasi-ro.translate.goog/stiri/bataie-pe-curent-gratis-pentru-incarcarea-masinilor-electrice-cozi-la-miezul-noptii-in-cateva-puncte-strategice--334267.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp)",

It is an absolute shit show, honestly.\n\nThis is less related to the cold, but the upkeep of car infrastructure is also terrible. The constant salting of the roads affects the soil and plant growth in later seasons. Accidents happen left and right. The winter roads would be a lot safer with less vehicles on the street and I genuinely believe we\u0019d be happier as a society if we just had more subways and LRT to get around on when it got this cold. The trains in my city never fail me when extreme weather hits.\n\nAny other input?

      "title": "Have you read/your thoughts on Andrés Gorz's criticism of car culture?",
      "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndré Gorz\n\nThe social ideology of the motorcar\n\n1973\n\nThe worst thing about cars is that they are like castles or villas by the sea: luxury goods invented for the exclusive pleasure of a very rich minority, and which in conception and nature were never intended for the people. Unlike the vacuum cleaner, the radio, or the bicycle, which retain their use value when everyone has one, the car, like a villa by the sea, is only desirable and useful insofar as the masses don\u0019t have one. That is how in both conception and original purpose the car is a luxury good. And the essence of luxury is that it cannot be democratized. If everyone can have luxury, no one gets any advantages from it. On the contrary, everyone diddles, cheats, and frustrates everyone else, and is diddled, cheated, and frustrated in return.\n\nThis is pretty much common knowledge in the case of the seaside villas. No politico has yet dared to claim that to democratize the right to vacation would mean a villa with private beach for every family. Everyone understands that if each of 13 or 14 million families were to use only 10 meters of the coast, it would take 140,000km of beach in order for all of them to have their share! To give everyone his or her share would be to cut up the beaches in such little strips\u0014or to squeeze the villas so tightly together\u0014that their use value would be nil and their advantage over a hotel complex would disappear. In short, democratization of access to the beaches point to only one solution\u0014the collectivist one. And this solution is necessarily at war with the luxury of the private beach, which is a privilege that a small minority takes as their right at the expense of all.\n\nNow, why is it that what is perfectly obvious in the case of the beaches is not generally acknowledged to be the case for transportation? Like the beach house, doesn\u0019t a car occupy scarce space? Doesn\u0019t it deprive the others who use the roads (pedestrians, cyclists, streetcar and bus drivers)? Doesn\u0019t it lose its use value when everyone uses his or her own? And yet there are plenty of politicians who insist that every family has the right to at least one car and that it\u0019s up to the \u001cgovernment\u001d to make it possible for everyone to park conveniently, drive easily in the city, and go on holiday at the same time as everyone else, going 70 mph on the roads to vacation spots. The monstrousness of this demagogic nonsense is immediately apparent, and yet even the left doesn\u0019t disdain resorting to it. Why is the car treated like a sacred cow? Why, unlike other \u001cprivative\u001d goods, isn\u0019t it recognized as an antisocial luxury? The answer should be sought in the following two aspects of driving:\n\nLet us look more closely now at these two points.\n\n1. Mass motoring effects an absolute triumph of bourgeois ideology on the level of daily life. It gives and supports in everyone the illusion that each individual can seek his or her own benefit at the expense of everyone else. Take the cruel and aggressive selfishness of the driver who at any moment is figuratively killing the \u001cothers,\u001d who appear merely as physical obstacles to his or her own speed. This aggressive and competitive selfishness marks the arrival of universally bourgeois behavior, and has come into being since driving has become commonplace. (\u001cYou\u0019ll never have socialism with that kind of people,\u001d an East German friend told me, upset by the spectacle of Paris traffic).\n\n2. The automobile is the paradoxical example of a luxury object that has been devalued by its own spread. But this practical devaluation has not yet been followed by an ideological devaluation. The myth of the pleasure and benefit of the car persists, though if mass transportation were widespread its superiority would be striking. The persistence of this myth is easily explained. The spread of the private car has displaced mass transportation and altered city planning and housing in such a way that it transfers to the car functions which its own spread has made necessary. An ideological (\u001ccultural\u001d) revolution would be needed to break this circle. Obviously this is not to be expected from the ruling class (either right or left).\n\nWhen the car was invented, it was to provide a few of the very rich with a completely unprecedented privilege: that of traveling much faster than everyone else. No one up to then had ever dreamt of it. The speed of all coaches was essentially the same, whether you were rich or poor. The carriages of the rich didn\u0019t go any faster than the carts of the peasants, and trains carried everyone at the same speed (they didn\u0019t begin to have different speeds until they began to compete with the automobile and the airplane). Thus, until the turn of the century, the elite did not travel at a different speed from the people. The motorcar was going to change all that. For the first time class differences were to be extended to speed and to the means of transportation.\n\nThis means of transportation at first seemed unattainable to the masses\u0014it was so different from ordinary means. There was no comparison between the motorcar and the others: the cart, the train, the bicycle, or the horse-car. Exceptional beings went out in self-propelled vehicles that weighed at least a ton and whose extremely complicated mechanical organs were as mysterious as they were hidden from view. For one important aspect of the automobile myth is that for the first time people were riding in private vehicles whose operating mechanisms were completely unknown to them and whose maintenance and feeding they had to entrust to specialists. Here is the paradox of the automobile: it appears to confer on its owners limitless freedom, allowing them to travel when and where they choose at a speed equal to or greater than that of the train. But actually, this seeming independence has for its underside a radical dependency. Unlike the horse rider, the wagon driver, or the cyclist, the motorist was going to depend for the fuel supply, as well as for the smallest kind of repair, on dealers and specialists in engines, lubrication, and ignition, and on the interchangeability of parts. Unlike all previous owners of a means of locomotion, the motorist\u0019s relationship to his or her vehicle was to be that of user and consumer-and not owner and master. This vehicle, in other words, would oblige the owner to consume and use a host of commercial services and industrial products that could only be provided by some third party. The apparent independence of the automobile owner was only concealing the actual radical dependency.\n\nThe oil magnates were the first to perceive the prize that could be extracted from the wide distribution of the motorcar. If people could be induced to travel in cars, they could be sold the fuel necessary to move them. For the first time in history, people would become dependent for their locomotion on a commercial source of energy. There would be as many customers for the oil industry as there were motorists\u0014and since there would be as many motorists as there were families, the entire population would become the oil merchants\u0019 customers. The dream of every capitalist was about to come true. Everyone was going to depend for their daily needs on a commodity that a single industry held as a monopoly.\n\nAll that was left was to get the population to drive cars. Little persuasion would be needed. It would be enough to get the price of a car down by using mass production and the assembly line. People would fall all over themselves to buy it. They fell over themselves all right, without noticing they were being led by the nose. What, in fact, did the automobile industry offer them? Just this: \u001cFrom now on, like the nobility and the bourgeoisie, you too will have the privilege of driving faster than everybody else. In a motorcar society the privilege of the elite is made available to you.\u001d\n\nPeople rushed to buy cars until, as the working class began to buy them as well, defrauded motorists realized they had been had. They had been promised a bourgeois privilege, they had gone into debt to acquire it, and now they saw that everyone else could also get one. What good is a privilege if everyone can have it? It\u0019s a fool\u0019s game. Worse, it pits everyone against everyone else. General paralysis is brought on by a general clash. For when everyone claims the right to drive at the privileged speed of the bourgeoisie, everything comes to a halt, and the speed of city traffic plummets\u0014in Boston as in Paris, Rome, or London\u0014to below that of the horsecar; at rush hours the average speed on the open road falls below the speed of a bicyclist.\n\nNothing helps. All the solutions have been tried. They all end up making things worse. No matter if they increase the number of city expressways, beltways, elevated crossways, 16-lane highways, and toll roads, the result is always the same. The more roads there are in service, the more cars clog them, and city traffic becomes more paralyzingly congested. As long as there are cities, the problem will remain unsolved. No matter how wide and fast a superhighway is, the speed at which vehicles can come off it to enter the city cannot be greater than the average speed on the city streets. As long as the average speed in Paris is 10 to 20 kmh, depending on the time of day, no one will be able to get off the beltways and autoroutes around and into the capital at more than 10 to 20 kmh.\n\nThe same is true for all cities. It is impossible to drive at more than an average of 20 kmh in the tangled network of streets, avenues, and boulevards that characterise the traditional cities. The introduction of faster vehicles inevitably disrupts city traffic, causing bottlenecks-and finally complete paralysis.\n\nIf the car is to prevail, there\u0019s still one solution: get rid of the cities. That is, string them out for hundreds of miles along enormous roads, making them into highway suburbs. That\u0019s what\u0019s been done in the United States. Ivan Illich sums up the effect in these startling figures: \u001cThe typical American devotes more than 1500 hours a year (which is 30 hours a week, or 4 hours a day, including Sundays) to his [or her] car. This includes the time spent behind the wheel, both in motion and stopped, the hours of work to pay for it and to pay for gas, tires, tolls, insurance, tickets, and taxes .Thus it takes this American 1500 hours to go 6000 miles (in the course of a year). Three and a half miles take him (or her) one hour. In countries that do not have a transportation industry, people travel at exactly this speed on foot, with the added advantage that they can go wherever they want and aren\u0019t restricted to asphalt roads.\u001d\n\nIt is true, Illich points out, that in non-industrialized countries travel uses only 3 to 8% of people\u0019s free time (which comes to about two to six hours a week). Thus a person on foot covers as many miles in an hour devoted to travel as a person in a car, but devotes 5 to 10 times less time in travel. Moral: The more widespread fast vehicles are within a society, the more time\u0014beyond a certain point\u0014people will spend and lose on travel. It\u0019s a mathematical fact.\n\nThe reason? We\u0019ve just seen it: The cities and towns have been broken up into endless highway suburbs, for that was the only way to avoid traffic congestion in residential centers. But the underside of this solution is obvious: ultimately people can\u0019t get around conveniently because they are far away from everything. To make room for the cars, distances have increased. People live far from their work, far from school, far from the supermarket\u0014which then requires a second car so the shopping can be done and the children driven to school. Outings? Out of the question. Friends? There are the neighbors& and that\u0019s it. In the final analysis, the car wastes more time than it saves and creates more distance than it overcomes. Of course, you can get yourself to work doing 60 mph, but that\u0019s because you live 30 miles from your job and are willing to give half an hour to the last 6 miles. To sum it all up: \u001cA good part of each day\u0019s work goes to pay for the travel necessary to get to work.\u001d (Ivan Illich).\n\nMaybe you are saying, \u001cBut at least in this way you can escape the hell of the city once the workday is over.\u001d There we are, now we know: \u001cthe city,\u001d the great city which for generations was considered a marvel, the only place worth living, is now considered to be a \u001chell.\u001d Everyone wants to escape from it, to live in the country. Why this reversal? For only one reason. The car has made the big city uninhabitable. It has made it stinking, noisy, suffocating, dusty, so congested that nobody wants to go out in the evening anymore. Thus, since cars have killed the city, we need faster cars to escape on superhighways to suburbs that are even farther away. What an impeccable circular argument: give us more cars so that we can escape the destruction caused by cars.\n\nFrom being a luxury item and a sign of privilege, the car has thus become a vital necessity. You have to have one so as to escape from the urban hell of the cars. Capitalist industry has thus won the game: the superfluous has become necessary. There\u0019s no longer any need to persuade people that they want a car; its necessity is a fact of life. It is true that one may have one\u0019s doubts when watching the motorized escape along the exodus roads. Between 8 and 9:30 a.m., between 5:30 and 7 p.m., and on weekends for five and six hours the escape routes stretch out into bumper-to-bumper processions going (at best) the speed of a bicyclist and in a dense cloud of gasoline fumes. What remains of the car\u0019s advantages? What is left when, inevitably, the top speed on the roads is limited to exactly the speed of the slowest car?\n\nFair enough. After killing the city, the car is killing the car. Having promised everyone they would be able to go faster, the automobile industry ends up with the unrelentingly predictable result that everyone has to go as slowly as the very slowest, at a speed determined by the simple laws of fluid dynamics. Worse: having been invented to allow its owner to go where he or she wishes, at the time and speed he or she wishes, the car becomes, of all vehicles, the most slavish, risky, undependable and uncomfortable. Even if you leave yourself an extravagant amount of time, you never know when the bottlenecks will let you get there. You are bound to the road as inexorably as the train to its rails. No more than the railway traveller can you stop on impulse, and like the train you must go at a speed decided by someone else. Summing up, the car has none of the advantages of the train and all of its disadvantages, plus some of its own: vibration, cramped space, the danger of accidents, the effort necessary to drive it.\n\nAnd yet, you may say, people don\u0019t take the train. Of course! How could they? Have you ever tried to go from Boston to New York by train? Or from Ivry to Treport? Or from Garches to Fountainebleau? Or Colombes to l\u0019Isle-Adam? Have you tried on a summer Saturday or Sunday? Well, then, try it and good luck to you! You\u0019ll observe that automobile capitalism has thought of everything. Just when the car is killing the car, it arranges for the alternatives to disappear, thus making the car compulsory. So first the capitalist state allowed the rail connections between the cities and the surrounding countryside to fall to pieces, and then it did away with them. The only ones that have been spared are the high-speed intercity connections that compete with the airlines for a bourgeois clientele. There\u0019s progress for you!\n\nThe truth is, no one really has any choice. You aren\u0019t free to have a car or not because the suburban world is designed to be a function of the car and, more and more, so is the city world. That is why the ideal revolutionary solution, which is to do away with the car in favour of the bicycle, the streetcar, the bus, and the driverless taxi, is not even applicable any longer in the big commuter cities like Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Trappes, or even Brussels, which are built by and for the automobile. These splintered cities are strung out along empty streets lined with identical developments; and their urban landscape (a desert) says, \u001cThese streets are made for driving as quickly as possible from work to home and vice versa. You go through here, you don\u0019t live here. At the end of the workday everyone ought to stay at home, and anyone found on the street after nightfall should be considered suspect of plotting evil.\u001d In some American cities the act of strolling in the streets at night is grounds for suspicion of a crime.\n\nSo, the jig is up? No, but the alternative to the car will have to be comprehensive. For in order for people to be able to give up their cars, it won\u0019t be enough to offer them more comfortable mass transportation. They will have to be able to do without transportation altogether because they\u0019ll feel at home in their neighborhoods, their community, their human-sized cities, and they will take pleasure in walking from work to home-on foot, or if need be by bicycle. No means of fast transportation and escape will ever compensate for the vexation of living in an uninhabitable city in which no one feels at home or the irritation of only going into the city to work or, on the other hand, to be alone and sleep.\n\n\u001cPeople,\u001d writes Illich, \u001cwill break the chains of overpowering transportation when they come once again to love as their own territory their own particular beat, and to dread getting too far away from it.\u001d But in order to love \u001cone\u0019s territory\u001d it must first of all be made livable, and not trafficable. The neighborhood or community must once again become a microcosm shaped by and for all human activities, where people can work, live, relax, learn, communicate, and knock about, and which they manage together as the place of their life in common. When someone asked him how people would spend their time after the revolution, when capitalist wastefulness had been done away with, Marcuse answered, \u001cWe will tear down the big cities and build new ones. That will keep us busy for a while.\u001d\n\nThese new cities might be federations of communities (or neighborhoods) surrounded by green belts whose citizens-and especially the schoolchildren-will spend several hours a week growing the fresh produce they need. To get around everyday they would be able to use all kinds of transportation adapted to a medium-sized town: municipal bicycles, trolleys or trolley-buses, electric taxis without drivers. For longer trips into the country, as well as for guests, a pool of communal automobiles would be available in neighborhood garages. The car would no longer be a necessity. Everything will have changed: the world, life, people. And this will not have come about all by itself.\n\nMeanwhile, what is to be done to get there? Above all, never make transportation an issue by itself. Always connect it to the problem of the city, of the social division of labour, and to the way this compartmentalizes the many dimensions of life. One place for work, another for \u001cliving,\u001d a third for shopping, a fourth for learning, a fifth for entertainment. The way our space is arranged carries on the disintegration of people that begins with the division of labour in the factory. It cuts a person into slices, it cuts our time, our life, into separate slices so that in each one you are a passive consumer at the mercy of the merchants, so that it never occurs to you that work, culture, communication, pleasure, satisfaction of needs, and personal life can and should be one and the same thing: a unified life, sustained by the social fabric of the community.",

      "title": "How I would try to convince my past, car-brained self.",
      "text": "In this obviously hypothetical scenario, I will be going back in time to when I just started college. There I will talk to my past, car-brained self about cities where walking, cycling and public transportation can be viable alternatives to putting everyone into electric cars.\n\nFor some context, I have always been someone who focused on climate change, that it's indeed happening and that the burning of fossil fuels is what's causing it. Another aspect to decarbonization that I've always had appreciation for is how it results in the elimination of other pollutants, particularly NOx, SOx, ash, PM, HC emissions and smog. I've always seen that as a side benefit that just hasn't been talked about enough. However, I grew up in car-dependency to the point I literally couldn't imagine anything else.\n\nThe first thing I would say is that electric cars are good. If there are going to be cars on the road at all, they better be electric. I would hold off on criticising electric cars for the time being as my past self used to see any critique of electric vehicles as a parroting of fossil fuel industry propaganda. Call it a red line set by my past self. To avoid crossing red lines, I would instead pitch the concept of Car-low cities as not just compatible but complementary to electric cars for addressing climate change, air pollution and oil-dependence in general. The reason this is helpful is because of reduced car demand. The fewer cars we demand, the less batteries we'll need to stop using ICE cars and the more batteries will become available for dedicating to storing renewable energy when it's really windy or sunny. Overall, this results in faster decarbonisation than if demand for cars stay high. \n\nThere, I consciously implied battery production to continue unabated regardless and how I avoided criticising batteries. Again, it's important that I avoid my past self's red lines. Even now, I'm convinced that most criticisms against batteries are made in bad faith as they only tend to be used for shutting down discussions of alternatives to ICE vehicles. On that note, I must also be careful to avoid giving the false impression that urban planning centered around walking, cycling and public transportation is this perfect solution that won't actually get any traction. I used to be very sceptical of cycling infrastructure and public transportation because I never saw them done right before. This is why it was important to emphasise human-centric urban planning as a complement or supplemental to electric cars rather than a competitive either-or type of dilemma. It means that even if my past self has low confidence in human-centric urban planning picking up steam, at least electric cars would still be around as an alternative to fall back on.\n\nThe message I would give to my younger, car-brained self would be to see human-centric urban planning as an add-on, rather than as a competitor, to electric cars for the goal of weaning off of oil.\n\nWhat's also important is that I remember how I ended up getting enthusiastic human-centric urban planning: because of the overwhelming benefits to health, safety, quality of life and the wallet. Even my past self would have greatly appreciated the health benefits of walking and cycling, reduced traffic fatalities, reduced traffic congestion and not being forced into paying out the nose on car payments and insurance.\n\nIn conclusion, the way I would try to convince my past, car-brained self to embrace human-centric urban planning is to: \n\n1a) avoid stepping on the red lines by steering clear of attacking electric cars and batteries,\n\n1b) by pitching human-centric urban planning as supplemental to electric cars,\n\n2) by making the case for human-centric urban planning as good for health, safety, quality of life and the budget.\n\nHopefully this gives some insight into how one might convince others of adopting human-centric urban planning, if not getting them enthusiastic about it.\n\nSo how did you get convinced about human-centric urban planning and how might you have tried to convince your past self about it earlier?",

I don't think cars need to get into every little crevasse and I think large car-free zones are both useful and reasonable.\n\nI also dislike the widespread use of large capacity cars for small capacity purposes, and I dislike the laws standing in the way of a middle ground between motorcycle and typical car. Long range high speed electric scooters have shown that even motorcycles are extremely overweight compared to what you need to transport a person long distances, and standardized battery-swapping stations would solve range issues forever. A 1-2 ton 5-seater is extremely overkill, and I think that now, with most families having one vehicle per adult, it makes sense for most to be buying slimmer, smaller, cheaper, lighter, more aerodynamic 2-seaters, with large families remaining as users of large family cars. I'm also personally more interested in tandem seating than side-by-side, as I dislike the standard of steering while sitting offset from center.\n\nEither way, in essence I'm asking this: How extreme is this sub?\n\nHow intent are you on forcibly stuffing me in a tight box with all of you?\n\nBecause in my eyes, the only good train is no more than half full, or I'd rather drive my last mile transportation all the miles.",

      "text": "I would preface this by saying that I don't think Los Angeles is perfect or that there is no sprawl in LA. Many sprawl advocates will use these facts to advocate greater sprawl in California. I think sprawl has been detrimental to the quality of life of southern California. But this is to say that the reputation Los Angeles has being super sprawled or car centric is not accurate. Things like strip malls, Cul de sacs, suburban office parks etc do exist in the LA area, but they are merely part of it and my view doesn't define it.\n\nDensity\n\nAccording to the US census, the average \"urban\" area has a density of 2,500 people per SQ mile. \n\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/ua-facts.html#:~:text=Urbanized%20Areas,-486%3A%20Number%20of&amp;text=2%2C534.4%20persons%20per%20square%20mile%3A%20Overall%20urbanized,population%20density%20in%20the%20U.S.\n\nThe average suburb has a density of 2,000 people per SQ mile.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-12/why-we-need-a-standard-definition-of-the-suburbs#:~:text=Suburbs%20are%20less%20dense%20than,2%2C000%20people%20per%20square%20mile.\n\nAccording to the Census the Urbanized Area of Los Angeles is the densest in the US at 7,000 people per SQ mile\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/ua-facts.html\n\nThe City of Los Angeles proper has a population density of 8,300 people per SQ mile. Not very high, but it is much denser than most American suburbs and most \"urban\" areas.\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/losangelescitycalifornia/POP010220\n\nBy comparison Boston and Chicago have population densities of roughly 12,000 - 13,000 people per SQ mile.\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/chicagocityillinois,bostoncitymassachusetts,losangelescitycalifornia/POP010220\n\nLos Angeles however has a lot of variation in how density is distributed. Koreatown and Central LA are quite dense. Koreatown exceeds some Boroughs in New York.\n\nhttp://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/parts-of-los-angeles-have-higher-population-densities-than-new-york-over-200000-people-live-in-informal-housing-pushing-population-densities-to-levels-that-surpass-queens-the-bronx-and-brooklyn/\n\nLA is weird you will often find historic and new mixed use developments right next to strip malls and single story single use buildings. \n\nPlus places like Santa Monica and Long Beach have even higher densities.\n\nWalkability could be a lot better for sure though.\n\nTransit\n\nLA Metro at it's height carried some 497 million riders\n\nhttps://la.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/la-me-g-ridership-slump-20160126-1.png\n\nSo it's actually comparable in numeric ridership to the Chicago CTA\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1294093/chicago-cta-network-total-annual-ridership/\n\nThough both are now carrying some 200 - 300 million people now.\n\nIt's also had a strong post pandemic recovery carrying 70 percent of pre pandemic ridership.\n\nhttps://thesource.metro.net/2021/12/29/2021-year-in-review/\n\nTransit ridership is even higher in central LA\n\nhttps://la.streetsblog.org/2015/03/03/l-a-vs-s-f-how-does-transportation-really-compare/\n\nLos Angeles has a somewhat higher percentage of car free households than the National average.\n\nhttps://www.governing.com/archive/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html\n\nhttps://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/10/22/u-s-cities-have-more-car-free-households-than-you-think/#:~:text=Nationally%2C%20only%208.7%20percent%20of,if%20not%20two%20or%20more.\n\nIn terms of per Capita vehicle miles Los Angeles City has lower VMT per Capita than other SOCAL cities.\n\nhttps://la.streetsblog.org/2019/08/20/fun-facts-on-how-much-people-drive-in-different-parts-of-southern-california-and-l-a/\n\nLos Angeles Metro area and the Bay Area have roughly equivalent vehicle miles per Capita\n\nhttps://www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/daily-miles-traveled\n\nI would also point out that LA voted in favor of more spending on Transit and each time with higher percentages.\n\nThe expo line attracted new riders and didn't merely redistribute old bus riders to rail\n\nhttps://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/press-release/12257690/los-angeles-county-metropolitan-transportation-authority-metro-seventy-percent-of-passengers-on-the-metro-expo-line-are-new-riders\n\nFreeways\n\nLos Angeles is also on the lower end when it comes to freeway miles per Capita. I think that number should be lower and I think a lot of places should remove, bury or reroute their freeways. Freeways don't belong in city centers.\n\nhttps://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2019/hm72.cfm\n\nhttp://www.publicpurpose.com/hwy-tti99ratio.htm\n\nMyth: Los Angeles was built around cars\n\nThis is absolutely not true. Los Angeles became what it is thanks to the Southern Pacific Railroad enabling westward migration and Pacific Electric railways enabling suburbanization. Los Angeles is spread out not because of cars, but because railways enabled people to travel farther distances. Los Angeles is more Akin to Tokyo or Mexico City in being both dense and spread out. Even the freeways follow former red car routes. Los Angeles wasn't built around cars, rather cars took it over and reduced the quality of life for all people involved.\n\nRemnants of Pacific Electric\n\nhttp://militantangeleno.blogspot.com/2015/11/pacific-electric-week-militants-pacific.html?m=1\n\nhttps://www.up.com/cs/groups/public/@uprr/@customers/documents/digitalmedia/img_up_prem_scal_inter_map.png\n\nhttps://railfan.com/ghosts-of-the-pacific-electric/",

Just looking on google maps for each of the areas I can afford to live in is disheartening. Sprawling parking lots absolutely everywhere. The city planning is wholly devoted to car transit. There is no such thing as 'not having a car' if you intend to actually go anywhere more than a few blocks. Luckily I will have a car, even though my preference would be to not have to rely on one. (Makes me feel extra shitty seeing as my parents are the ones assisting me with it). And I'm the *lucky* one. I'll be doing a reverse commute, spending less time than the majority of other Bay Area folks in transit.\n\nIf I could choose anywhere to live, I imagine a place replete with history, the old mixed with the new, amenities not too scarce, and transit (acceptably) reliable and (acceptably) affordable. It's how one interacts with their place of living. CA is the antithesis to this, lol. But I don't have any other options at this point. BART may or may not exist where I am able to find housing. And even still, you'd need a car to drive to the station and park. Then, the issue that it doesn't actually go to the city I need it to. And it's expensive. On the other hand, I'm not sure I'll even have access to a parking space for the car I'm going to need. All the prospective apartments are telling me that there's a long parking space waiting list already. Like honestly what do I even do in that case? \n\nThere is apparently good scenery and outdoors activities in those areas, though, and I'll get to visit soon to assess. But the inevitable reliance on driving is weighing on me. At times I feel such guilt running an engine just to transport myself, as if I as a person am worth frivolously churning through resources at such an alarming rate? I found a car with good mileage, but hybrids are out of my range and full electric will not work in my case.

I bring up how bad cars are for cities and people often with friends and family however they all reject the idea of cycling infrastructure and public transit as crazy because to them, cars can do anything.\n\nWhen discussing the possibility of bike infrastructure or decreasing the use of cars in every corner of transportation the people I'm talking to always bring up the first thing they can think of such as \"how would people park their cars in driveways if their was a segregated bike lane in the way\" or \"how would the city be able to fund bike lanes if it's still struggling to build basic roads after the 2011 Earthquake\".\n\nWhat are some small things the city can do to start decreasing the usage of cars and support transit infrastructure and bicycle usage without a complete redesign of the city, as looking at the Netherlands as an example would be unhelpful as the entirety of the city safe from city center is suburban.\n\n(TLDR; my suburban city is car dependent and I am looking for small changes the council could make that would have an extreme impact on the city from an urbanist perspective)",

      "title": "Welcome to /r/Fuckcars",
      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

Vance wants tax rebates for gas cars instead of EVs](https://qz.com/jd-vance-trump-gas-car-rebates-evs-1851594703)\n\n&gt;*As recently as 2020 Vance was seen praising solar energy and begged for a \u001cclean energy future\u001d to cure the \u001cclimate problem in our society.\u001d When it became clear to him that he\u0019d need Donald Trump\u0019s endorsement to win the Ohio senate race, he began a dramatic shift his positions on climate denialism and fossil fuels. This bill proved to Trump that Vance would kiss the ring in exchange for power, killing the old Vance to grow a new one in his image.*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*The Drive American Act seeks to gut the Biden administration\u0019s electric vehicle tax rebate program, with the first half of the bill undoing the program altogether. In the latter half of the bill, Vance proposes that American taxpayers follow him into a ridiculously circular logic that would instead place up to a $7,500 rebate on all new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, trucks, and SUVs. Vehicles with larger payloads and more seats would be eligible for more of the incentive. In order to take advantage of this, you\u0019d need to live in a household making less than $300,000, and the vehicle could not exceed $80,00o. Both \u001climits\u001d are well north of average.* ",

      "text": "Not sure if this has been posted yet.. couldn't find it anyways - but we got featured in Carbrain monthly! Be sure to check out the comments section for some great nuanced takes from the car persons. (/s)\n\n[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you imagine your life without a car or a truck? Do you see yourself biking to work or taking the bus every single day? Are you ready to carry groceries and supplies like in the old days? Well, this is what some people are dreaming of. We\u0019re not talking about 100, 1,000, or 10,000 people. No, there are over 217,000 supporters of the anti-car movement! It\u0019s worth understanding what they want, since these ideas tend to spread like wildfire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to a subreddit that has a very explicit name, people that are in favor of banning cars are not looking to make emergency vehicles disappear, they don\u0019t want to disrupt the supply chains dependent on trucks, and don\u0019t look at rural communities to make their plan happen. They also underline that the initiative isn\u0019t political and doesn\u0019t adhere to any set of \u001cleft\u001d or \u001cright\u001d values and beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What these guys and gals wish is to make everyone aware of the cost that we must all support because cars became so important for almost anything we do. This is clearer now that we\u0019ve all gradually returned to normal office hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-car community essentially agrees that building the roads and the needed utilities creates \u001can unwanted economic burden on communities\u001d that has proven to be costly everywhere, especially when you look at the yearly amount of dollars spent on maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they say this won\u0019t stop with the switch to all-electric and self-driving cars, since charging and moving around without human control will almost certainly guarantee the number of vehicles won\u0019t come down, and more money will be needed for charging and resting spots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Not enough room for everyone**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People also think cities give too much space to cars, parking, and gas or charging stations. They want more parks, schools, homes, and businesses instead of vehicles in populated urban areas. Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand, which translates into more cars everywhere if roads are widened and parking spots are created.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These online activists also underline that not everyone can simply buy and drive a vehicle. They say children, teenagers, impoverished parents and adults, and those unable to drive suffer a lot in \u001ccar-centric cities.\u001d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-car movement supporters also argue motor vehicles are dangerous. Occupants may benefit from increased levels of protection as automotive technology evolves and companies create new materials that are lighter, stronger, yet dissipate impact energy in a very efficient way, but those that are not in a car might not survive an impact with one \u0013 something that everybody knows since childhood. But these people insist exercising any *\u001cform of car-free liberty\u001d* is automatically linked to constant threat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They also say cars are nurturing isolation, since people don\u0019t meet so often to have a chat on a sidewalk. You may be inclined to bring up car communities and events, but keep in mind activists are only referring to city life. Urban dwellers might enjoy some more space for weekend activities or just walk to and from work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A change must happen, but not like this**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, the idea to ban cars remains a discussion on [a popular forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/). But the number of people that agree with this idea is frightening. It\u0019s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much, but giving up on fossil fuels and designing better cities might just do the trick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A change is clearly needed, but it can\u0019t happen without motor vehicles. They are an integral part of the U.S. (and the world) and of a major industry, while some certain models create entire communities, and even inspire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All in all, banning cars from public roads and crowded cities might be applicable in specific cases or in some locations, but the U.S. is not ready in any way, shape, or form to give up entirely on motor vehicles. New York City is already struggling with keeping traffic under control after they\u0019ve made more space for bicycles and buses. People have various needs when it comes to reaching different destinations, and we can\u0019t take the comfort of knowing they can go everywhere they need at any given time without offering a public infrastructure that\u0019s working continuously and without delays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle, be it a battery-electric or a fuel-cell (hydrogen) one.",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m.

This rhetoric is designed to kill all movement and political inspiration towards mass transit and a concerted transformation of how we move around our local space and the world at large. \n\nThey fight only to preserve auto manufacturers and car oriented infrastructure by shaming those who want an end to cars; they find it totally acceptable to abandon the radical demands for an evolution in movement for the \"cars will always exist, let's just make the best of it\" cop out garbage.\n\nBeyond climate degredation, cars fucking suck for myriad other reasons, the most profound of which is that they fucking kill tens of thousands of people a year in the US alone. Electric vehicles will still make our lives worse, prevent our cities and suburbs and villages from changing and connecting, send us to the hospital and the grave even, and for what? A pitiful reduction in carbon emissions that won't put us anywhere near the reductions we need to save the world as we know it? The preservation and proliferation of the private capital of auto manufacturers, which will continue to erode our lives and living spaces for its own gain? All Because some quasi auto industry shills had the gal to convince people around the world, who wanted REAL change, that cars (or personal vehicles, if you're reading this and really want to get pedantic about it) were just \"always going to exist\"? They fucking won't, and in time people will look back to this era of history and see cars as they are now with horror and perplexity, the same way we now regard the use of leeches to treat disease. No one could not possibly be groveling harder for corporate and private capitalist supremacy, the inherent political enemy of public transit and public well being. \n\nRadical voices might not be a majority, but it takes radical voices to inspire into the social imagination a new way of thinking about the world, to open the minds of the majority to the idea that our lives can exist completely without personal vehicles, that anywhere humans build settlement CAN be connected to reliable public transit, and that in such a world, our lives can be so much better. Electric vehicles won't, in even beyond-possible scenarios of success, save us from climate catastrophe. A fully mobilized transition to mass transit could actually give us a shot at avoiding catastrophe. To make this possible, it must first be imagined, it must be believed, and this is a perfect space to contribute to that imagination, but it's terribly impeded from happening when so many car brains brigade any given thread with their fresh-from-the-shit-spigot platitudes commanding that everyone get in line with the neo-liberal agenda. \n\n\nThis place is called Fuck Cars, and I say that we all get on board with the idea that Fuck Cars means Fuck ALL Cars",

      "text": "Since their start, Tyre Extinguishers has often appeared in this sub, drawing praise and criticism. Not everyone in this sub appreciates deflating tyres of SUVs to make a point.\n\nAs a result, all TX posts see a flood of similar comments opposing their actions. Unfortunately, many arguments are based on misunderstanding what TX actually is and does or what direct action entails.\n\nWhile obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it would be a shame if we kept running around and regurgitating the same talking points. So, to help the discussion move along, here's a list of commonly used thoughts on why TX sucks, with a short reaction.\n\n\\---\n\n* **This will only aggravate SUV drivers and turn them against your cause.**  \nEverything you do to prevent people from driving more and larger SUVs will turn SUV drivers against you. To quote a wise man or woman: 'If a protest doesn't inconvenience, it's not a protest; it's a picnic.' TX is not looking to make friends with drivers. They want unnecessary SUVs off the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is dangerous. Letting people drive around with deflated tyres is incredibly irresponsible.**  \nTX leaves a leaflet on the windshield to alert drivers that their tyres are deflated. That, combined with possible warning lights in the car and the fact that any driver will quickly notice a flat tyre, means the real chance of someone driving off with their flat tyre is negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **So now a diesel-powered tow truck has to make extra trips to get the SUV back on the road? I'm suddenly pretending to be hyper-focused on emissions, and this seems counter-productive.**  \nThe goal of deflating tyres is not to reduce the number of trips of that particular vehicle. Instead, TX is after the large-scale systemic change by spreading its message far and wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Some people live where a car is the only option, you know?**  \nThen TX will be no problem. They clearly state they only operate in urban environments. So nobody will have their tyres deflated in the suburbs or rural areas. Not by TX, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is not an effective way to spread your message.**  \nLiterally, hundreds and hundreds of news articles from all over the world, including some really nuanced background stories in some of the most prominent outlets, beg to differ. TX has been remarkably effective in spreading its anti-SUV arguments to the general audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Imagine being a single mother with three jobs/a poor worker just trying to get by and finding your tyres deflated, with no money to call roadside service and now you lose your job and whaa-whaa!**  \nTX clearly states they target posh vehicles in upscale neighbourhoods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **What if people need to haul stuff for their work? Or need a large vehicle to store their wheelchair?**  \nTX clearly states they don't target vehicles clearly marked as for work or for disabled or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This will do nothing to reduce the number of cars on the road.**  \nTX clearly states they are against SUVs and large 4x4s in urban area's. They are unnecessarily dangerous and polluting. TX are not anti-car per se.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Why target innocent individuals? They should target oil companies/car manufacturers/car dealers/politicians instead!**  \nPlease look at this handy '[Moderates guide to doing absolutely nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/y30j3q/based_on_actual_conversations_on_this_sub/)' made especially for you.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **We support slashing tyres now?**  \nTX doesn't slash tyres. They deflate them. Pump 'em back up, and SUVs are back on the road; message sent, no damage done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I've thought up a scenario where someone who doesn't deserve it is still terribly inconvenienced by their flat tyre. But I bet you haven't considered that, huh?!**  \nSince around 35 million SUVs were sold in 2021 alone (roughly 45 per cent of all cars sold), and TX claims to have deflated 10,000 vehicles in just over half a year, that scenario is implausible.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I heard they deflate the tyres of eSUVs and hybrids as well, proving my theory that they are not environmentalists, just hooligans.**  \nElectric or hybrid SUVs are still unsafe and, in many cases, unnecessary. Furthermore, tailpipe emissions are not the only pollution. Besides the large carbon footprint these enormous cars have, tyre wear causes tremendous particle pollution. eSUVS are typically heavier and have more torque, causing more strain on tyres and thus polluting more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I understand their point, but I am against touching people's personal stuff.**  \nFair enough. But remember that SUVs are more dangerous for those not inside that vehicle, take up more public space and emit more pollution for you to breathe in. They mess with you personally every day, and drivers seem to either not know or not care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **If you want to get your point across, why not attend a protest? Why not take up a role in your local government? Why not do this or that?**  \nAll of those things can exist together. Disruptive direct action is not a substitute for protesting or actively shaping policy. It's an addition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **There are better ways to protest.**  \nPlease leave them in the comments so we can learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTX have [a website](https://www.tyreextinguishers.com/) where you can read what they do and why they do it.

They use twice as much energy for the same range as a smaller car. \n\nSomething I also found while researching this mess is that particulate air pollution from tyre wear is already worse than tailpipe emissions in Europe. \n\nI would be surprised if electric pickups weren't actively worse for the environment than regular ICE or hybrid versions because of how inefficient they are, how many minerals they require, and how much more tyre wear they cause from the extra weight. \n\nIt's a little frustrating that EVs (specifically SUVs and trucks) are being pushed and even funded by the government as a green solution. I feel like it might distract from the bigger issue, which is that cars and car-centrism are unsustainable as a whole.",

Nothing against it and I welcome new people joining with the normal NA idea of car dependence. I just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same way as I did with recent discussions on this sub. Which apparently a lot of people have felt it too. Which is ok. I'm glad people are joining the discussion so this sub isn't a circle jerk.

      "text": "And all of this under a post showing how the US lost much of its train network through the decades, ironically enough. Seriously where do people get this idea and how do we convince people that it's not a conspiracy? \n\nThe question is kind of rhetorical as many people making such claims have per-confirmed beliefs which say otherwise (which automatically means they're right to them despite not posting any sources) and will not listen to reason no matter how sound it is.\n\nYou're telling me that car manufacturers making bigger and bigger vehicles (US ones in particular as this wasn't the norm in the world) for seemingly no reason, suddenly saying how everyone needs all of that \"utility and size\" and phasing out smaller, older cars and their parts isn't them manipulating the market and making people pay more for more fuel inefficient, dangerous vehicles. (And I fucking love how apparently the entire US suddenly lives in a secluded part of the country in some log cabin with no electricity, with having to drive 50 miles through ice and snow, and they say they all need their trucks, riiiiiiiight)\n\n  \nYou're telling me they didn't lobby politicians to build more roads and highways, often bulldozing poor, POC neighbourhoods which were areas of dense housing, and if it wasn't that it was bulldozed to construct bunch of samey looking single family homes (with car garages ofc).\n\nYou're telling me, that, back when cars were first introduced en masse, they caused a bunch of crashes but didn't try to victim blame pedestrians so they can make roads more friendly for cars. Yeah a world that was so used to walking on roads were all very happy suddenly that roads were excluded from walking on said roads, totally.\n\nYou're telling me that, despite the US being very similar to the rest of the world before cars and that almost every town and village had some rail connecting them to larger cities, it's just that rail fell out of favour and no one was using it anymore suddenly (because buying cars worth thousands was apparently a very enticing financial decision), so that's why rail closed down has got nothing to do with the auto industry.\n\nYou're also telling me that it's not the autoindustry's fault that public transit, dense housing, better cycling infrastructure and such faces MASSIVE backlash and protests from people who they totally didn't carwash? (Reminder, Elon Musk admitted to sabotaging the Californian High Speed Rail project)\n\nLet's also not mention other dumb shit which the auto industry totally didn't try to play down and play dumb... Like adding lead to fuel, ignoring warnings and its sideffects for... decades... \n\nEven if all of this was just a huge coincidence (it absolutely wasn't), then it's the dumbest, most unfortunate and selfish (and in some conscious decisions, extremely vile and racist ) set of circumstances the US (and other parts of the world) got themselves into.\n\nSo, what the fuck? How do you even keep up with these mental gymnastics? I'm asking as a genuine question.\n\nI get it, all corporations bend the truth and play dirty tricks for profits, but why is it suddenly the car and oil industry that were angels the whole time?",

It ended production of the eUp (the electric version of the Up) last year. We urgently need legislation that limits the size of cars. It's ridiculous that they are ending sales of these sorts of cars to force people into buying more expensive, larger and dangerous models.\n\nWhen I moved to the UK from the Middle East, I went from driving a LWB Mitsubishi Shogun to an Up. Sure it was underpowered, but I absolutely loved it. Parking went from being a chore to being almost fun.\n\nWe absolutely should be looking to reduce the number of cars in our cities and towns, but these are precisely the types of cars that should be left at the end of that purge; not the massive wankpanzers these companies seem insistent on selling.",

I bought one last year, because my car died, and I needed a vehicle on the cheap - because well, without one, getting to work is impossible. \n\nI hate how the SUV gets lousy gas mileage like a small truck, with much less ability to do truck like stuff. \n\nI hate how SUVs are built on car platforms but with truck style bodies to make them have the ability to drive like a car, but sway like a school bus if you have to swerve out of the way. \n\nI hate how consumerist the SUV is! Look at all the shit you can haul!!! Like we didn\u0019t have vehicles that could hold all your shit before. \n\nI hate how they are basically pedestrian killers. They sit higher, they are loaded with screens to take your eyes off the road, and well, since they are heavier than a normal car, take more time to stop. \n\nI got into bike riding a year ago. Hardcore. Road, gravel, MTB - love it all. I enjoy traveling by bike. Being able to appreciate the world around me, feeling the wind, not being bound to a road. \n\nThe area in which I live is bound by roads. Poorly maintained roads that have also not at all kept up with the growth of the area. Driving absolutely sucks here. I hate doing it. Also, what are we mainly driving for? To go to work. To pay for the car that gets us to work. \n\nI\u0019m tired of hearing about how much taxes would go up to have competent public transportation. Are you seriously thinking it would be more than the weekly fueling up, the monthly insurance payment, the car payment, or if paid off, the inevitable service costs of maintaining a car? I think not.  Also, adequate public transportation would probably reduce road maintance costs, reduce our need for petroleum, give us a few more green spaces, multi use trails, and maybe a few less hours at work, because the expenses aren\u0019t so high. \n\nAnd the SUV is the perfect device to keep us plugging along, ignoring the whole problem they created. \n",

I'm in support of electric buses or public transit for example, but individual cars are the problem.\n\nI'm willing to be persuaded if someone knows more about it.

One recent study cited in the paper found that the only path to meaningful emissions reduction that still allowed for VMT growth required both 80 percent of the vehicle fleet to be electrified by 2050, and the total decarbonization of the electrical grid \u0014 and even then, it just barely squeaked in under the line. Meanwhile, experts estimate that only 30 percent of cars will have batteries by midcentury.\n\n&gt;Or, as the report authors put it bluntly: \"The U.S. will not be able to decarbonize the transportation sector by midcentury without addressing increased demand.\" \n\n&gt;That harsh reality was also underscored in more subtle ways throughout the report, which routinely placed policies that support biking, walking, transit, and other non-automotive modes at the top of its various lists of decarbonization strategies.\n\n&gt;Specifically, DOT says the agency and all of its partners in government will need to \"increase convenience\" by decreasing the distance Americans need to travel to key destinations (and the safety they can expect along the journey), as well as \"improving efficiency\" by supporting mass transportation and better freight strategies.\n\n&gt;\"Increasing clean options\" like electric vehicles was the third item on its list. \n\n(editorial continues)\n\nChart: https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2024/07/AEO-chart.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75\n\n[https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change)\n\nFound the post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/1efhtm9/usdot_warns_congress_that_americans_need_to_drive/ (do not vote if you're not a subscriber there)",

I can rely on DoorDash/uber and some people have been nice enough to offer rides around but still the loss of autonomy is kind of depressing. It's annoying that pro-car people always insist that cars are better for the disabled. Yeah, I am sure for some people with disabilities car centric society is a plus, but I think it harms just as many people as it helps. Blind people for example are harmed by car centric society. Not to mention the fact that even if someone's mobility is inhibited, driving from point a to point b does not solve the fact that they still cannot easily get around. Walking is still required in almost all aspects of car-centric society with the exception of drivethrus. You have to walk form the parking lot to the store. For example, if someone was paralyzed and needed an electric wheelchair, they need specialized van to transport their wheelchair and someone to drive for them if they cannot, whereas if they lived in a walkable neighborhood, they could simply use the electric wheelchair to get around. The addition of the vehicle is a hinderance not a benefit to these people. \n\nIf I lived in a place that was more walkable, I could take my crutches/scooter and at least go to a coffee shop or something to get some fresh air but instead I am shelled up in a suburban apartment and have to pay $21+ for an Uber to get anywhere. Instead of the disabled being integrated in modern society, car-centric infrastructure kind of shoves them to the wayside if they cannot drive, Especially if you are low income and unable to afford living in a walkable area.

      "text": "For some backstory, I live in the state of Florida which often has flooding, hurricanes, similar things which require evacuation from an area. \n\nWhen I\u0019m discussing car dependency and car based infrastructure with my family, my mom points out often that since we live in a state that requires evacuation it\u0019s better to be car dependent so that we can leave faster, especially so considering we live on the coast so we are much more prone to the natural disasters.\n\nShe uses this argument to also show that combustion vehicles are better than electric vehicles because it takes longer to charge an electric vehicle. This point is really dumb though because you can charge your EV over night at your home and you\u0019re probably much more likely to have more range with an EV at any given time, compared to a combustion car. Also, EVs don\u0019t use much power while idling in traffic (which would probably be the case if there is an emergency and EVERYONE is trying to leave)\n\nBack to the original point, what would places like, for example, the Netherlands, New York City, I guess some places in California, etc do if there is a disaster and they need to evacuate? Given that many of those evacuating do not have access to a vehicle.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the responses! Also, no, this is not something I believe, it was a point my mom made and I wanted to find a refutation. You know how these people are, they find one thing and stick to it as the whole argument despite there being 50 counter arguments. (Clarifying because I got two really rude messages lol)",

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

      "title": "I\u0019m sick and tired of the same excuses drivers come up with to continue burning gasoline on a warming planet",
      "text": "Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:\n\n**\u001cMy emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d**\n\nThis is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth\u0019s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t afford an electric car.\u001d**\n\nNo one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There\u0019s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\u001d**\n\nYou *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dDriving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nCommute times should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cThere\u0019s no infrastructure to bike where I live.\u001d**\n\nAny road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThe infrastructure isn\u0019t ready yet.\u001d**\n\nWe don\u0019t have time: not only is our planet\u0019s climate destabilizing, it\u0019s destabilizing quickly. We can\u0019t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it\u0019s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.\n\n**\u001cMy workplace is out of reach of biking distance.\u001d**\n\nConsider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can\u0019t, then consider finding another job that\u0019s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn\u0019t be the priority when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI\u0019m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.\u001d**\n\nUnless you\u0019re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t carry my groceries on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThere\u0019s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t ride a bike in the cold.\u001d**\n\nWear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cNot everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThen go for an adult tricycle instead. Don\u0019t set that option aside so quickly when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThere wouldn\u0019t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.\u001d**\n\nIf more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet\u0019s climate from destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t like waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nBring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI don\u0019t like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d**\n\nComfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dHow can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\u001d**\n\nAre you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?\n\n**\u001dYour use of a device that\u0019s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we\u0019re focusing on.\n\n**\u001d[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.\n\nThe bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren\u0019t insignificant at all. You can\u0019t shift the blame on \u001ccorporations\u001d or \u001cinfrastructure\u001d when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.\n\nEDITS:\n\nIt turns out r/fuckcars has *way* more car apologists hiding among its members than one would expect!\n\nDrinking game!

Cars are just inherently bad for the environment not just through direct emissions because they require a lot of space which means more forests have to be paved over for roads and parking lots, said surface parking lot creates the urban heat island effect, cars are inefficient and they don't last long mostly due to planned obsolescence, cars kill so many animals directly through road-kill, and cars kill thousands of people each year, and the \"self-driving\" feature of Tesla cars are flawed and shady.\n\nD. Tesla cars burst into flames.\n\nHowever, my primary reason for hating Telsa has to be Elon Musk. Rant warning: Elon Musk is a racist, white South \"African\" i.e settler who got rich off of his parents' emerald mine, has a fucking cult of stans who worship him like he's a God Emperor, and attacks anyone who questions their messiah, and turned Twitter (I refuse to call it X) into a cesspool of racist, reactionary content. He uses child labor in the lithium mines, abuses the workers in the Tesla factories, disregarding their safety, and is just a giant piece of shit. Fuck Elon Musk, Fuck his culty stans, and if anyone drives a Telsa car, note that they are complicit in child labor and exploitation and that they're giving money to a racist piece of shit.\n\n(I know there's no ethical consumption under our current system, but at least try to minimize the impact by not purchasing products from companies that openly practice unethical procedures).\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Tesla is number one on my list of most hated auto manufacturers with Ford being a close second for similar reasons as Henry Ford was an anti-Semitic piece of shit. Let me know what's number one on your list and your reasoning for that. Take care, and stay safe.",

      "text": "# TLDR - Follow the instructions in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/KidSafeSF/status/1661425605911642112). Try to call during business hours. After that, sign [this petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/support-gap-funding-for-public-transportation)\n\n* The state budget is due in a couple of weeks, and the current draft will defund transit. If we don't stop this, public transportation in California could be set back generations, with some agencies lost entirely. Visit [https://www.savecaliforniatransit.org](https://www.savecaliforniatransit.org) for more info\n* Suggested talking points are included, but please tell your own personal story if you can\n* Asm. Ting only represents San Francisco, but all Californians should still call in. He's the budget chair, so he has disproportionate power and is the main person blocking transit funding. Be honest, if you're not a San Franciscan then state which assembly district you are from\n* After calling Ting's office, additionally try to call your own assemblymember, your state senator, and the governor's office! You may also use [this tool](https://sftransitriders.salsalabs.org/2023budget/index.html) to send an email, although calling is best if you can\n* San Francisco is the 2nd most transit-dependent city in the nation. Tell the assemblymember that if he kills BART, he'll be remembered as the man who killed San Francisco\n* Signing the petition will also add you to an email list so you can stay updated on the fight to save California's transit\n\n*That's all you really need to know, feel free to ignore the rest of this post. Additional context is available below for anyone who's interested*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPublic transit agencies in California are in a tough situation. By American standards, we have better-than-average transit (low bar!), and accordingly our transit systems have relatively high ticket revenues. Agencies grew dependent on these fares for their budget, and suffered greatly when Covid knocked out the reliable commuter market. Although ridership is recovering, the recovery is not fast enough to plug the budget holes.\n\nCurrently there is [a proposal](https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1650901636355883009), championed by Sen. Scott Weiner &amp; others, which would not only save our transit systems but also make them better than ever. $5B in operations funding, tied directly to accountability &amp; reform requirements. For the first time, this state could have adequate funding for transit, alongside meaningful oversight to ensure it is used correctly.\n\nHowever, many voices in the state government are opposing this funding, most notably [Asm. Ting](https://twitter.com/cyrusphall/status/1657144633531711489) and [Gov. Newsom](https://twitter.com/orkoliberal/status/1657216211447578624/photo/1). There is a budget deficit, but it seems disingenuous considering that Weiner's proposal is self-funding, and we're not even considering cutting any of the tens of billions in the highway budget.\n\nThis may be confusing, as you've probably heard of all the funding that's been allocated by the Biden administration, and all the new projects underway in California. However, these grants are generally only allowed to be used on capital projects, which is to say new infrastructure and vehicles. The funds that actually pay for operators and fuel are known as operating funds. These are traditionally covered by fares &amp; state-level funding, both of which are currently lacking. We're ironically headed for a situation where the feds are building us lots of new infrastructure, and our agencies won't have the ops funds to use it. I realize that transit funding can be a bit wonky, so check [this presentation](https://t4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/James-Corless-Indy-academy-5-14-15.pdf) for more context\n\nThere's [a large coalition of organizations](https://www.savecaliforniatransit.org/#h.pi7ad553kzh3) fighting to ensure that transit funding gets into the budget. Frankly, we're losing, and things don't look good if they keep going how they're going. Assuming nothing changes, BART and Caltrain will be the first to collapse in 2025-26. The small bus agencies serving mid-sized towns &amp; suburbs will follow. San Jose's VTA and the LA Metro have the longest runways, with strong local funding, but even their budgets will run out by 2030. Muni may survive, but it will be a fraction of its former self, with 20 bus routes on the chopping block this year alone\n\nThe various transit agencies in California haven't always been perfectly run, and that's part of the reason why Phil Ting and others want to defund these systems. But the reality is, destroying our existing transit agencies won't magically make things better. The real answer is adequate funding accompanied by meaningful oversight. Please call Asm. Ting's office, sign the petition, and get involved in saving California's public transportation",

      "text": "Cars are probably one of the dumbest and most wasteful ways you could try to move billions of people around from A to B every day. The average weight of a car is 1300kg, the average weight of a person is  62kg, which means when a person drives to work, over 95% of the energy, resources, space consumed and pollution goes into moving the car itself. Then when you're at work, the car just sits there most the day, taking up space and resources, not being utilised. It's so wasteful, individual transport is just plain stupid. Cars spew out pollution, changing the climate and filling our air with toxic fumes. We breath in micro-particles contained in the exhaust of cars, particles so small they pass through cell membranes and fuck with us, give us cancer and all sorts of diseases. The toxic fumes of cars stink, the engines are noisy, even the wheels are noisy. Endless piles of tyres build up, because cars are designed to need disposable products like wheels.\n\nCars are what you get when the free market is left to decide how we live, there is no plan with cars, it's just millions of individual consumers and companies all deciding to do what is individually good for them, with no greater plan, no coordination, just the wasteful and ignorant direction of the free market producing the cluster fuck on civilisation that is cars and the roads they require. With cars you are forever remaking billions of individual vehicles as each one lives a mere generation, all the while you're constantly remaking endless stretches of roads which eventually crack and wear under the weight of all those cars and trucks. It's madness on a monumental scale, a scale so vast that it changes the landscape and climate of the entire planet.\n\nSo what could we do differently? Almost anything would be better.  Personally I'm an electrified train and tram guy, I think bikes can fill in the gaps, especially electric bikes. I think that if we took a tiny fraction of what we spend on cars collectively as individuals and governments, then applied this tiny fraction to electrified trains, trams, cycling infrastructure and subsidies on bikes and ebikes, we wouldn't want cars. For those situations where the collective system doesn't work, we could always have a few electrified cabs, but those situations are rare in a transportation system organised correctly. The collective benefits from the efficiency, the fresh air, the quiet, the enormous cost savings and sustainability would all make up for any loses to select individuals. Then there are the car enthusiasts, but they're dumb enough that they'd forget about cars quickly enough, besides, they could always just get fucked and find a hobby that doesn't destroy the planet.\n\nI'm also a big believer in relocalisation, alternative systems of planning that don't rely on the free market to decide where people live, systems that have intelligent planning and would produce communities where people live near where they work and can just ride a bike, walk or catch a tram. We often forget that a big part of the problem is that people often live hours from where they work, this is insanely inefficient for billions to be travelling so far every day, simply because the system responsible for organising where individuals live has no intelligence behind it at all and doesn't optimise anything for anyone.\n\nIf I could live in a world without cars I would, but for now as this is just a dream, I'll take solace in the fact that there are others out there like me that find the whole transportation situation in our modern world one of the biggest, dumbest spectacles that this planet will ever have the misfortune of witnessing.",

Cars use case is mostly rural where the density isn\u0019t justifying the public transport except for the cheapest &amp; most unreliable one possible and the land is on discount.\n3. EV crank it to 11 because rural electricity is by it\u0019s nature is subsidized by city where the density allow cheaper electricity (thanks to economy of scale) which enables said city grid to subsidize the area around the city (the suburbs) but any city that know what they\u0019re doing (Tokyo, Amsterdam, most German city, Paris, London, Singapore) know that suburbs still have to be given a coverage of public transport because eventually people that lived in suburbs works in the metro and if they\u0019re allowed to bring in their cars it will cause the same problem with the car ownership in the downtown regardless of the legality of owning cars in downtown.\n\nWhy cars are oversaturated:\n1. We never have a actual invention of new car technology since Hybrids (EV first prototype was more than century old) which made the technological barrier to this industry relatively small compared to let\u0019s say a chip fab.\n2. Which makes every country down to the low income countries that have a industrial base like China, Russia &amp; India to be able to make their own cars (albeit with varied success in capturing the market share).\n3. Compound that with some country like China, Japan, South Korea implementing textbook fascism and transfer everything (including confiscated bank deposit (in China case)) to the manufacturing of cars to make sure that there\u0019s no mass unemployment regardless of the demand of said cars &amp; the other car producing countries reaction to said textbook fascism move.

      "title": "Any other adult non-drivers here who feel like the world isn't built for you?",
      "text": "Just discovered this sub today. Don't know why the algorithm never recommended it given my history and interests. Can't tell based on the introductory stuff how much of the membership is adult non-drivers, though.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I figured I'd start driving just like everyone else. But when I got behind the wheel for the first time, I was shocked by how it felt. Nothing like I expected. I literally couldn't control the car -- it felt exactly like it ALWAYS wanted to turn left or right and that I could not make it go straight. It looks literally effortless when literally everyone I see drive drives, from real life to movies and tv, but when I had to do it, it felt IMPOSSIBLE. I couldn't and still can't for the life of me understand how anyone does it. No one can explain what they're doing that I'm missing. I get the centipede's dilemma, but this is ridiculous.\n\nDifferent vehicles, different environments, different parent trying to help made no difference in my utter inability to grasp how humans control or direct cars. The first question everyone asks when I reveal this is, Do I have dyslexia? No. Never been diagnosed with anything else, either. I wear glasses because I'm terribly nearsighted, but that's it. No problems with depth perception or balance or dizziness -- I can control a bike and an electric bike just fine, after all -- and it's not even a physical difficulty anyway. I simply can't make a car go straight (or any direction I want), and nobody can tell me why or how they do it. Yes, I've tried again as an adult, and it felt just as impossible as when I was a  teenager. Technically, I'm sure I could keep digging with the help of doctors and find a reason, which could be fixable, but I've chosen not to -- I don't want to risk my and others' lives for something that's not necessary.\n\nSo I've gotten to age 36 in Pittsburgh, PA with no driver's license. I took all road trips by train or bus until I got over my fear of flying during the pandemic. As for local transportation, I began bicycling almost everywhere in college and continue to get around primarily by bike and bus. I got an electric bike 3 years ago, but learned to my surprise and horror that using it affected my ability to ride a regular bike, so it's tragically been sitting the garage for 2 years. I've taken 3 major multi-night bike trips so far (I would do it every year if not for money).\n\nFrom one angle, being a full-time bus rider and bicyclist is 100% doable in my city.  I used my passport for all ID needs until it was about to need renewed. I then used my passport to get a non-driver's state ID, and then used said state ID to renew my passport. I only apply for jobs in places I know I can easily get to by multiple bus or light rail lines, but by coincidence, I've been able to bike to almost every job I've had. I work office jobs (been a legal assistant for the past several years) that don't require a driver's license (so far, only ever applied for 1 promotion 2 employers ago where they rejected me solely for not having a driver's license even though no duties involved driving). I sometimes pick up groceries using my panniers that say \"One Less Car\" but usually use the bus on my way home from work. I can take the cats to the vet on the bus in their carriers. I shamelessly utilize a lot of delivery services like Instacart because in addition to working full time, I'm the primary caregiver for my 100 yr old grandfather, my disabled roommate, and 3 cats and have no guilt about using anything that can help me save time on all the chores and duties I have to fulfill. It's 100% possible to live and function in enough neighborhoods in my city without a car.\n\nBut from another angle, that very fact makes it so frustrating that the world isn't built for people like me. Everywhere you look, the structure reflects how it was designed with the assumption that every visitor or user will have a car. Sure, I can walk up the hills and across dangerous interactions in sprawling shopping plazas, but would it be so hard to construct paths for pedestrians who want to shop? Sure, I have a great pair of waterproof snowboots, but cars get a clear path in winter while I have to stomp through the snow -- is that really fair? We have a few bike lanes, but their locations seem arbitrary, not like they actually make running errands any easier.\n\nI hope it's okay to say the pandemic and Great Resignation have only made things worse. For example, there's a Wendy's literally down the block and right around the corner from our house, but they stopped allowing people inside in March 2020 and are still drive thru only in 2023. This means that the only reason I can't walk down and get food for the same price as other customers is because I don't own a car. I know, first world problems, but if you're going to only serve customers who own a car, at least admit it -- post a sign saying you don't serve people who don't own a car unless they pay twice as much for delivery. If you can't retain enough employees to keep the lobby open, fine, but why can't you allow people to even place an online order and physically walk inside and pick it up? How much more labor can that require? You could put the bags on a shelf where people can walk in and grab it with no employee needing to do anything! How is that more labor than if a Grubhub or Doordash driver for the order went through the drive thru? Nope, if you don't own a car, you're not worthy of being our customer, and you're not welcome here. This was pervasive in 2020, but with no reason for \"nobody allowed inside\" now but lack of employees, it's really frustrating to come across businesses that have decided anybody who doesn't own a car is so far beneath their notice that it's not worth giving them an easy, obvious, common way to pick up an order that doesn't require any more labor than the drive thru does. Not only are non-drivers freaks who don't deserve consideration, they don't exist -- after all, who DOESN'T drive everywhere?\n\nOn occasions where I have to think about it, this \"everyone drives\" mentality and the resulting world built for cars (where I live, anyway) alternates between making me roll my eyes and shake my head and the irrationality and feeling depressed. I live closer to the way the anti-global warming media says I should... and I get punished for it with arbitrary restrictions and unnecessary obstacles! Meanwhile, the people using and relying on what so many now call evil and dirty are rewarded with a system that caters to them. Hell, yeah, fuck cars and the narrowminded urban planners and business owners who were never taught what a bike is!",

      "title": "Sending a letter to the BBC about their recent quiz",
      "text": "A day or so ago, the BBC posted a [quiz](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348) about how we as individuals can minimize our CO2 emissions based on a [meta-analysis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/pdf) of 6,992 studies. The study of course, was not about individual choices, saying \"Here we argue that a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches provides a robust base for the review of the mitigation potentials of consumption options.\"\n\nIn question 3 on the BBC, they ask \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" However, the study found that the \"best transport choice\" is neither of these. The study found, \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options\" (their emphasis).\n\nSo, I am typing an email to the BBC's corrections department, to change question 3 to accurately represent the study to say that living car-free is the best transportation option.\n\nIn case they decide to re-word the question to ask \"Which is the better transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" I am also arguing that the study does a poor job of accounting for the real-world factors of Tesla vs. bus, namely:\n\n1. it does not account for CO2 emissions from construction of the vehicle.\n2. it does not ask where the electric car gets its electricity from.\n3. it does not make a traffic analysis; use of mass transit makes fossil-fuel cars less polluting by reducing traffic\n4. it assumes only short urban trips can be replaced with mass transit; the study found that public transit has CO2 emissions as low as 0.00-0.09 kg/km depending on the fuel source, since public transit is sometimes electrified anyway. Looking only at the exhaust pipe (which our study does), mass transit and electric cars are almost identical.\n\n.\n\nI provide my letter below and invite everyone to restate it in your own words asking that Question #3 be corrected to \"living car-free.\" The part about comparing electric vs mass is optional.\n\n.\n\nTo: [newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk](mailto:newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk) \\[newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk\\]\n\nBBC,\n\nI recently saw your quiz ([https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348)) on how individuals can make personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint. Your quiz was based on [this University of Leeds study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/meta). Question 3 asks \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate?\" The study found that \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options,\"  (emphasis theirs). However, your quiz only lists \"electric car\" and  \"public transport\" as options for \"the best transport choice.\" The  correct answer in your quiz, according to the study, should be \"Living  car-free.\"\n\nBut  even if we wanted to compare electric cars to mass transit and ask the  better choice, there are four important aspects of the study to  consider.\n\n1. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe. Obviously electric is  zero, but mass transit varied between 0.00 kg/km (for electric buses  and trains) to 0.09 kg/km. Compare that to fossil fuel cars, which the  study found to have emissions between 0.6 and 3.6 depending on the  model, and electric and mass transit are almost identical. The study  assumed that mass transit would only replace \"short and urban car  trips,\" meaning the other trips were calculated as being done with a  fossil-fuel car. It's not a fair comparison.\n2. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the electric power plant it charges from. [This study](http://idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/Tesla_Motors.pdf) found that Tesla electric cars still generated 0.0461 kg/km when the grid is based on natural gas.\n3. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the CO2 released from production of the vehicle. [This Politifact article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/11/viral-image/producing-electric-cars-battery-does-not-emit-same/)  notes that just producing one electric car's battery can generate  between 4,500 and 7,500 kg of CO2, depending on the electricity source  of the factory. While buses also emit CO2 just by being built, this  value should be divided by its average ridership, which unfortunately  the Leeds study does not touch on.\n4. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering a traffic analysis. If more people take mass transit, there is less  traffic on the road, meaning the fossil-fuel-burning cars become more  fuel efficient. If they are replaced with electric cars, there is no reduction in traffic.\n\nThe  study is very helpful for a lot of reasons, but question number 3  should not be a comparison between electric cars and mass transit. It  should simply state that the \"best transport choice\" is living car-free,  as the study reports.\n\nBest regards,\n\n***\\[your IRL name\\]***\n\n***\\[your IRL email address\\]***",

      "text": "I had originally typed this up as a comment, but I decided to make it a full text post. \n\nIf we build our cities to be more walkable, while keeping accessibility in mind, then people who have difficulty walking will *also* have an easier time getting around. \n\nDo you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to get an electric wheelchair in and out of a vehicle? Have you ever tried to cram a folded manual wheelchair into the trunk of a compact car? Do you know how expensive any form of wheelchair-friendly private transportation is, whether you own that vehicle or not? It sucks! Right now, many disabled people have to rely on cars driving up close to the building. \n\nBut, if more people lived in more walkable places (that were also accessible to mobility devices), then they could get around their own neighborhoods much more freely. Instead of switching between transportation modes multiple times in a simple trip (which is exhausting), they could just use one mode the entire time, just like abled people do when they walk somewhere. I\u0019ve watched disabled family members struggle with getting in and out of the car, trying to park as close as possible, and leaning on a shopping cart the whole time they\u0019re in a big box store. They couldn\u0019t easily go anywhere, so going out was necessities-only. But if they had a walkable neighborhood, well-kept sidewalks with curb cuts, and nearby markets? They could have gone out so much more easily, just by switching to a Rollator or wheelchair. (Well, it\u0019s hilly here, so maybe an electric wheelchair or some other electric-assisted device would be the best option.) \n\nMobility devices can be incredibly expensive. But cars are significantly more expensive, and in a car-dependent place, you don\u0019t have a choice. If I need to use a very expensive electric wheelchair, I have three choices: I could buy just the wheelchair, and either risk my life riding to the grocery store along a highway, or lose a big chunk of independence by needing someone else to drive me around. I could buy just the car, and go through the shitty song and dance described above. Or I could buy both, go through a different shitty song and dance, and also have the debt collectors beating down my door. Because unfortunately, being disabled in America often also means being poor. \n\nAll of this only addresses basic needs, like getting groceries or going to the doctor. Imagine if my disabled family members had actually been able to go to a park, or a library, or a hangout spot whenever they wanted to. They could only do that very rarely. \n\nLastly, there are a lot of people on the borderline of needing mobility aids. I\u0019m one of them! Sometimes I get horrible fatigue episodes where even sitting up unsupported is a struggle. But most of the time, I can walk around just fine. I don\u0019t own a wheelchair, and sometimes I have to rely on my car (or just stay in). My disabled family members are also on that borderline. It\u0019s not a black-and-white thing, where you\u0019re either paralyzed from the waist down or you can run miles every day. Disability is complicated. And when we\u0019re all trapped inside our houses, inside our cars, and leaning on shopping carts, it\u0019s easier to pretend we\u0019re not here. But disabled people have been here for as long as there have been people. Maybe more people using a wheelchair sometimes, and more people being visibly disabled more often, would reduce the stigma around looking disabled. \n\nTl;dr: disabled people only rely on cars in car-dependent places because they have to. Mobility aids become more useful, and neighborhoods become more accessible, when they are not centered around cars. Car-centric towns are more structurally ableist than accessible walkable towns.",

      "title": "Cars are the original antisocial behavior. ",
      "text": "There's long been a concept, 'broken windows' whereby once you let certain things slide, a sort of reverse gentrification takes over and that part of a town or city starts dying. \n\nI'd argue that the process more typically begins with planning or accommodating car use, and that this leads to a spiral of community destruction that has a role in the general increase in other types of antisocial behavior and crime. It leads to degeneration of civic and neighbourhood pride, causes children to be herded indoors, the lack of play leads to increased family stress, poorer child socialisation and increases in psychological problems, mental illness, impulse control problems and drug use and other negative behaviours, and health effects like morbid obesity. \n\nNoise is also one of the big factors affecting sleep and healthy development, but also we know of other factors like the historical lead poisoning. \n\nHow clear this is to me is thanks to a chance sequence of events that led to me moving away for some time from my car centric society (suburbs, Britain) to several towns and cities in western Ukraine. \n\nIn my current city, there is literally no need to own or use a car, unless you are miles out of city limits. Trans and trolley buses are extensively used. Urban population density is much higher than suberbs, most apartment blocks are 5 to 9 stories. \n\nThere is almost zero morbid obesity. Children and teenagers exhibit few signs of behavioural problems. There is play areas in every group of apartment buildings. Whilst their are parked cars, few cars are actually moving and there is no through roads in these spaces. Children play outside with a adult nearby from morning to night. There is no gangs, you would not worry that leaving your kids to roam as teenagers will get them drawn into hard drugs or crime, no signs of antisocial behavior except the odd drunk but they typically just mind themselves quietly. \n\nPolice stations are numerous and included in some of these apartment complexes. Shops occupy the first floor on all major streets. \n\nSo it's better than a 15 minute city for most things. \n\nBeing a parent here seems far easier when your kids can play outside your apartment block with other kids. As they grow older there are many safe spaces and parks and completely segregated cycle lanes. This extensive play seems to be vital for the development of children, and since the diet isn't particularly better in terms of junk food, I strongly feel explains the overall highly civil behavior of Ukrainians and the apparently improved behavior and lack of psychological and impulse problems in children and teens, who almost never exhibit threatening or antisocial behaviors. \n\nTraffic congestion and volumes are very light compared to western cities. It's eminently possible to go completely car free and rent a parking spot if you wanted a car at the city boundary. \n\nAnother interesting thing, there are curfews so no travelling outside after 12 midnight. This seems to have no negative impacts except make it quieter. The fact is cars are not needed in cities like this, with the exception of maybe disability vehicles for some users., and perhaps for some families. \n\nAlso, the electric micro scooters every authority seems to hate in the west, are very popular here and easily available for rent. I would estimate that on cycle lanes their use out numbers bike use by at least 2 to 1. Anything that makes cars seem more irrelevant is a good idea. One potential improvement could be a rentable cargo e bike scheme. \n\nEven towards the edges where big shed marts are to be found, these are usually served by tram stops, and an interesting thing that would strike you about these, is how much smaller the space used for parking is at these locations. One plot has a large mall, a car park that is so small that the space you would see taken up in the west for parking (and then some) is instead planned for being used to squeeze in a large multistory apartment block, of 12 or so stories.

The train is always full, most people take public transportation to the city because it has so many connections. Once I'm there with my friends we spend the entire day walking around, taking breaks to eat lunch/a snack/dinner somewhere and going into stores. Cars are not really 'allowed' in the capital city and if you need to go by car there are only 4 lanes, and most of the time they are for buses or sometimes taxis to take people to their hotel. If you drive your car to the city and you park for over a certain amount of minutes (can't remember exactly) you get a ticket. And there aren't even that many parking spots anywhere, only near hospitals and such, for obvious reasons.\n\nThere is a lot of greenery everywhere and people can rent bikes and electric scooters to visit the city instead of taking their car. There are also tour buses and small vehicles connected (?) to a bike where people sit and a guide drives them around. The city is old and the buildings are beautiful. \n\nThis is all thanks to plenty of car laws becoming effective years ago (because pollution was getting out of hand) and they started letting only the vehicles with an odd plate number one day and an even number the next day in the city center. Then they forbid the vehicles that came out before a certain year (2006 I think?) from going in. Soon it became difficult and tiring to even drive there and now most people take the train or bus and the 'cloud' of pollution over the city is starting to go away! The levels of pollution in most areas are green \\*which means good air quality\\* and only very few are yellow. I wish this happened to every city.

Here's a sampling of posts from *the past week* that covers the typical kinds of genres you'll see on there:\n\n* [Dangerously overinflated tires (should be at like 30 psi)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10ayq0u/defused_a_bomb_today/)\n* [People not understanding how their expensive vanity vehicles work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10aipy6/customer_complaint_it_steers_funny/)\n* [People driving with a missing wheel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/109zpfb/just_had_this_come_in_we_work_on_trailers_also/)\n* [Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10b6kjc/rust_belt_strikes_again/)\n* [Customers refusing dire repairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/107jnuv/he_said_the_belt_was_good_because_it_wasnt_making/)\n* [Stupid manufacturing and design](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1073fxz/vws_make_my_head_hurt_water_from_the_sunroof/)\n* [Evidence of bad work by previous mechanics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1063rg6/valvoline_instant_oil_change_drain_plug_removal/)\n* [Bald tires](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10acas2/i_dont_know_anything_about_cars_but_we_my_husband/)\n* [Dangerous electrical](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10av9d9/all_the_electricity_is_leaking_out/)\n* [People are sometimes just dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10b9xjq/getting_real_tired_of_these/)\n\n\nThe sub is an extremely deep well.\n\nThis is by no means intended to blame the end users. Cars are complex, expensive, and dangerous objects that inflict all kinds of psychological damage on people in car-centric transit infrastructure. We're pushed into debt to buy the newest bright-and-shinys, or can just barely afford a cheap car to begin with, then feel guilty when we can't afford to maintain them properly, a part of car ownership that is allowed to just go by the wayside in the US. To me, /r/Justrolledintotheshop provides reminders of just how normal it is a) to let car maintenance go completely to hell, b) for people's need for transportation to overcome the most insane and personally unsafe conditions, and c) for us to do nothing about it collectively because lost lives are considered an acceptable cost of driving even under optimal conditions, so what's a little more on the side?\n\n/r/Justrolledintotheshop is obviously a sub that likes cars and sees some consistent problems with how people use cars. But the users tend to indicate lack of personal responsibility as the culprit, hence the sub being dedicated to \"absolutely stupid things.\" Because it is true under any system that some portion of the population will act irresponsibly, it is obviously true that some car drivers neglect maintenance out of their own failings. But I think we can agree here that the scale of the problem is evidence of the fact that, *even if it is true* that tons of people are not inherently responsible enough to maintain a car, we shouldn't force everyone to own cars.",

      "title": "Why drive a Tesla when a WWII-era steam train can outdo it in emissions?",
      "text": "***WARNING: MATH AHEAD***\n\nSo recently, I watched an episode of the amazing podcast Well There\u0019s Your Problem, specifically episode 113 discussing battery-electric locomotives [1]. Around the 56 minute mark, host Justin Roczniak remarks that he and Tom Coletti did some \u001cback of the napkin math\u001d to determine the relative environmental impact of transporting passengers on a steam-locomotive powered train versus electric automobiles, and came to a pretty shocking conclusion about the break-even point. After seeing this, I was inspired to do the math myself and see if I could replicate his conclusions, here\u0019s what I found.\n\nWe\u0019ll start with the steam locomotive in question: for my math, I used Union Pacific FEF-3 locomotive number 844. This locomotive was built in 1944, and was frequently employed on passenger trains up until around 1957. Soon afterwards, it became one of the last surviving mainline steam locomotives still in use and was used from then onwards as a PR ambassador for the Union Pacific. This locomotive represents the state-of-the-art for steam locomotive design as it was when the art ended following WWII. \n\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the UP, the 844 has a fuel capacity of 6,200 gallons of No. 5 fuel oil, and one full tank will give the locomotive a range of approx. 300 miles [2]. This means that the engine burns around 21 gallons per mile. According to Climatiq, No. 5 fuel oil emits 10.24 kilograms of CO2e per gallon burned [3]. \n\n21gal per mile * 10.24kg CO2e per gal = 215.04kg of CO2e per mile\n\nTo make the math later on a little easier, I\u0019ll convert 215.04 kilograms to 215,040 grams.\n\nNext, let\u0019s take a look at the emissions from electric vehicles. Remember, although these vehicles do not directly pollute, the electric grid that these vehicles often get their charge from does. For my math, I decided to use the Tesla Model Y, simply for the fact that it is the best selling electric vehicle in the US. According to a study published to Statista, a Model 3 charged off of the US grid will emit 116 grams of CO2e per mile [4]. \n\nNow for the fun part. We\u0019ve established an apples-to-apples comparison for emissions from the 844 and the Model Y, so now we can simply divide and find the quotient:\n\n215040g / 116g H 1853.79\n\nSo it takes about 1854 Teslas to equal one 844 in terms of CO2e per mile. Assuming one person in each of those Teslas, how many passenger cars will the 844 need to pull in order to carry 1854 passengers? Let\u0019s give 844 the best shot possible by having it pull St Louis Car Company Bi-Level Commuter Coaches. These cars have a pretty high capacity of 169 seats per car, and when loaded have a weight of around 79 tons (62 tons for the empty car, plus 17 from the 169 200-pound passengers aboard) [5]. \n\n1854 / 169 H 10.97\n\nSo, with 11 passenger cars behind it, the 844 has broken even and produces less CO2e per mile than a fleet of Teslas. In the podcast, Justin says his math came out to about 10 cars, so we can say that his math is about right. Now for the even more important question, how fast can the 844 go with those 11 cars? Well, at 72 tons per car, this train would weigh 792 tons total. To find speed per train weight, I will refer to a set of charts used by the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 30s-early 40s to calculate tonnage ratings. On page 22, we see a chart for the FEF-1 class locomotives, which are similar enough to the FEF-3s to be comparable. At 792 tons, this train could reach nearly 100 MPH on flat track; just shy of 70 MPH on a 0.5% uphill grade; and just over 50 MPH on a 1% grade [6].\n\nTLDR:\n\nWhen pulling 11 bi-level commuter coaches, a 1944 steam locomotive produces less emissions per mile than if all the passengers in those coaches were to drive individual Teslas. Not only that, but this train could pull those coaches on flat track at a much higher speed than those Teslas could legally drive on our highways today, and at speeds similar to highways even when climbing hills. Keep all of this in mind whenever people try to tell you that electric vehicles are the way out of our current climate crisis. They aren\u0019t. Trains are.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0qcxyyllQ4\n[2]: https://www.up.com/heritage/steam/844/\n[3]: https://www.climatiq.io/data/emission-factor/d0440c0d-4ffc-4838-9079-43df928f54f3\n[4]: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401887/tesla-lifecycle-emissions-model-3-model-y-by-selected-countries-and-regions/#:~:text=While%20the%20emissions%20from%20a,Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.%2C%20respectively.\n[5]: https://www.irm.org/player/cnw1/?roster_type=custom\n[6]: https://utahrails.net/flebbe-papers/UP_Horsepower-Curves-and-Tonnage-Ratings-Charts.pdf\n",

And that, if leafy, could reject more heat.\n\nAlthough a component of long term temperature rise is caused by GHG, and some of that undoubtedly human, a big component of what humanity experiences as extreme heat is due to the additional urban heat island increasing over time from built area and human energy using activities.\n\nEdit, to be more accurate, I should say, that a lot of the long term trend of increased *experienced* extreme heat, is due to cars.",

      "title": "Concern over increase in anti e-scooter propaganda in Australian media",
      "text": "I attempted to post this article in r/Australia though had it deleted with no reason given, so figured I'd preach it to the choir instead :-) \n\nTL:DR at end.\n\nRecently there have been a flood of articles in Australian media with titles like \"Concerns increase in fires linked to lithium-ion batteries in e-scooters and e-bikes\". One online ABC article about the issue was originally posted with the false statement that \"Hundreds of e-scooters and e-bikes are catching fire in Australian homes...\" That wildly inaccurate bit of information has since been removed, but not before a [Google crawler indexed it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hundreds+of+e-scooters+and+e-bikes+are+catching+fire+in+Australian+homes)\n\nDespite media reports to the contrary, e-scooters and e-bikes are not bursting into flames at an alarming rate. Over 5.5 years to mid 2022, there were less than 100 lithium-ion battery fires in Australia reported to the ACCC; remember, a dozen or more lithium-ion battery containing products can be found in the average Australian home today, including in laptops, tablets, children's toys, drills, etc. [Only 9 (yes nine) of those fires were caused by batteries inside e-mobility devices.](https://consultation.accc.gov.au/accc/lithium-ion-batteries-issues-paper/supporting_documents/ACCC%20Lithiumion%20Batteries%20Issues%20Paper.pdf) Nine e-scooter and e-bike fires over 5.5 years, compared to 10's of thousands of car fires over the same period (speculative based on [&gt;9,000 car fires in NSW alone in just a 36-month period](https://www.fireextinguisheronline.com.au/blog/post/electric-vehicle-fire-extinguisher-australia)).\n\nSo why the media frenzy on these devices being a risk? Vehicle manufacturers and energy companies have been manipulating the media and controlling the narrative around transport options for 100 years now ([reference 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOttvpjJvAo), [reference 2](https://www.drilledpodcast.com/)), they are world renowned experts at [manufacturing consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU).\n\nIn urban areas, a substantial amount of the distance we drive is for short trips, easily achievable by e-mobility devices. In Sydney, [50% of all vehicle km driven are for trips less than 5km](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/HTS%20Report%20Sydney%202012-13.pdf). If we are allowed to view new e-mobility options as the cheap, convenient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, spatially sustainable, and relatively safe products that they are, then we'll stop driving cars as much as we do. In turn, we'd also start demanding governments do more to make our streets safer for those who aren't driving cars... which in turn will cause more people take up alternative transport options.\n\nLeft unchecked, e-mobility devices have the potential to significantly reduce the amount we drive cars in our cities; this will hurt the bottom line of amongst the richest and most powerful businesses in the world. Something they will not allow to happen without a fight. Their decades old signature move? Narrative control and media manipulation.\n\nTL:DR; E-scooters and e-bikes are not catching fire at the rate the media is portraying, not even remotely. It is likely the usual powers are at work to ensure the general public are terrified of any transport option that is not a privately owned car.",

      "text": "The title says it all, and I've just experienced two recent instances of drivers being absolute inconsiderate fucks on the road. Two days in a damn row, mind you. I live in the Inland Empire of Southern California, which, as much as I absolutely love, is unfortunately very heavily car-dependent. \n\nThe first was when I was riding my electric scooter to work yesterday morning. A driver in an older truck literally backed up on the right side of the fucking road, back to the intersection. I shit you not. Luckily, I stopped when the light turned red when the idiot was still backing up into the other road at the intersection. What an absolute dumbass. Like, who the fuck even does that shit? Why the fuck did they even turn right onto that street in the first place, then? \n\nThe second instance, though involving a motorcycle, literally just happened an hour ago. I was on a walk, and then this fucking idiot on a dirt bike was blocking the whole crosswalk while waiting for the light to turn green, even after I began crossing after waiting for the walk signal to appear. Well, right around when I finished crossing, this motherfucker decided it was a brilliant idea to just impatiently turn left onto a fucking sidewalk and just drive on it... where I just was a couple minutes back. Like, are you really that fucking inconsiderate of others and in that much of a rush? What if there was a pedestrian in front of them? The fuck is their problem?\n\nOh, yeah. Here's another similar story with another dirt bike rider. One afternoon, after I got off the bus after work, and as I walked up towards my house, yet another dumbass fucking idiot drove their dirt bike on the dirt off the street next to the sidewalk that I was walking on... in a direction heading towards ME! I wish I was joking. This occurred some time this past year. \n\nOh, and not to mention those times when I began crossing the street at a damn intersection, but someone still decides to start driving as I'm doing so, anyway. How fun is that? \n\nI just absolutely HATE it when those kind of drivers do all this fucking bullshit! Pisses me the fuck off!\n\nSo, yeah. I just wanted to rant about how those two occurrences are making me hate vehicles more lately. And, I said to myself that I've been wanting to practice more on driving. Yeah, right. I'm not even sure if it's worth continuing to do so, and it's exactly mainly because of all those fucking idiots just like them on the road! Fuck vehicles (yes, I realize my e-scooter counts as a vehicle, as well, but still)! Okay, except busses. They're cool with me, and I've been taking the bus for years, but that's besides the point.",

[a Google search](https://truecommuter.com/what-is-the-average-commuting-bike-speed/) tells me a *beginner* commuting cyclist can do 12km in 45 minutes and 6km in 22.5 minutes. A more experienced cyclist will bring those travel times down to 30 and 15 minutes (and, of course, there are ebikes to consider these days). [Nevertheless, some 73% of commutes in the data set are done in private vehicles](https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Report/TheCongestionQuestionsTechnicalReport.pdf) (10% as passengers, mind).\n\nChoosing to drive these commutes is a choice. And the more people that make this choice, the worse things are. Always remember, \"you're not in traffic, you are traffic\". \n\nIf you're a libertarian, congestion should really drive you up the wall... it's a situation where people refuse to take ownership of their own decisions and as a result inflict congestion, more pollution and dangerous parking behaviours on everyone else. And if you don't think this, you're not a libertarian. Now, if you're not a libertarian I'm sure you're wondering something along the lines of \"but how free is that choice, really?\" and you'd be right to wonder that.\n\nIn many respects, the answer (in Auckland) is \"not much\". Safe cycling infrastructure is mostly not a thing. However, some exists. In fact, there are a fair few Youtube videos showing some of it off (there are some geographic biases in the ones I've found). [This dude's demonstrates some of the pitfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9z-6i3uQ8Y)... shared paths and sections where you're just on an ordinary road. Of course, it's not just about cycling: there's also public transport.\n\nAuckland has a very simple to understand network. If you live in South Auckland proper, you're living close to a rail line. If you live in much of West Auckland, you're not so far from a rail line. If you live in inner East, there's a rail line. If you live on the North Shore, you're reasonably likely to be close to a bus rapid transit system that's largely responsible for creating some major modeshift on the Harbour Bridge (pre-Covid). And then if you live anywhere else, you've basically got bus connections (with sketchy priority) to these \"frequent\" and \"rapid\" links or ferries... lots of ferries.\n\nBefore Covid, this was a very reliable system but it wasn't necessarily fast. According to the timetables, the new electric trains (as in, electrification happened in 2014/15) with a 110km/h top speed, are no faster than 19th Century steam trains. However, a reliable 55 minute or so commute from 30km out isn't so bad. I know because I did it... and a lot of people did it, too: growth was *very* strong. Since Covid reliability has been way down because it turns out that the owner of the tracks doesn't do maintenance. Also, since delta timetables have been cut back and patronage is, I think, at something like 20% of its previous levels (in the halcyon days of Level One it was back to 60-70% of the pre-Covid levels).\n\nIn other words, I strongly believe that for the 75% of people with sub 12km commutes, the vast majority would have functional and reliable public transport options. They'd be slower than cars, but they wouldn't necessarily be egregiously so. And, sure, Western Line trains go no distance at all from the CBD compared to the Southern line (as the crow flies, the former's stations are almost all within 12km, the latter can be as much as 30km out) but an hour's commute is not so bad. My point being here is that \"slower\" doesn't necessarily mean \"too long\". There would need to be *some* adjustment of expectations *but that's not a bad thing.*\n\nOf course, it's not just about active modes and public transport either. People can make choices about how they're living. And I don't mean \"why don't you just live closer to your work?\". I mean, \"why do you own that vehicle specifically?\".\n\nAbsolutely no-one needs a double cab ute. Not a single soul. If you actually need a ute, you're not really travelling in circumstances where you've got passengers. If you are, you probably should have a van instead. Or, possibly, a station wagon.\n\nIt is true that car manufacturers have made a concerted effort to upsize vehicles. It is also true that they advertise in wildly misleading fashions (i.e. empty roads). However, if you're buying a vehicle, you can just choose to buy something else. You absolutely should be criticised for buying a vehicle that's bigger than your needs. You absolutely should be criticised for buying more vehicles than you need. No-one has taken away all the other (much cheaper, more fuel efficient, safer) kinds of vehicles: they are still on car lots waiting to be bought.\n\nNow, a common turn on r/auckland (and maybe here but I can't say with confidence I've seen such claims) is to protest that modern housing developments don't have enough parking spaces. On one hand, this is just a defence of parking minimums. You know, probably the most despised urban planning rule after single family dwelling prescriptions (R1 zoning)... though, none of the top 150 posts on this sub are directly about this (as far as I can tell, [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/smmv3j/just_imagine_all_the_space_that_could_have_been/) was the first I could find but there are lots of comments on the general theme of \"cars take up too much space\"). On the other hand, this is being used specifically as a defence of stuff like in a recent[xpost from](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ts20k9/i_dont_have_words_for_this/) r/mildlyinfuriating, i.e. the privatisation of public space.\n\nIt is not remotely unreasonable to point out that if you can't afford to buy enough land to park your family's seven cars, you shouldn't own seven cars. This is a lifestyle *choice* people are choosing to make that is both derived from and exacerbating the poor design choices of carbrained cities like Auckland. It's probably also relatively easy to fix... I'm sure you've heard that in Japan, you can't buy a car unless you can prove you have private land to park it on (whether you own that space or lease it). I think this is why r/neoliberal is/was so anti-car... the whole system of the carbrained city is only able to exist because of mass subsidisation by the state, which is inefficient.\n\nSo, to sum up... I guess what I'm saying is:\n\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean your trips are actually too far to cycle\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean every possible cycling trip is unsafe\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean using public transport is excessively time consuming\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you *had* to buy a tank sized vehicle\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you need more cars than household members\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you should use public roads to store your cars\n\nAnd most importantly\n\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you have to defend carbrain!\n\nThere are lots of other choices that people make because of carbrain that if they just chose to do something else would make cars so much less problematic. If you can't come to r/fuckcars to criticise these choices (without having to qualify that you know some of them aren't wholly free choices), what is even the point of this sub?\n\nCarbrained cities are created and perpetuated because people like [Phil Goff (Auckland's mayor) use carbrained arguments](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/qmj23m/transport_agency_proposes_reducing_car_parking/). It is not enough to just recognise carbrained design, you also have to recognise the rhetoric that is used to defend and constitute it.",

      "title": "\"When cars won against pedestrians\" \"In the United States it happened more or less a century ago, thanks to a new word that turned the situation around\"; [in depth article in italian, translated with DeepL]",
      "text": "[https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/12/jaywalking-auto-pedoni/](https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/12/jaywalking-auto-pedoni/)\n\nThe article tells also about the origin of the word \"jaywalking\" and how it was used by the car industry to shift the responsibility against pedestrians. In the final part talks about what happened in Italy.\n\nA century ago, in the early twenties, cars were a novelty. In Italy, where they circulated in the tens of thousands, they were almost a rarity. But even in the United States, where they had begun to spread much earlier and had done so much more quickly, they arrived quite suddenly and spread and imposed themselves on roads that until a few years before were traveled by pedestrians, horses, wagons or carriages. So much so that in the early twenties in the United States, they caused serious problems and thousands of deaths per year. Especially among pedestrians, especially children, accustomed to move freely in the street, in contexts where cars did not exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a time, about a century ago, when in the United States the protests against cars and their intrusion into the streets that until then belonged to others were many and intense. But the automotive industry reacted and managed - in a very short time and with great effectiveness - to turn the situation around. The idea that roads should be cars and that pedestrians should be considered guilty if they were hit became common sense. It all had a lot to do with an aggressive and highly effective campaign tied to a simple word: jaywalking, still used in the United States today to define the act of recklessly crossing the street where it's not allowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main research on how and when the concept of jaywalking was introduced, and how relevant it was in reversing an increasingly negative perception of cars, has been done by the American Peter D. Norton, historian and author of the book Fighting Traffic. Interviewed a few years ago by Vox, Norton said, \"In the early days of automobiles, it was up to drivers to avoid pedestrians, not the other way around,\" and speaking with Bloomberg he added, \"If we ask today whose roads are whose, we hear the answer that they are cars, it's just the opposite of what we would have been told a hundred years ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New York City street in the 1920s (Keystone/Getty Images)   \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili19.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili19.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Crosswalks,\" albeit without parallel white stripes, are about as old as pedestrians, and have been around since well before cars. They're one of those things of which it can be said that, albeit in their own way, \"they were already there in Pompeii.\" Certainly, however, in the United States in the early 1900s, the streets belonged to pedestrians more than anyone else. Horses were anything but a novelty, rail vehicles were predictable in their progress, and cars were rare, expensive, noisy, and rather slow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings changed when Henry Ford's Model T, a car designed to be mass-produced and capable of reaching a top speed of about 70 kilometers per hour, became popular. In the years after the First World War and even more so in the first half of the \"roaring\" Twenties, more and more Americans found themselves behind the wheel of heavy and fast cars, without the roads, the rules and what today we would call \"other road users\" having had time and opportunity to adapt to this bursting novelty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New York street in 1923 (AP Photo)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP2301010217-2048x1414.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP2301010217-2048x1414.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1924 the Ford Motor Company's dealers were about ten thousand, and in that period - in which the United States had more or less 115 million people living - the country exceeded the significant threshold of one car for every 10 inhabitants. Motels (short for \"motor-hotel\"), drive-ins and a host of other car-related activities and pastimes were born. But there were also intense protests from those who, more than anything else, found themselves subjected to cars. Especially in urban areas, in fact, cars became one of the main causes of death: in the twenties, only in the United States, they caused the death of about 200 thousand people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCars were therefore seen as a serious threat. Cartoons and comics depicted drivers as \"Death\", complete with scythe. There were those who spoke of a \"terrible massacre that must be stopped\", and there were those who lobbied for cars to be fitted with speed limiters, a bit like what happens today with electric scooters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn November 1924, a full-page headline in the New York Times spoke of the United States as a country \"in revolt against motor homicide.\"  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JW2.jpeg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JW2.jpeg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe article began thus:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The horrors of war turn out to be less terrifying than those of peace. Cars stand out as far more lethal mechanisms than machine guns. The reckless driver claims more lives than the gunner. Those in the streets are less safe than those in the trenches. Fifteen thousand of our men were killed in the nineteen months of our participation in the World War. Two thousand deaths a month, a modest number when compared with the staggering toll of seven thousand lives ended each month by accidents in the United States. The automobile is the largest single cause of death.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it contained this simple chart:\n\n(New York Times)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyt-copia.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nyt-copia.jpg)\n\nAs recalled in a recent article written by Clive Thompson on Medium, in 1922 in New York City a demonstration for road safety was organized: among others, about 10,000 children had marched and 1,054 of them were made to walk apart, to represent the deaths caused the previous year by cars in New York.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThompson also cites a figure that in 1924, there were 12 percent fewer cars sold in the United States than the previous year. The automotive industry realized that the situation was serious and threatened to become very serious. First of all, it tried to promote courses and awareness campaigns for young people, for example by going to schools to remind them to pay attention to traffic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbove all, however, the automotive industry began to talk about jay walking. The word, now in common use in U.S. English, combined the word \"walking\" with \"jay\", a term used at the beginning of the 20th century to denote, in a derogatory manner, someone not very bright from the countryside, a \"yokel\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not clear how and when the word was born - on whose origin there are also a couple of other theories with much less supporters - but it seems that at the beginning it was used, apart from car-related contexts, to talk about someone who came from outside to the city, wandering awkwardly and without knowing what to do or where to go. Thanks to an intense campaign, in which newspapers filled with car advertisements played a relevant role, the word began to be used to refer to pedestrians who crossed the street carelessly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, those who drove - and could afford a car - were the future and were in the right. Those who remained pedestrians, and couldn't even figure out when and how to let cars pass, were the past, were cut off. Rather than a campaign of empowerment, it was in some ways a very effective victim blaming effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(National SafetyCouncil)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jw4.png](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jw4.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were those who tried to react, among other things trying to talk about jay driving, but jay walking had much better luck, moreover becoming a single word: jaywalking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this regard, Norton describes an event organized in the twenties in New York in which a clown who does not know how to cross a street is repeatedly hit, at very low speed, by a Model T, for which - watching the scene - you end up obviously taking sides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second half of the Twenties, car sales started to rise again: road deaths and massacres in the United States were less and less talked about, with different tones and less frequency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew York City in 1933 (Jack Maytig/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)  \n[https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili13.jpg](https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/automobili13.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, there were only one car per 500 inhabitants in Italy: very few, even compared to countries like France, Germany and the United Kingdom. There was one car for every ten inhabitants only in 1965, forty years later than in the United States. What Model Ts had done there, FIAT's 600s and 500s did here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatteo Dondè - an architect and urban planner who is an expert in issues concerning bicycle mobility and traffic calming - explains that, in effect, what happened in the United States after World War I, happened in Italy after World War II. But in a different way, because the period and the context were different. According to him, for Italy, \"the theme of squares was representative, public places par excellence that, from one moment to the next, became spaces to be dedicated to cars\". It happened in Piazza Duomo in Milan, Piazza del Campo in Siena and even in Rome around the Colosseum, \"without even the car manufacturers having to commit themselves as they had done in America\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, continues Dondè, everything happened almost naturally, because - even without the active influence of the \"communicating force\" of the powerful and influential car manufacturers - in Italy \"the country of small towns, the car was even more of an element of freedom than elsewhere\". A certain victimization of pedestrians was therefore a consequence of the spread of cars, rather than something planned from above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere isn't, in Italian, a single word to translate the concept of jaywalking, but according to Dondè the thought at the base of the concept is well present. For example, it can be found in the meaning of the word \"accident\", or in the perception of many road deaths as a \"fatality\", or even in expressions such as \"overturning car\", \"hit-and-run driver\". Or again, in the references, even recent and institutional ones, to pedestrians as subjects that \"must be educated\" and that, in any case, must remain subordinate to cars.  \n[https://twitter.com/Nigel\\_\\_DSouza/status/1482685066132160512](https://twitter.com/Nigel__DSouza/status/1482685066132160512)\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)\n\nI hope that it was an interesting read for you and that you learned many new things about roads and cars.

      "text": "Speedometers on nearly all cars exceed what they are capable of.   \nAutomakers do this to psychologically imply that their vehicles have performance. Most cars are likely to never reach their country's maximum speed limit. Even if they can go so far past these legal traffic limits, drivers will either be violating traffic laws or legally racing. It's just a cosmetic that is less functional.\n\n[Toyota Camry Hybrid](https://preview.redd.it/k2k8wl19gux81.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d03230d3048db88024032d839e3e98e30ee1c3c)\n\nI thought to write this up as I was gonna rant about a car attempting to dominate me today. I was going 30km/h (quite strenuous) up a hill towards a dead end 100 metres ahead with a turn coming up 70m and some driver was busting to overtake me. I was holding my lane by riding in the middle because they most likely wanted to overtake then turn across in front of me even when their turn was so close. I hardly hold up traffic for more than 20 seconds because I know the area but these drivers have no patience. I could see their headlights swerving and hear their engine exerting sporadically for acceleration. I feel lucky that they stayed behind me and didn't hit me. \n\nI think speedometers with these high speeds are likely to incentivise speeding and risky behaviour. Traffic speed limits look quite miniscule on speedometers especially when they are behind a cyclist in which I was today. Speedometers with these hard to see increments seem to allow manufacturers to cover up speedometer inaccuracies. \n\nSpeedometers of cars that aren't recommended for race tracks should have maximum speeds that are slightly faster than the average maximum speed limits globally. Drivers will see their speedometer with greater visual accuracy and more needle action so they can easily avoid a speeding ticket. \n\nI do like how most modern cars now have a large digital readout of speed. In my encounters I often found that most modern cars had more responsible drivers than older cars.",

The thinking will be \"Well if it's electric that means it's green and I can keep my commute the same whilst helping the environment.\".\n\nThis isn't to put the blame on individuals, it just frustrates me the message that is being sent with this reporting. I'm not sure what it's like in other countries, though given Australia has a pretty big car culture as America does I'd imagine the reporting is similar in the US (let me know if so).",

Many people argue its due to needing extra space in a car, which I think is absolute rubbish not one person needs a boot (trunk) with more capacity than a freight ship its a terrible excuse as you practivally move a whole house with an SUV boot, SUVs are the most inefficient vehicles on the road with a little 2.5 litre engine trying to pull a monster 2 ton vehicles, just to get an average of 20mpg whilst emissions may be low the waste in fuel (electric or petrol) its astronomically high. Put the same engine in a smaller car and you will see the engine get 40+mpg The only use I can think for SUVs is if you live on a farm but even then you don't want an SUV you want an offroad vehicle. \n\nAnother major issue with these vehicles is that many people do not know how to drive such a goliath vehicle and they are most definitely the most dangerous and erratic drivers on the road as they believe that because they have a big car they own the road, which simply is not true and makes a safe drive feel a lot more dangerous. I definitely think there should be separate licences for driving a bigger car because some people driving these giant vehicles are a danger to the roads.",

      "title": "Cars and Light Pollution?",
      "text": "One of the most under reported forms of pollution has to be light pollution due to several factors. In a vacuum, how is artificial light a problem to humans? Artificial lights don't directly poison the air, gives us comfort and sense of security at night, and help us to see where we're going. What light pollution?\n\nWell, light pollution *does* negatively affect the natural world as bright lights can make prey visible at night, mess up an animals natural nighttime navigation, can confuse birds, etc. Light pollutions can negatively impact humans as well as it may make it harder to sleep at night if they're a bright light that can cause other factors. I won't go into too much detail here as I'm not the most informed on this subject but feel free to read the articles down below.\n\n[https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/causes/](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/causes/)\n\n[https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/human-health/](https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/human-health/)\n\n[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13157](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13157)\n\nRather, what I would like to share with you is what *I* believe to be the largest contributor both directly and indirectly to light pollution. And that is, of course, cars!\n\nThink about it! Starting with streetlights, why are they so large and bright? Is it for human navigation and security at nighttime? Well, prior to cars, initial kerosene lamps were rather dim, but they were more than sufficient for human navigation at night.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yyp49qa7lqd1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb47639afb7bbb303ef9d4398bd75d7b7452eb99\n\nAs for why modern electric street lamps are so bright? I don't think it's because it was to deter crime, as the concept of \"Eyes on the Street\" would be better than that as in pedestrianized areas, the lights can be rather dim and are nowhere near as bright as the ones for cars.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vti3o4b97lqd1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7d1dee6762dd17c0e5c20f5da0ac4c830c5dd0a\n\nRather, I firmly believe that the widespread adoption of cars lead to street lamps needing to be brighter to allow for \"safer\" driving at night. And hence, creating an endless cycle of brighter and brighter lights.\n\nNow, while streetlights are prominent in cities and urban areas, many roads, in fact most roads don't have streetlights, meaning that cars have to rely on their *own* headlights to see at night. And I shouldn't have to tell you [how bright modern cars' headlights are](https://globalnews.ca/news/10417509/car-headlight-brightness/) and the various problems that causes. You could say that modern streetlights and headlights are [Blinding Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRXx6U8ABQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4iv8jj0elqd1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b1d7db310d240a06752faadfa98be7b1b6604a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw75gmpzbmqd1.jpg?width=2176&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9316c7ce713352e43c4731ccda6505bc7b3db62c\n\nWith that being said, let me compare what *I* have observed between the headlights of cars, versus those of trains. These are just my personal experiences, but feel free to share your own.\n\nNow, the main metro system that I use nearly everyday and is the most familiar with is the Vancouver SkyTrain in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nWith the newer Mark III Rolling Stock, they feature fancy and new LED headlights. From the outside, they can be spotted rather easily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2e9dsjeflqd1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4da66f82957fd4f9e3a8ea626cecc5f26d11fe5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o9mmtyeflqd1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424f98f8c19a00fac3e62b67953c54e579217f41\n\nBut rest assure, because the SkyTrain is a fully automatic system with no driver onboard, when under automatic operations, when you look out of windshield during nighttime, you can't see sh\\*t.\n\nLike for real, you can barely see the track in front of you while riding a Mark III at night. The older Mark I's and Mark II's have brighter, yellow headlights.\n\nBecause the SkyTrain is fully automatic, there's no need for bright streetlights and headlights, and especially with the Mark III's, during normal automatic operations, only the \"daytime running lights\" are on (the Mark III's have real, regular headlights above the daytime running lights), meaning that most of the route is in the dark.\n\nEven on freight trains that *do* require more visual signaling, their headlights don't seem to be as blinding as a modern car, and there's no need for light poles along the route. And of course with in-cab signaling, there's no need for visual signaling lights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01sfumjwolqd1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1104d62c4438cf7943b941c3cd9c7f82c0f832\n\nAs such, I firmly believe that trains in general, both regular freight trains and fully automatic metro systems produce rather little light pollution compared to road vehicles. And that most of our modern light pollution can somewhat be correlated to cars as while cars aren't the only cause, I *do* believe they're one of the biggest.",

      "text": "I believe the current system only pays for expenses related to the death (Funeral and the like). You can sue for lost wages, but that's only valid if the other driver was found to be negligent, which is rarely found to be the case. \n\nSo when your family member is killed by a car, there is no accounting for the negative externality that is not having that person in your life anymore. I think insurance should have to pay out for lifetime lost wages using a similar calculation that the 9/11 victims used. They averaged about $2 million, which seems like reasonable compensation to the families that lost a loved one.\n\nThis would help more accurately account for the cost we pay to keep our car dependent system. It would also dramatically change insurance rates for large vehicles that are more likely to kill people, like the electric hummer. Right now that risk you impose on others is free to you.",

      "title": "Causes of America's Car Culture and Urban Sprawl - and Its Undoing",
      "text": "This post will attempt to create a comprehensive list of why America's built environment and transportation system is the way it is. I will also explain why some of these things are undoing themselves.\n\n1. Frontier Culture combined with cheap and abundant habitable land - From the beginning of US history there was a desire to move west and find land to settle. One of America's grievances in the revolutionary war was not being able to settle past a certain line the British drew. Once we became independent we had the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican American war and the acquisition of the Pacific northwest. The Transcontinental railroad itself was a vehicle to encourage westward settlement. Pretty much every advance in transportation - the Steamboat, steam railways, the horse drawn streetcar, the electric streetcar, the interurban railway, elevated railways, subways and or course cars all had the effect of encouraging decentralization.  Very few American cities are built around walking, horses and buggies, and water transport the way European Cities were. Asian Countries have had extremely large populations combined with smaller amounts of desirable and habitable land. With recent waves of immigration though populations have tended to concentrate themselves in certain regions. immigration has caused the population of places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Miami and other places to explode. Plus there is the controversial trend of gentrification. See here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u0p770/most\\_of\\_america\\_lives\\_on\\_a\\_small\\_portion\\_of\\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u0p770/most_of_america_lives_on_a_small_portion_of_its/)\n2. Cheap and abundant energy supplies - Cheaper gas prices and electricity prices help to drive urban sprawl ([https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/whats-driving-remarkable-decline-urban-sprawl-in-us/](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/whats-driving-remarkable-decline-urban-sprawl-in-us/)). Urban sprawl requires higher electricity consumption and longer electrical lines ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617318280](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617318280)), which results in greater transmission losses. The United States used to have lots of cheap and abundant conventional oil. Oil was cheaper than water in Texas at one point. Today most oil in North America is expensive unconventional oil, thus to meet demand we have to import it or pay much more for it.  Car culture depends upon cheap gasoline or other forms of fuel for cars. Every time there is a substantial increase in oil or gas prices, sprawl goes down. The current (as of the writing of this post) increase in gas prices might go away after a time, but it is part of a longer term trend. Oil discoveries have been declining ([https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oil-natural-gas-discoveries-worldwide-decline-to-lowest-level-in-75-years/](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oil-natural-gas-discoveries-worldwide-decline-to-lowest-level-in-75-years/)). Oil discoveries peaked around the 1960s. The shale boom which made more recent cheaper oil prices possible is coming to an end and was likely never profitable to begin with ([https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/02/oil-frackers-brace-for-end-of-the-u-s-shale-boom-wsj/](https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/02/oil-frackers-brace-for-end-of-the-u-s-shale-boom-wsj/)). Conventional oil peaked around the mid 2000s and hence why we have seen a boom in fracking, tar sands, and offshore drilling, these are only viable with high prices ([https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/conventional-oil-peaked-in-2008-iea-2013-01-18/rep\\_id:4136](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/conventional-oil-peaked-in-2008-iea-2013-01-18/rep_id:4136)). I would recommend looking up James Howard Kunstler, he is controversial and I myself disagree with him that we lack capital for building rail, but he is undeniably correct about the future of oil. Both people who accept climate change and those who deny it assume upon infinite supplies of abundant hydrocarbons, when empirical evidence is contrary to this. Climate change, while definitely a problem, has served to drown out the reality of peak oil. It's not peak oil, gas and coal will also decline too. Any realistic climate change policy needs to include a decrease in the amount of cars, airplanes and trucking for transportation, per capita energy use and consumption. \n3. Cultural bias against cities and towns - American culture and other Anglo saxon outposts have had a cultural bias against cities and town and always idealized country living. Suburbs were seen as a means of combining the two. Car oriented suburbs effectively combine the two, while making both worse in the process. Aside from culture, some cities were beginning to have quality of life issues, such as New York with its tenement buildings. interestingly there is now a roughly even split in the desire for walkability vs more space among the US public ([https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/06/13/pew-survey-liberals-want-walkability-conservatives-want-a-big-lawn/](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/06/13/pew-survey-liberals-want-walkability-conservatives-want-a-big-lawn/)).\n4. Individualism - this should go without saying , but Americans and other Anglo-Saxon countries are hyper-individualist and hate anything that involves contact with other people or sharing with other people. Cars and sprawl embody this to the maximum degree possible and is one reason why people often do not even know their neighbors. \n5. White flight/redlining/urban renewal - I think this point is overemphasized - but white flight and racism, were and to some extent still are factors. Gentrification is reversing this to some extent. To what extent white flight was caused by irrational prejudice towards blacks and to what extent it was caused by legitimate concerns about crime and quality of life (see Detroit riots) is hard to quantify. On the one hand white flight caused urban areas to be gutted, but many cities had riots and people were concerned about their safety. interestingly the policy of \"forced busing\" where the Federal Government attempted to forcibly integrate schools via busing black children to white schools was only done in urban schools, but not suburban ones according \"Crabgrass Frontier\".  There was also public housing and urban renewal that caused urban areas to decline in quality and poverty to be concentrated. Many beautiful buildings were torn down to make way for uglier modern ones (a video on urban renewal: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PydFzWfkdOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PydFzWfkdOw)). I address this here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u8z9d3/my\\_thoughts\\_on\\_white\\_flight\\_suburbia\\_and\\_racism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u8z9d3/my_thoughts_on_white_flight_suburbia_and_racism/)\n6. Ultra high living standards - The period from the 1920s - 1970s, with the exception of the depression and WW2, was basically the most prosperous generation of people in human history and unlikely to be repeated. Resource limits will prevent any nation from ever having that level of wealth, as everyone having American living standards would require several additional planets ([https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/#:\\~:text=Here's%20how%20we%20calculate%20that,if%20everyone%20lived%20like%20Americans](https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/#:~:text=Here's%20how%20we%20calculate%20that,if%20everyone%20lived%20like%20Americans).). In the 1950s we had 35% of workers unionized ([https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22union.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22union.html)), 50% of the world's manufacturing vs today where it is being outsourced ([https://60dayusa.com/posts/what-happened-to-the-u-s-manufacturing-industry/](https://60dayusa.com/posts/what-happened-to-the-u-s-manufacturing-industry/)), and real wages peaked in the 1970s ([https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)), coincidentally the time when the oil crisis happened and cars were least fuel efficient. Single family home ownership and sprawl correlates with incomes too, and unionized workers are more likely to own homes \"In 2006, about two-thirds of American families own their dwellings, a proportion which rises to three-fourths of AFLCIO union members\".  Car ownership corresponds with higher incomes ([https://www.sightline.org/2011/11/28/more-money-more-cars/](https://www.sightline.org/2011/11/28/more-money-more-cars/)) ([https://voxeu.org/article/new-measure-global-middle-class](https://voxeu.org/article/new-measure-global-middle-class)), and several have pointed to low Indian car ownership, but this is in a part a result of their low standards of living. Unfortunately the trend is towards lower incomes and people are struggling. Roughly 50 percent of Americans make 30,000 or less ([https://www.business2community.com/us-news/half-of-americans-make-less-than-30000-per-year-01369249](https://www.business2community.com/us-news/half-of-americans-make-less-than-30000-per-year-01369249)).",

      "text": "I was initially going to parody the post by someone with a post of the same name, but then I decided to actually be constructive and propose some reasonable, non-preachy answers to the guy\u0019s excuses.\n\nTo preface though, any actions one takes alone will mean nothing without collective action, especially with those outside this subreddit and are at best lukewarm to a future not dominated by cars. \n\n\"My emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d\n\nThis is true, but that doesn\u0019t reduce our personal responsibility. This mindset is a killer of positive change in many areas, voting and littering as examples. We can\u0019t stop the bad individually, but we can reduce the harm.\n\nMake sure to stay involved in all levels of government though. If there\u0019s something local to you pumping out emissions, chances are they have to deal with some level of your local government, and you can influence that too, especially if you\u0019re part of a group.\n\n\"I can't afford an electric car.\"\n\nHave you looked into federal subsidies? They can help bring the price down as a customer.\n\nThere are other options though. Hybrids are a decent middle ground, plenty of used ones out there at this point. Try to use the battery as often as you can. \n\n\"I don't have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\"\n\nHave you sat down and tried to plot out a public transit or bike route to/from work? It could be better than you think.\n\nIf public transit is prohibitive due to infrequent appearances or prohibitive travel times, try car pooling with co-workers. It\u0019s still a car on the road, but in total it\u0019s at least one less car that needs to go to/from your work place.\n\n\"Driving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\"\n\nHow significant is the time? If it\u0019s less than 15 more minutes each way, is it really that much better? \n\nIf it\u0019s an hour\u0019s difference or you need to get to another job soon after, then that\u0019s a pass.\n\n\"There's no infrastructure to bike where I live.\"\n\nThat can\u0019t be helped in the moment. High speed roads are especially dangerous to bikers even without assholes gunning for you and you shouldn\u0019t risk your life daily for an intangible future.\n\nTry to find likeminded folk though and pressure whatever local governments to address this need for the community.\n\n\"My workplace is out of reach of biking\ndistance.\"\n\nAforementioned carpooling and plotting public transit routes. \n\nSee if it\u0019s possible to bring a bike with you on public transit to fill in gaps on your trips/make it so you don\u0019t have to bike the whole way.\n\nYou can also try asking to work from home, if it\u0019s an option at your workplace and role.\n\n\"I'm too weak to bike.\"\n\nIf you can\u0019t bike for whatever health reasons, then what you need to do to survive is not your fault. Causing yourself to suffer daily for an intangible goal is only going to worsen both your physical and mental health.\n\nAgain though, look into carpooling. A car off the road for whatever reason is a car not creating emissions or at risk of causing an accident\n\n\"I can't carry my groceries on a bike.\"\n\nThere are carriages that can be purchased and towed by a bicycle.\n\nAlternatively, try to line up multiple errands to be done at once and purchase non-perishable items in bulk to reduce your overall number of car trips. Making a list of what you need/are running low on can really help with this.\n\n\"I can't ride a bike in the cold.\"\n\nTry layering up, but don\u0019t kill yourself trying to make it work. There\u0019s a reason there are days we\u0019re told we shouldn\u0019t drive in X weather conditions, and bikes are more susceptible to the whims of the weather.\n\n\"Not everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\"\n\nIt doesn\u0019t have to be a traditional bike. There are other electric or man powered personal vehicles with additional wheels for stabilization.\n\n\"I don't like waiting for the bus.\"\n\nSee the aforementioned carpooling and plotting of a route. \n\nAlso, there are ways to keep ourselves entertained alone now.\n\nAgain, if it\u0019s a significant burden on your time due to public transit being poor, then do what you have to do. Just be sure to take action where you can to rectify it rather than wallow in the misfortune.\n\n\"I don't like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d\n\nAnother fair reason. Germaphobia, claustrophobia, or just a general unease or fear of strangers is a reasonable reason not to take public transit. Do be sure to investigate all your other options before resigning yourself to a personal car though.\n\n\"How can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\"\n\nSee the aforementioned question on the grocery store.\n\n\n\nWe all here know the climate of Earth is changing fast in ways that are unfavorable to life as it currently exists. Radical action needs to be taken to avert the worst effects. Significant changes need to be forced from the top, and society\u0019s not going to go cold turkey on cars tomorrow, but there are a lot of small things that can be done to address the issue, especially when we take action collectively. \n\nWe\u0019re only going to get other people to work with us if we listen and genuinely address their concerns, rather than dismissing them as excuses. We\u0019re not personal trainers, they aren\u0019t coming to us for help; we\u0019re coming to them and so we need to speak on their terms.\n\nEdited to remove a name.",

We own a pool cleaning business  and work together so unless we change careers we will always have a vehicle for work. \n\nThis year I got an electric bike and have been  absolutely loving it. With that addition to our transportation lineup I was able to convince my wife to (temporarily) go down to only one vehicle. We sold our car last month to take advantage of the used car market that is supposed to slow down this winter with the idea in mind that we will save up money and buy a new car before summer. I have been half messing with and half serious telling my wife that instead of buying a 2nd vehicle, we will sell our current extended cab Nissan frontier for either a SUV that can tow a trailer for work or a similar sized 4 door truck. She always just rolls her eyes and says that we need 2 vehicles for this or that. I am going to use this winter to show her that we can manage with one vehicle and a little extra planning/communication to make sure we don't overlap on times we need the truck. I also plan on getting trailers for my bike to allow me to go get groceries/carry things to big for a backpack when needed. Hopefully a bike for my wife is in the near future too. \n\nIs there anyone that went through a similar transition and can give some pointers/insight on how you managed your schedule to make one vehicle work?

In most instances, the \"choice\" of using a car is no choice at all. Ecologically efficient and less costly electric-car mass transportation has beendeliberately destroyed since the 1930s in campaigns waged across the country by the automotive, oil, and tire industries.

There\u0019s a lot of talk about infrastructure change but what about smaller personal and achievable changes that people can make? Here\u0019s some that I practice:\n\n1. Live within walking distance of a supermarket, no shops and I won\u0019t live there.\n\n2. Live within walking distance of work. I get a job and I look for houses either within walking distance or on a direct bus route. It\u0019s not always easy but, if it comes down to it, I\u0019ll reject the job.\n\n3. Buy or rent  somewhere that has a direct bus or train service to the city centre. That way you can link to the national train system and get pretty much anywhere.\n\n4. Don\u0019t buy  or help to buy your kids driving lessons or a car no matter what they say. The cost involved must be their choice. I didn\u0019t and none of mine have chosen to drive.\n\n5. If you choose to live in the country away from facilities then learn to disassociate from them, grow your own food, join others and use one vehicle to drive into town to shop for all, work from home.\n\n6. Walk wherever you can. Walking is great. It\u0019s a great achievement to spend all day walking to another town, having a bite to eat and walking back again.\n\nI know that our leaders have sold our cities to the automobile industry and some of this seems unachievable for many but it should be what we work towards. Not just swapping the petrol car for an electric one but dumping the thing that enslaves you altogether.",

      "text": "Flemish municipalities will soon be allowed to install fixed speed cameras and trajectory speed controls on bicycle streets. This was decided by the Flemish regional government, Het Nieuwsblad reported on Monday.\n\nThe speed limit in cycling zones or 'bicycle streets' is 30 kilometres per hour, and cars, mopeds or high-speed e-bikes are not allowed to overtake cyclists. In reality, however, this speed limit often seems to be a dead letter, as speeding in a cycling zone can only be detected by police officers on the spot.\n\nThis is why it will soon be possible to use unmanned speed cameras or trajectory speed controls (which measure the average speed of a vehicle over a certain distance, ed.). \"With this adaptation of the rules, we are giving municipalities and police zones more and better possibilities to enforce the speed limit in cycling zones efficiently,\" says Flemish Mobility minister Lydia Peeters.\n\nGrowing popularity\nPeeters announced in April that she wants to see more than 30 per cent of journeys in the region made by bicycle by 2040. In Belgium as a whole, cycling has become increasingly popular in recent years, according to figures from the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility (FPS Mobility).\n\nAccording to the FPS Mobility, at the beginning of 2023, cycling was the main mode of transport for 14.1 per cent of Belgian commuters, compared to 7.8 per cent in 2005 and 11.1 per cent in 2017. No other mode of transport in Flanders, Wallonia or Brussels has grown more strongly over the years. The rise of electric bikes and speed pedelecs is partly responsible for this growing popularity.\n\nAlong with the steep rise in popularity of cycling, the death toll among cyclists reached an all-time high in 2022.",

So it seems like you like that used compact hatchback there! That's not a bad choice if you are a beginner or some old man! You know right? This is the thing you drive as a starter until you are ready for the real thing! You know to be honest this car sucks! It's only a 1.4 liter engine and well, I just drank that amount of Pepsi this morning. Don't be a wussy, how could you overtake with this weak engine? It's dangerous to be with this thing at all times. Don't listen to others about body weight/horsepowers nonsense, it's still just a 1.4 what can't accelerate properly. \n   \nSo can we get to the real deal now? Well, we have trucks and trucks and trucks and moooore trucks! That's plenty you can choose from. Please ignore that room with the other compacts and full size sedans and combis because our SUVs and Trucks has just the same driver assistant systems installed! And how else could be the king on the roads if you don't have the largest vehicle under you? What the family would call you if you were about to stuff them into a VW Golf? After five miles they will beg you to let them free because 4 people barely got any space!  \n  \nImagine being on a date and you arrive to your girlfriend's house with this crap! You can honk as many as you want she will not see you from her windows it's so small. She would probably think that it's just some maniac being horn...playing with the horns. But if you want to be single forever you can still choose that car! We entering into grownups territory with this huge, factory lifted 6 seater truck! See how comfy is it? The cabin section only is as long as that lame compact, how can it be not comfortable? You can see every peasant from above! Let me ask you something! Are you into boating? So no. Because you look like about 10-15 years away from midlife crisis so soon you will be! This car will tow not one, not two but three boats at the same time! And even if you are an old geezer who can't drive don't worry! We have an autopilot system which recognizes pedestrians as trashcans just how you will do after you get this truck!  \n  \nWhat will you use your car for? Umm so getting to work, doing groceries and visiting friends? Well, this truck is ideal for that! To be honest any car could do that but what if.. what if.. What if your friends are moving and you need to help them moving furnitures? They will be struggling with the furniture moving services or a rental truck that costs a lot! You hate your friends or why don't you want to help them? What if some emergency happens to your family? Imagine your grandma moving to an ultra-rural places with dirt roads only. How would you visit her without a truck suitable for off-roads? What if they fire you and you only can find a job in a construction site? You need to transfer machinery to the site, right? So many cases could happen when you need a truck and if you don't have you lose friends, family, jobs, etc.  \n  \nTalking about engine options we got the sucker 2.0, the also sucker 3.0 6 cylinders and the AWESOME 5.8 LITERS V8 ENGINE WITH ENOUGHT POWER TO TOW THE ENTIRE LAKE! WHY WOULD YOU TRANSPORT YOUR BOATS WHEN YOU CAN TRANSPORT THE ENTIRE LAKE TO YOUR HOUSE? IT SKYROKETS WHEN THE LIGHTS SWITCH TO GREEN LEAVING (old) SUPERCARS IN THE DUST! IT'S OUR BEST SELLING PRODUCT so probably you will be left in dust at the green too. Also an electric version is incoming. I can subscribe you to a list so you can get your electric truck when it arrives to the store making african sla..proudly working kids in the lithium mines proud.  \n  \nSo.. you still want that 1.4 compact? Did you even listen to me? Your life sucks and it will suck more if you don't buy a REAL VEHICLE LIKE A MAN! You will die in 7 days if you don't buy the truck! Send a message to 5 of your friends about how trucks are awesome if you don't want your parents dead!  \n  \n-so yeah this was obviously a satire about how the unneccessarily huge cars get sold not by car salesmen but by families and friends making a huge demand for such cars.",

Here is Jeff himself driving one of these E rickshaws : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2onRQXgojo\n\nAs an Indian living in India, the 'need' for car doesnt really make sense. Within 1 km (0.6 mi) of my house, I have literally  hundreds of shops - grocery / barber / restaurants / cycle repair / doctor's clinic / cafe / milk booth / even imported swiss chocolates.\n\nSince the last 2 years, online delivery of groceries have really ramped up. These delivery boys (of amazon or local company) use escooters or erickshaws to deliver everything.\n\nUber / Ola is cheaper than owning a car (insurance / maintaince / fuel). I hire a rickshaw anyway through these apps.\n\nTrain network is well developed, more electrified than EU / US, and bullet train network is under construction. Local Metro trains are currently operational in 15 cities : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oToAoQvi4Ns\n\nErickshaws are a game changer. These are 2000 USD / 25kmph 3 wheelers which usually carry 4-6 passengers / cargo in dense neighbourhoods. There are more than 5 million of these All India : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqVIjKNdjC8\n\nThis has created well paying jobs for atleast 5 million families along with robust Indian manufacturing for these. Also reducing the need for millions of personal scooters (usually petrol).\n\nAn Indian startup Ola (now a 10B USD+ company) has created world's largest 2 wheeler Electric Scooter plant, taking bookings online : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKhkE0AuJ0\n\nMajor cities are getting electric buses : https://www.electrive.com/2022/03/08/olectra-delivers-150-electric-buses-to-pune/\n\nCars are a huge waste of metal / batteries / space / energy. For travelling within city, they are much more expensive than Uber / Ola apps or erickshaws. For travelling from one city to another, they are quite slow (compared to trains).\n\nAll electric vehicles need a minimum running everyday to break-even with a petrol vehicle. Delivery guys travel a lot, and EVs help reduce massive pollution and fuel bills.\n\n2022 is another lesson why we should move away from petrol / diesel. No more funding crazy dictators. But the shift should be towards Electric public infra, not electric cars.\n\nFeel free to ask anything stupid haha.",

      "text": "Cars are probably one of the dumbest and most wasteful ways you could try to move billions of people around from A to B every day. The average weight of a car is 1300kg, the average weight of a person is  62kg, which means when a person drives to work, over 95% of the energy, resources, space consumed and pollution goes into moving the car itself. Then when you're at work, the car just sits there most the day, taking up space and resources, not being utilised. It's so wasteful, individual transport is just plain stupid. Cars spew out pollution, changing the climate and filling our air with toxic fumes. We breath in micro-particles contained in the exhaust of cars, particles so small they pass through cell membranes and fuck with us, give us cancer and all sorts of diseases. The toxic fumes of cars stink, the engines are noisy, even the wheels are noisy. Endless piles of tyres build up, because cars are designed to need disposable products like wheels.\n\nCars are what you get when the free market is left to decide how we live, there is no plan with cars, it's just millions of individual consumers and companies all deciding to do what is individually good for them, with no greater plan, no coordination, just the wasteful and ignorant direction of the free market producing the cluster fuck on civilisation that is cars and the roads they require. With cars you are forever remaking billions of individual vehicles as each one lives a mere generation, all the while you're constantly remaking endless stretches of roads which eventually crack and wear under the weight of all those cars and trucks. It's madness on a monumental scale, a scale so vast that it changes the landscape and climate of the entire planet.\n\nSo what could we do differently? Almost anything would be better.  Personally I'm an electrified train and tram guy, I think bikes can fill in the gaps, especially electric bikes. I think that if we took a tiny fraction of what we spend on cars collectively as individuals and governments, then applied this tiny fraction to electrified trains, trams, cycling infrastructure and subsidies on bikes and ebikes, we wouldn't want cars. For those situations where the collective system doesn't work, we could always have a few electrified cabs, but those situations are rare in a transportation system organised correctly. The collective benefits from the efficiency, the fresh air, the quiet, the enormous cost savings and sustainability would all make up for any loses to select individuals. Then there are the car enthusiasts, but they're dumb enough that they'd forget about cars quickly enough, besides, they could always just get fucked and find a hobby that doesn't destroy the planet.\n\nI'm also a big believer in relocalisation, alternative systems of planning that don't rely on the free market to decide where people live, systems that have intelligent planning and would produce communities where people live near where they work and can just ride a bike, walk or catch a tram. We often forget that a big part of the problem is that people often live hours from where they work, this is insanely inefficient for billions to be travelling so far every day, simply because the system responsible for organising where individuals live has no intelligence behind it at all and doesn't optimise anything for anyone.\n\nIf I could live in a world without cars I would, but for now as this is just a dream, I'll take solace in the fact that there are others out there like me that find the whole transportation situation in our modern world one of the biggest, dumbest spectacles that this planet will ever have the misfortune of witnessing.",

Any city &gt;5 million people metro downtown that insist on car reliance as a method of transport are simply looking for a population sustainability issue given how inefficient car is regarding of the use of very precious space (parking, congestion).\n2. Cars use case is mostly rural where the density isn\u0019t justifying the public transport except for the cheapest &amp; most unreliable one possible and the land is on discount.\n3. EV crank it to 11 because rural electricity is by it\u0019s nature is subsidized by city where the density allow cheaper electricity (thanks to economy of scale) which enables said city grid to subsidize the area around the city (the suburbs) but any city that know what they\u0019re doing (Tokyo, Amsterdam, most German city, Paris, London, Singapore) know that suburbs still have to be given a coverage of public transport because eventually people that lived in suburbs works in the metro and if they\u0019re allowed to bring in their cars it will cause the same problem with the car ownership in the downtown regardless of the legality of owning cars in downtown.\n\nWhy cars are oversaturated:\n1. We never have a actual invention of new car technology since Hybrids (EV first prototype was more than century old) which made the technological barrier to this industry relatively small compared to let\u0019s say a chip fab.\n2. Which makes every country down to the low income countries that have a industrial base like China, Russia &amp; India to be able to make their own cars (albeit with varied success in capturing the market share).\n3. Compound that with some country like China, Japan, South Korea implementing textbook fascism and transfer everything (including confiscated bank deposit (in China case)) to the manufacturing of cars to make sure that there\u0019s no mass unemployment regardless of the demand of said cars &amp; the other car producing countries reaction to said textbook fascism move.

      "title": "Any other adult non-drivers here who feel like the world isn't built for you?",
      "text": "Just discovered this sub today. Don't know why the algorithm never recommended it given my history and interests. Can't tell based on the introductory stuff how much of the membership is adult non-drivers, though.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I figured I'd start driving just like everyone else. But when I got behind the wheel for the first time, I was shocked by how it felt. Nothing like I expected. I literally couldn't control the car -- it felt exactly like it ALWAYS wanted to turn left or right and that I could not make it go straight. It looks literally effortless when literally everyone I see drive drives, from real life to movies and tv, but when I had to do it, it felt IMPOSSIBLE. I couldn't and still can't for the life of me understand how anyone does it. No one can explain what they're doing that I'm missing. I get the centipede's dilemma, but this is ridiculous.\n\nDifferent vehicles, different environments, different parent trying to help made no difference in my utter inability to grasp how humans control or direct cars. The first question everyone asks when I reveal this is, Do I have dyslexia? No. Never been diagnosed with anything else, either. I wear glasses because I'm terribly nearsighted, but that's it. No problems with depth perception or balance or dizziness -- I can control a bike and an electric bike just fine, after all -- and it's not even a physical difficulty anyway. I simply can't make a car go straight (or any direction I want), and nobody can tell me why or how they do it. Yes, I've tried again as an adult, and it felt just as impossible as when I was a  teenager. Technically, I'm sure I could keep digging with the help of doctors and find a reason, which could be fixable, but I've chosen not to -- I don't want to risk my and others' lives for something that's not necessary.\n\nSo I've gotten to age 36 in Pittsburgh, PA with no driver's license. I took all road trips by train or bus until I got over my fear of flying during the pandemic. As for local transportation, I began bicycling almost everywhere in college and continue to get around primarily by bike and bus. I got an electric bike 3 years ago, but learned to my surprise and horror that using it affected my ability to ride a regular bike, so it's tragically been sitting the garage for 2 years. I've taken 3 major multi-night bike trips so far (I would do it every year if not for money).\n\nFrom one angle, being a full-time bus rider and bicyclist is 100% doable in my city.  I used my passport for all ID needs until it was about to need renewed. I then used my passport to get a non-driver's state ID, and then used said state ID to renew my passport. I only apply for jobs in places I know I can easily get to by multiple bus or light rail lines, but by coincidence, I've been able to bike to almost every job I've had. I work office jobs (been a legal assistant for the past several years) that don't require a driver's license (so far, only ever applied for 1 promotion 2 employers ago where they rejected me solely for not having a driver's license even though no duties involved driving). I sometimes pick up groceries using my panniers that say \"One Less Car\" but usually use the bus on my way home from work. I can take the cats to the vet on the bus in their carriers. I shamelessly utilize a lot of delivery services like Instacart because in addition to working full time, I'm the primary caregiver for my 100 yr old grandfather, my disabled roommate, and 3 cats and have no guilt about using anything that can help me save time on all the chores and duties I have to fulfill. It's 100% possible to live and function in enough neighborhoods in my city without a car.\n\nBut from another angle, that very fact makes it so frustrating that the world isn't built for people like me. Everywhere you look, the structure reflects how it was designed with the assumption that every visitor or user will have a car. Sure, I can walk up the hills and across dangerous interactions in sprawling shopping plazas, but would it be so hard to construct paths for pedestrians who want to shop? Sure, I have a great pair of waterproof snowboots, but cars get a clear path in winter while I have to stomp through the snow -- is that really fair? We have a few bike lanes, but their locations seem arbitrary, not like they actually make running errands any easier.\n\nI hope it's okay to say the pandemic and Great Resignation have only made things worse. For example, there's a Wendy's literally down the block and right around the corner from our house, but they stopped allowing people inside in March 2020 and are still drive thru only in 2023. This means that the only reason I can't walk down and get food for the same price as other customers is because I don't own a car. I know, first world problems, but if you're going to only serve customers who own a car, at least admit it -- post a sign saying you don't serve people who don't own a car unless they pay twice as much for delivery. If you can't retain enough employees to keep the lobby open, fine, but why can't you allow people to even place an online order and physically walk inside and pick it up? How much more labor can that require? You could put the bags on a shelf where people can walk in and grab it with no employee needing to do anything! How is that more labor than if a Grubhub or Doordash driver for the order went through the drive thru? Nope, if you don't own a car, you're not worthy of being our customer, and you're not welcome here. This was pervasive in 2020, but with no reason for \"nobody allowed inside\" now but lack of employees, it's really frustrating to come across businesses that have decided anybody who doesn't own a car is so far beneath their notice that it's not worth giving them an easy, obvious, common way to pick up an order that doesn't require any more labor than the drive thru does. Not only are non-drivers freaks who don't deserve consideration, they don't exist -- after all, who DOESN'T drive everywhere?\n\nOn occasions where I have to think about it, this \"everyone drives\" mentality and the resulting world built for cars (where I live, anyway) alternates between making me roll my eyes and shake my head and the irrationality and feeling depressed. I live closer to the way the anti-global warming media says I should... and I get punished for it with arbitrary restrictions and unnecessary obstacles! Meanwhile, the people using and relying on what so many now call evil and dirty are rewarded with a system that caters to them. Hell, yeah, fuck cars and the narrowminded urban planners and business owners who were never taught what a bike is!",

      "text": "A day or so ago, the BBC posted a [quiz](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348) about how we as individuals can minimize our CO2 emissions based on a [meta-analysis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/pdf) of 6,992 studies. The study of course, was not about individual choices, saying \"Here we argue that a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches provides a robust base for the review of the mitigation potentials of consumption options.\"\n\nIn question 3 on the BBC, they ask \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" However, the study found that the \"best transport choice\" is neither of these. The study found, \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options\" (their emphasis).\n\nSo, I am typing an email to the BBC's corrections department, to change question 3 to accurately represent the study to say that living car-free is the best transportation option.\n\nIn case they decide to re-word the question to ask \"Which is the better transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" I am also arguing that the study does a poor job of accounting for the real-world factors of Tesla vs. bus, namely:\n\n1. it does not account for CO2 emissions from construction of the vehicle.\n2. it does not ask where the electric car gets its electricity from.\n3. it does not make a traffic analysis; use of mass transit makes fossil-fuel cars less polluting by reducing traffic\n4. it assumes only short urban trips can be replaced with mass transit; the study found that public transit has CO2 emissions as low as 0.00-0.09 kg/km depending on the fuel source, since public transit is sometimes electrified anyway. Looking only at the exhaust pipe (which our study does), mass transit and electric cars are almost identical.\n\n.\n\nI provide my letter below and invite everyone to restate it in your own words asking that Question #3 be corrected to \"living car-free.\" The part about comparing electric vs mass is optional.\n\n.\n\nTo: [newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk](mailto:newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk) \\[newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk\\]\n\nBBC,\n\nI recently saw your quiz ([https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348)) on how individuals can make personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint. Your quiz was based on [this University of Leeds study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/meta). Question 3 asks \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate?\" The study found that \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options,\"  (emphasis theirs). However, your quiz only lists \"electric car\" and  \"public transport\" as options for \"the best transport choice.\" The  correct answer in your quiz, according to the study, should be \"Living  car-free.\"\n\nBut  even if we wanted to compare electric cars to mass transit and ask the  better choice, there are four important aspects of the study to  consider.\n\n1. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe. Obviously electric is  zero, but mass transit varied between 0.00 kg/km (for electric buses  and trains) to 0.09 kg/km. Compare that to fossil fuel cars, which the  study found to have emissions between 0.6 and 3.6 depending on the  model, and electric and mass transit are almost identical. The study  assumed that mass transit would only replace \"short and urban car  trips,\" meaning the other trips were calculated as being done with a  fossil-fuel car. It's not a fair comparison.\n2. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the electric power plant it charges from. [This study](http://idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/Tesla_Motors.pdf) found that Tesla electric cars still generated 0.0461 kg/km when the grid is based on natural gas.\n3. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the CO2 released from production of the vehicle. [This Politifact article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/11/viral-image/producing-electric-cars-battery-does-not-emit-same/)  notes that just producing one electric car's battery can generate  between 4,500 and 7,500 kg of CO2, depending on the electricity source  of the factory. While buses also emit CO2 just by being built, this  value should be divided by its average ridership, which unfortunately  the Leeds study does not touch on.\n4. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering a traffic analysis. If more people take mass transit, there is less  traffic on the road, meaning the fossil-fuel-burning cars become more  fuel efficient. If they are replaced with electric cars, there is no reduction in traffic.\n\nThe  study is very helpful for a lot of reasons, but question number 3  should not be a comparison between electric cars and mass transit. It  should simply state that the \"best transport choice\" is living car-free,  as the study reports.\n\nBest regards,\n\n***\\[your IRL name\\]***\n\n***\\[your IRL email address\\]***",

      "title": "Another addition to the \u001cableism\u001d arguments in favor of cars",
      "text": "I had originally typed this up as a comment, but I decided to make it a full text post. \n\nIf we build our cities to be more walkable, while keeping accessibility in mind, then people who have difficulty walking will *also* have an easier time getting around. \n\nDo you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to get an electric wheelchair in and out of a vehicle? Have you ever tried to cram a folded manual wheelchair into the trunk of a compact car? Do you know how expensive any form of wheelchair-friendly private transportation is, whether you own that vehicle or not? It sucks! Right now, many disabled people have to rely on cars driving up close to the building. \n\nBut, if more people lived in more walkable places (that were also accessible to mobility devices), then they could get around their own neighborhoods much more freely. Instead of switching between transportation modes multiple times in a simple trip (which is exhausting), they could just use one mode the entire time, just like abled people do when they walk somewhere. I\u0019ve watched disabled family members struggle with getting in and out of the car, trying to park as close as possible, and leaning on a shopping cart the whole time they\u0019re in a big box store. They couldn\u0019t easily go anywhere, so going out was necessities-only. But if they had a walkable neighborhood, well-kept sidewalks with curb cuts, and nearby markets? They could have gone out so much more easily, just by switching to a Rollator or wheelchair. (Well, it\u0019s hilly here, so maybe an electric wheelchair or some other electric-assisted device would be the best option.) \n\nMobility devices can be incredibly expensive. But cars are significantly more expensive, and in a car-dependent place, you don\u0019t have a choice. If I need to use a very expensive electric wheelchair, I have three choices: I could buy just the wheelchair, and either risk my life riding to the grocery store along a highway, or lose a big chunk of independence by needing someone else to drive me around. I could buy just the car, and go through the shitty song and dance described above. Or I could buy both, go through a different shitty song and dance, and also have the debt collectors beating down my door. Because unfortunately, being disabled in America often also means being poor. \n\nAll of this only addresses basic needs, like getting groceries or going to the doctor. Imagine if my disabled family members had actually been able to go to a park, or a library, or a hangout spot whenever they wanted to. They could only do that very rarely. \n\nLastly, there are a lot of people on the borderline of needing mobility aids. I\u0019m one of them! Sometimes I get horrible fatigue episodes where even sitting up unsupported is a struggle. But most of the time, I can walk around just fine. I don\u0019t own a wheelchair, and sometimes I have to rely on my car (or just stay in). My disabled family members are also on that borderline. It\u0019s not a black-and-white thing, where you\u0019re either paralyzed from the waist down or you can run miles every day. Disability is complicated. And when we\u0019re all trapped inside our houses, inside our cars, and leaning on shopping carts, it\u0019s easier to pretend we\u0019re not here. But disabled people have been here for as long as there have been people. Maybe more people using a wheelchair sometimes, and more people being visibly disabled more often, would reduce the stigma around looking disabled. \n\nTl;dr: disabled people only rely on cars in car-dependent places because they have to. Mobility aids become more useful, and neighborhoods become more accessible, when they are not centered around cars. Car-centric towns are more structurally ableist than accessible walkable towns.",

      "text": "There's long been a concept, 'broken windows' whereby once you let certain things slide, a sort of reverse gentrification takes over and that part of a town or city starts dying. \n\nI'd argue that the process more typically begins with planning or accommodating car use, and that this leads to a spiral of community destruction that has a role in the general increase in other types of antisocial behavior and crime. It leads to degeneration of civic and neighbourhood pride, causes children to be herded indoors, the lack of play leads to increased family stress, poorer child socialisation and increases in psychological problems, mental illness, impulse control problems and drug use and other negative behaviours, and health effects like morbid obesity. \n\nNoise is also one of the big factors affecting sleep and healthy development, but also we know of other factors like the historical lead poisoning. \n\nHow clear this is to me is thanks to a chance sequence of events that led to me moving away for some time from my car centric society (suburbs, Britain) to several towns and cities in western Ukraine. \n\nIn my current city, there is literally no need to own or use a car, unless you are miles out of city limits. Trans and trolley buses are extensively used. Urban population density is much higher than suberbs, most apartment blocks are 5 to 9 stories. \n\nThere is almost zero morbid obesity. Children and teenagers exhibit few signs of behavioural problems. There is play areas in every group of apartment buildings. Whilst their are parked cars, few cars are actually moving and there is no through roads in these spaces. Children play outside with a adult nearby from morning to night. There is no gangs, you would not worry that leaving your kids to roam as teenagers will get them drawn into hard drugs or crime, no signs of antisocial behavior except the odd drunk but they typically just mind themselves quietly. \n\nPolice stations are numerous and included in some of these apartment complexes. Shops occupy the first floor on all major streets. \n\nSo it's better than a 15 minute city for most things. \n\nBeing a parent here seems far easier when your kids can play outside your apartment block with other kids. As they grow older there are many safe spaces and parks and completely segregated cycle lanes. This extensive play seems to be vital for the development of children, and since the diet isn't particularly better in terms of junk food, I strongly feel explains the overall highly civil behavior of Ukrainians and the apparently improved behavior and lack of psychological and impulse problems in children and teens, who almost never exhibit threatening or antisocial behaviors. \n\nTraffic congestion and volumes are very light compared to western cities. It's eminently possible to go completely car free and rent a parking spot if you wanted a car at the city boundary. \n\nAnother interesting thing, there are curfews so no travelling outside after 12 midnight. This seems to have no negative impacts except make it quieter. The fact is cars are not needed in cities like this, with the exception of maybe disability vehicles for some users., and perhaps for some families. \n\nAlso, the electric micro scooters every authority seems to hate in the west, are very popular here and easily available for rent. I would estimate that on cycle lanes their use out numbers bike use by at least 2 to 1. Anything that makes cars seem more irrelevant is a good idea. One potential improvement could be a rentable cargo e bike scheme. \n\nEven towards the edges where big shed marts are to be found, these are usually served by tram stops, and an interesting thing that would strike you about these, is how much smaller the space used for parking is at these locations. One plot has a large mall, a car park that is so small that the space you would see taken up in the west for parking (and then some) is instead planned for being used to squeeze in a large multistory apartment block, of 12 or so stories.

      "text": "I'm new in this sub and I genuinely wasn't aware of how car-centric most US cities are.\n\nI live in a european capital city, though in the outskirts. Every weekend I walk 15 minutes to the train station, then ride the train for 25 minutes to meet up with my friends. The train is always full, most people take public transportation to the city because it has so many connections. Once I'm there with my friends we spend the entire day walking around, taking breaks to eat lunch/a snack/dinner somewhere and going into stores. Cars are not really 'allowed' in the capital city and if you need to go by car there are only 4 lanes, and most of the time they are for buses or sometimes taxis to take people to their hotel. If you drive your car to the city and you park for over a certain amount of minutes (can't remember exactly) you get a ticket. And there aren't even that many parking spots anywhere, only near hospitals and such, for obvious reasons.\n\nThere is a lot of greenery everywhere and people can rent bikes and electric scooters to visit the city instead of taking their car. There are also tour buses and small vehicles connected (?) to a bike where people sit and a guide drives them around. The city is old and the buildings are beautiful. \n\nThis is all thanks to plenty of car laws becoming effective years ago (because pollution was getting out of hand) and they started letting only the vehicles with an odd plate number one day and an even number the next day in the city center. Then they forbid the vehicles that came out before a certain year (2006 I think?) from going in. Soon it became difficult and tiring to even drive there and now most people take the train or bus and the 'cloud' of pollution over the city is starting to go away! The levels of pollution in most areas are green \\*which means good air quality\\* and only very few are yellow. I wish this happened to every city. I want it for everyone.\n\n\\*Sorry for bad English!\\*",

Here's a sampling of posts from *the past week* that covers the typical kinds of genres you'll see on there:\n\n* [Dangerously overinflated tires (should be at like 30 psi)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10ayq0u/defused_a_bomb_today/)\n* [People not understanding how their expensive vanity vehicles work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10aipy6/customer_complaint_it_steers_funny/)\n* [People driving with a missing wheel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/109zpfb/just_had_this_come_in_we_work_on_trailers_also/)\n* [Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10b6kjc/rust_belt_strikes_again/)\n* [Customers refusing dire repairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/107jnuv/he_said_the_belt_was_good_because_it_wasnt_making/)\n* [Stupid manufacturing and design](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1073fxz/vws_make_my_head_hurt_water_from_the_sunroof/)\n* [Evidence of bad work by previous mechanics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1063rg6/valvoline_instant_oil_change_drain_plug_removal/)\n* [Bald tires](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10acas2/i_dont_know_anything_about_cars_but_we_my_husband/)\n* [Dangerous electrical](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10av9d9/all_the_electricity_is_leaking_out/)\n* [People are sometimes just dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/10b9xjq/getting_real_tired_of_these/)\n\n\nThe sub is an extremely deep well.\n\nThis is by no means intended to blame the end users. Cars are complex, expensive, and dangerous objects that inflict all kinds of psychological damage on people in car-centric transit infrastructure. We're pushed into debt to buy the newest bright-and-shinys, or can just barely afford a cheap car to begin with, then feel guilty when we can't afford to maintain them properly, a part of car ownership that is allowed to just go by the wayside in the US. To me, /r/Justrolledintotheshop provides reminders of just how normal it is a) to let car maintenance go completely to hell, b) for people's need for transportation to overcome the most insane and personally unsafe conditions, and c) for us to do nothing about it collectively because lost lives are considered an acceptable cost of driving even under optimal conditions, so what's a little more on the side?\n\n/r/Justrolledintotheshop is obviously a sub that likes cars and sees some consistent problems with how people use cars. But the users tend to indicate lack of personal responsibility as the culprit, hence the sub being dedicated to \"absolutely stupid things.\" Because it is true under any system that some portion of the population will act irresponsibly, it is obviously true that some car drivers neglect maintenance out of their own failings. But I think we can agree here that the scale of the problem is evidence of the fact that, *even if it is true* that tons of people are not inherently responsible enough to maintain a car, we shouldn't force everyone to own cars.",

      "title": "Why drive a Tesla when a WWII-era steam train can outdo it in emissions?",
      "text": "***WARNING: MATH AHEAD***\n\nSo recently, I watched an episode of the amazing podcast Well There\u0019s Your Problem, specifically episode 113 discussing battery-electric locomotives [1]. Around the 56 minute mark, host Justin Roczniak remarks that he and Tom Coletti did some \u001cback of the napkin math\u001d to determine the relative environmental impact of transporting passengers on a steam-locomotive powered train versus electric automobiles, and came to a pretty shocking conclusion about the break-even point. After seeing this, I was inspired to do the math myself and see if I could replicate his conclusions, here\u0019s what I found.\n\nWe\u0019ll start with the steam locomotive in question: for my math, I used Union Pacific FEF-3 locomotive number 844. This locomotive was built in 1944, and was frequently employed on passenger trains up until around 1957. Soon afterwards, it became one of the last surviving mainline steam locomotives still in use and was used from then onwards as a PR ambassador for the Union Pacific. This locomotive represents the state-of-the-art for steam locomotive design as it was when the art ended following WWII. \n\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the UP, the 844 has a fuel capacity of 6,200 gallons of No. 5 fuel oil, and one full tank will give the locomotive a range of approx. 300 miles [2]. This means that the engine burns around 21 gallons per mile. According to Climatiq, No. 5 fuel oil emits 10.24 kilograms of CO2e per gallon burned [3]. \n\n21gal per mile * 10.24kg CO2e per gal = 215.04kg of CO2e per mile\n\nTo make the math later on a little easier, I\u0019ll convert 215.04 kilograms to 215,040 grams.\n\nNext, let\u0019s take a look at the emissions from electric vehicles. Remember, although these vehicles do not directly pollute, the electric grid that these vehicles often get their charge from does. For my math, I decided to use the Tesla Model Y, simply for the fact that it is the best selling electric vehicle in the US. According to a study published to Statista, a Model 3 charged off of the US grid will emit 116 grams of CO2e per mile [4]. \n\nNow for the fun part. We\u0019ve established an apples-to-apples comparison for emissions from the 844 and the Model Y, so now we can simply divide and find the quotient:\n\n215040g / 116g H 1853.79\n\nSo it takes about 1854 Teslas to equal one 844 in terms of CO2e per mile. Assuming one person in each of those Teslas, how many passenger cars will the 844 need to pull in order to carry 1854 passengers? Let\u0019s give 844 the best shot possible by having it pull St Louis Car Company Bi-Level Commuter Coaches. These cars have a pretty high capacity of 169 seats per car, and when loaded have a weight of around 79 tons (62 tons for the empty car, plus 17 from the 169 200-pound passengers aboard) [5]. \n\n1854 / 169 H 10.97\n\nSo, with 11 passenger cars behind it, the 844 has broken even and produces less CO2e per mile than a fleet of Teslas. In the podcast, Justin says his math came out to about 10 cars, so we can say that his math is about right. Now for the even more important question, how fast can the 844 go with those 11 cars? Well, at 72 tons per car, this train would weigh 792 tons total. To find speed per train weight, I will refer to a set of charts used by the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 30s-early 40s to calculate tonnage ratings. On page 22, we see a chart for the FEF-1 class locomotives, which are similar enough to the FEF-3s to be comparable. At 792 tons, this train could reach nearly 100 MPH on flat track; just shy of 70 MPH on a 0.5% uphill grade; and just over 50 MPH on a 1% grade [6].\n\nTLDR:\n\nWhen pulling 11 bi-level commuter coaches, a 1944 steam locomotive produces less emissions per mile than if all the passengers in those coaches were to drive individual Teslas. Not only that, but this train could pull those coaches on flat track at a much higher speed than those Teslas could legally drive on our highways today, and at speeds similar to highways even when climbing hills. Keep all of this in mind whenever people try to tell you that electric vehicles are the way out of our current climate crisis. They aren\u0019t. Trains are.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0qcxyyllQ4\n[2]: https://www.up.com/heritage/steam/844/\n[3]: https://www.climatiq.io/data/emission-factor/d0440c0d-4ffc-4838-9079-43df928f54f3\n[4]: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401887/tesla-lifecycle-emissions-model-3-model-y-by-selected-countries-and-regions/#:~:text=While%20the%20emissions%20from%20a,Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.%2C%20respectively.\n[5]: https://www.irm.org/player/cnw1/?roster_type=custom\n[6]: https://utahrails.net/flebbe-papers/UP_Horsepower-Curves-and-Tonnage-Ratings-Charts.pdf\n",

And that, if leafy, could reject more heat.\n\nAlthough a component of long term temperature rise is caused by GHG, and some of that undoubtedly human, a big component of what humanity experiences as extreme heat is due to the additional urban heat island increasing over time from built area and human energy using activities.\n\nEdit, to be more accurate, I should say, that a lot of the long term trend of increased *experienced* extreme heat, is due to cars.",

      "text": "I attempted to post this article in r/Australia though had it deleted with no reason given, so figured I'd preach it to the choir instead :-) \n\nTL:DR at end.\n\nRecently there have been a flood of articles in Australian media with titles like \"Concerns increase in fires linked to lithium-ion batteries in e-scooters and e-bikes\". One online ABC article about the issue was originally posted with the false statement that \"Hundreds of e-scooters and e-bikes are catching fire in Australian homes...\" That wildly inaccurate bit of information has since been removed, but not before a [Google crawler indexed it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hundreds+of+e-scooters+and+e-bikes+are+catching+fire+in+Australian+homes)\n\nDespite media reports to the contrary, e-scooters and e-bikes are not bursting into flames at an alarming rate. Over 5.5 years to mid 2022, there were less than 100 lithium-ion battery fires in Australia reported to the ACCC; remember, a dozen or more lithium-ion battery containing products can be found in the average Australian home today, including in laptops, tablets, children's toys, drills, etc. [Only 9 (yes nine) of those fires were caused by batteries inside e-mobility devices.](https://consultation.accc.gov.au/accc/lithium-ion-batteries-issues-paper/supporting_documents/ACCC%20Lithiumion%20Batteries%20Issues%20Paper.pdf) Nine e-scooter and e-bike fires over 5.5 years, compared to 10's of thousands of car fires over the same period (speculative based on [&gt;9,000 car fires in NSW alone in just a 36-month period](https://www.fireextinguisheronline.com.au/blog/post/electric-vehicle-fire-extinguisher-australia)).\n\nSo why the media frenzy on these devices being a risk? Vehicle manufacturers and energy companies have been manipulating the media and controlling the narrative around transport options for 100 years now ([reference 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOttvpjJvAo), [reference 2](https://www.drilledpodcast.com/)), they are world renowned experts at [manufacturing consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU).\n\nIn urban areas, a substantial amount of the distance we drive is for short trips, easily achievable by e-mobility devices. In Sydney, [50% of all vehicle km driven are for trips less than 5km](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/HTS%20Report%20Sydney%202012-13.pdf). If we are allowed to view new e-mobility options as the cheap, convenient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, spatially sustainable, and relatively safe products that they are, then we'll stop driving cars as much as we do. In turn, we'd also start demanding governments do more to make our streets safer for those who aren't driving cars... which in turn will cause more people take up alternative transport options.\n\nLeft unchecked, e-mobility devices have the potential to significantly reduce the amount we drive cars in our cities; this will hurt the bottom line of amongst the richest and most powerful businesses in the world. Something they will not allow to happen without a fight. Their decades old signature move? Narrative control and media manipulation.\n\nTL:DR; E-scooters and e-bikes are not catching fire at the rate the media is portraying, not even remotely. It is likely the usual powers are at work to ensure the general public are terrified of any transport option that is not a privately owned car.",

      "text": "The title says it all, and I've just experienced two recent instances of drivers being absolute inconsiderate fucks on the road. Two days in a damn row, mind you. I live in the Inland Empire of Southern California, which, as much as I absolutely love, is unfortunately very heavily car-dependent. \n\nThe first was when I was riding my electric scooter to work yesterday morning. A driver in an older truck literally backed up on the right side of the fucking road, back to the intersection. I shit you not. Luckily, I stopped when the light turned red when the idiot was still backing up into the other road at the intersection. What an absolute dumbass. Like, who the fuck even does that shit? Why the fuck did they even turn right onto that street in the first place, then? \n\nThe second instance, though involving a motorcycle, literally just happened an hour ago. I was on a walk, and then this fucking idiot on a dirt bike was blocking the whole crosswalk while waiting for the light to turn green, even after I began crossing after waiting for the walk signal to appear. Well, right around when I finished crossing, this motherfucker decided it was a brilliant idea to just impatiently turn left onto a fucking sidewalk and just drive on it... where I just was a couple minutes back. Like, are you really that fucking inconsiderate of others and in that much of a rush? What if there was a pedestrian in front of them? The fuck is their problem?\n\nOh, yeah. Here's another similar story with another dirt bike rider. One afternoon, after I got off the bus after work, and as I walked up towards my house, yet another dumbass fucking idiot drove their dirt bike on the dirt off the street next to the sidewalk that I was walking on... in a direction heading towards ME! I wish I was joking. This occurred some time this past year. \n\nOh, and not to mention those times when I began crossing the street at a damn intersection, but someone still decides to start driving as I'm doing so, anyway. How fun is that? \n\nI just absolutely HATE it when those kind of drivers do all this fucking bullshit! Pisses me the fuck off!\n\nSo, yeah. I just wanted to rant about how those two occurrences are making me hate vehicles more lately. And, I said to myself that I've been wanting to practice more on driving. Yeah, right. I'm not even sure if it's worth continuing to do so, and it's exactly mainly because of all those fucking idiots just like them on the road! Fuck vehicles (yes, I realize my e-scooter counts as a vehicle, as well, but still)! Okay, except busses. They're cool with me, and I've been taking the bus for years, but that's besides the point.",

I saw the post comparing the number one selling car in the UK to the number one vehicle in the US which is the F150 which is almost the same comparison I did when I was comparing my car to buying an E-Bike. Earlier this year I sold my car to purchase an E-Bike. I think I saw an ad maybe a year ago or maybe it was somebody riding one but it really got me thinking, why do I need a 5 passenger car to drive me to work and back every single day? Literally 20 miles every day (M-F) of just me sitting in my car to get to work and back. I probably only transported maybe 3 people a year in my car FOR YEARS. I sat there starting at the wall like why am I screwing up the environment, wasting money, and using up space just for a thing to get me to a job. A place I go to as a way to pay for the thing that gets me to work. \n\nObviously I decided I didn't need the car. \n\nGroceries? \nCargo E-Bike can handle it. \n\nTransport kids?\n No worries bike can fit two kids seats.\n\nGetting to work? \nEasy peasy and only adds 30 minutes total to my daily commute.\n\nWhat about AC? \nYeah turns out riding at decent speed while wearing summer clothes keeps you pretty cool.\n\nCold? \nNo worries, the world has plenty of clothes to grab to keep you warm.

      "title": "Just because a City is Car Dependent, that doesn't Mean People aren't Making Choices... [long post]",
      "text": "This sub has... got weird lately.\n\nThere seems to be an increasing number of comments (and a few posts) that basically consist of:\n\n* Step One: somebody claims a person/people have agency and criticise how they use that agency\n* Step Two: someone else says \"don't hate the player, hate the game\" (or words to that effect)\n\nTo use a recent actual example that you can find with some detective work:\n\n&gt;The necessity of having a personal car is one of the biggest myths perpetuated in the U.S. and way overblown for many people\n&gt;&gt;I\u0019m glad that your lifestyle doesn\u0019t necessitate ownership of a car. I know the sub is literally called fuck cars lol, but they are a necessity for many of us. It requires far too much time and effort to ride a bike or bus to the store, to work, or to go anywhere else when you\u0019re in a hurry\n\nI guess respect to this guy for having the self awareness to know they're arguing against the thesis of r/fuckcars but I want to break down why comments like this are carbrained themselves. For my own convenience, I will use a case study of Auckland ([here are some pictures of what its suburbs looks like](https://imgur.com/a/gYVgnLe)).\n\nIn Auckland, [75% of pre-covid commute journeys were less than 12km long and 50% were less than 6km.](https://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2021/02/11/double-is-nothing/) These aren't walking distance trips but they are cycling distances... [a Google search](https://truecommuter.com/what-is-the-average-commuting-bike-speed/) tells me a *beginner* commuting cyclist can do 12km in 45 minutes and 6km in 22.5 minutes. A more experienced cyclist will bring those travel times down to 30 and 15 minutes (and, of course, there are ebikes to consider these days). [Nevertheless, some 73% of commutes in the data set are done in private vehicles](https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Report/TheCongestionQuestionsTechnicalReport.pdf) (10% as passengers, mind).\n\nChoosing to drive these commutes is a choice. And the more people that make this choice, the worse things are. Always remember, \"you're not in traffic, you are traffic\". \n\nIf you're a libertarian, congestion should really drive you up the wall... it's a situation where people refuse to take ownership of their own decisions and as a result inflict congestion, more pollution and dangerous parking behaviours on everyone else. And if you don't think this, you're not a libertarian. Now, if you're not a libertarian I'm sure you're wondering something along the lines of \"but how free is that choice, really?\" and you'd be right to wonder that.\n\nIn many respects, the answer (in Auckland) is \"not much\". Safe cycling infrastructure is mostly not a thing. However, some exists. In fact, there are a fair few Youtube videos showing some of it off (there are some geographic biases in the ones I've found). [This dude's demonstrates some of the pitfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9z-6i3uQ8Y)... shared paths and sections where you're just on an ordinary road. Of course, it's not just about cycling: there's also public transport.\n\nAuckland has a very simple to understand network. If you live in South Auckland proper, you're living close to a rail line. If you live in much of West Auckland, you're not so far from a rail line. If you live in inner East, there's a rail line. If you live on the North Shore, you're reasonably likely to be close to a bus rapid transit system that's largely responsible for creating some major modeshift on the Harbour Bridge (pre-Covid). And then if you live anywhere else, you've basically got bus connections (with sketchy priority) to these \"frequent\" and \"rapid\" links or ferries... lots of ferries.\n\nBefore Covid, this was a very reliable system but it wasn't necessarily fast. According to the timetables, the new electric trains (as in, electrification happened in 2014/15) with a 110km/h top speed, are no faster than 19th Century steam trains. However, a reliable 55 minute or so commute from 30km out isn't so bad. I know because I did it... and a lot of people did it, too: growth was *very* strong. Since Covid reliability has been way down because it turns out that the owner of the tracks doesn't do maintenance. Also, since delta timetables have been cut back and patronage is, I think, at something like 20% of its previous levels (in the halcyon days of Level One it was back to 60-70% of the pre-Covid levels).\n\nIn other words, I strongly believe that for the 75% of people with sub 12km commutes, the vast majority would have functional and reliable public transport options. They'd be slower than cars, but they wouldn't necessarily be egregiously so. And, sure, Western Line trains go no distance at all from the CBD compared to the Southern line (as the crow flies, the former's stations are almost all within 12km, the latter can be as much as 30km out) but an hour's commute is not so bad. My point being here is that \"slower\" doesn't necessarily mean \"too long\". There would need to be *some* adjustment of expectations *but that's not a bad thing.*\n\nOf course, it's not just about active modes and public transport either. People can make choices about how they're living. And I don't mean \"why don't you just live closer to your work?\". I mean, \"why do you own that vehicle specifically?\".\n\nAbsolutely no-one needs a double cab ute. Not a single soul. If you actually need a ute, you're not really travelling in circumstances where you've got passengers. If you are, you probably should have a van instead. Or, possibly, a station wagon.\n\nIt is true that car manufacturers have made a concerted effort to upsize vehicles. It is also true that they advertise in wildly misleading fashions (i.e. empty roads). However, if you're buying a vehicle, you can just choose to buy something else. You absolutely should be criticised for buying a vehicle that's bigger than your needs. You absolutely should be criticised for buying more vehicles than you need. No-one has taken away all the other (much cheaper, more fuel efficient, safer) kinds of vehicles: they are still on car lots waiting to be bought.\n\nNow, a common turn on r/auckland (and maybe here but I can't say with confidence I've seen such claims) is to protest that modern housing developments don't have enough parking spaces. On one hand, this is just a defence of parking minimums. You know, probably the most despised urban planning rule after single family dwelling prescriptions (R1 zoning)... though, none of the top 150 posts on this sub are directly about this (as far as I can tell, [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/smmv3j/just_imagine_all_the_space_that_could_have_been/) was the first I could find but there are lots of comments on the general theme of \"cars take up too much space\"). On the other hand, this is being used specifically as a defence of stuff like in a recent[xpost from](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/ts20k9/i_dont_have_words_for_this/) r/mildlyinfuriating, i.e. the privatisation of public space.\n\nIt is not remotely unreasonable to point out that if you can't afford to buy enough land to park your family's seven cars, you shouldn't own seven cars. This is a lifestyle *choice* people are choosing to make that is both derived from and exacerbating the poor design choices of carbrained cities like Auckland. It's probably also relatively easy to fix... I'm sure you've heard that in Japan, you can't buy a car unless you can prove you have private land to park it on (whether you own that space or lease it). I think this is why r/neoliberal is/was so anti-car... the whole system of the carbrained city is only able to exist because of mass subsidisation by the state, which is inefficient.\n\nSo, to sum up... I guess what I'm saying is:\n\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean your trips are actually too far to cycle\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean every possible cycling trip is unsafe\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean using public transport is excessively time consuming\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you *had* to buy a tank sized vehicle\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you need more cars than household members\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you should use public roads to store your cars\n\nAnd most importantly\n\n* just because you live in a carbrained city, that doesn't mean you have to defend carbrain!\n\nThere are lots of other choices that people make because of carbrain that if they just chose to do something else would make cars so much less problematic. If you can't come to r/fuckcars to criticise these choices (without having to qualify that you know some of them aren't wholly free choices), what is even the point of this sub?\n\nCarbrained cities are created and perpetuated because people like [Phil Goff (Auckland's mayor) use carbrained arguments](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/qmj23m/transport_agency_proposes_reducing_car_parking/). It is not enough to just recognise carbrained design, you also have to recognise the rhetoric that is used to defend and constitute it.",

      "text": "I went on a 5-day trip to Barcelona, where I got an electric bike pass for a week so I can get around easily. Thankfully, Barcelona is full of bike lanes and it should be trivial to get around without having to deal with cars and traffic. Or so i thought.\n\n  \n\n\nThe way the roads are structured there is pretty simple: There's a main car road with 6 lanes for cars, and on both sides of said road, there's a smaller single lane road for buses and bicycles. That way bikes and buses don't have to block traffic and cars don't have to inconvenience us. **Or so it would be if the drivers actually obeyed the rules.**\n\n  \n You see, cars don't care what those lanes were made for - they see a length of asphalt and they automatically assume that it's made for their stupid vehicle. The bike/bus lanes are FULL of cars, and because of that, they're always packed and it's impossible for buses and bikes to use them.\n\n  \n\n\n*Well*, you may say, *they at least know that they're using bike lanes and make space for the vehicles they were intended for*. Oh, you sweet summer child. While i was riding my bicycle **on the designated lane**, for my 4 days on bike, 13 cars passed me less than an inch away from me - 2 were **police cars -** and a lady even threw her empty soda cup at me. **These pigs don't consider us a part of traffic**.\n\nLastly, while i was riding my bike on the sidewalk, I noticed that there was a strip of asphalt made for wheelchairs and disabled people so they can ride smoothly. It wasn't connected to the main road, and for a car to use it, it would have to climb onto the curb and drive **like 20 yards on the sidewalk.** And guess what? *there was a fucking car on it*. A car, on a fucking strip of asphalt intended for disabled people. Jesus. Fucking. Christ.\n\n  \n\n\nA lack of infrastructure isn't the problem. Cars as a transport method are.",

Because of Car-centric infrastructure. ](https://preview.redd.it/4z18g7w8dvba1.jpg?width=919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d68188f058dc02767ea22adad988e072047f14)\n\nThe Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, popularly referred to as the 'Evo', is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to date. Lancer Evolutions were successful in WRC Rallies from 1996 to 1999, mostly in the hands of Finnish driver Tommi Mäkinen, clinching driver's titles in four-consecutive seasons from 1996 to 1999 (in Evolutions III, IV, V, and VI). Note that start date of 1992. Between 1992 and 2016, world population rose by over 1 billion, however our public transport infrastructure failed to adapt to this change appropriately, especially in the united states, with car dependent infrastructure. This then shifted the market for vehicles away from sports orientated vehicles, as more \"\"\"\"\"\"\"practical\"\"\"\"\"\"\" utility vehicles came into demand instead. Because of public transport not being adapted to the population change, more people needed \"commuter purpose\" vehicles, as they could not commute via alternative methods due to alternative methods either being overloaded and hence seen as unappealing (e.g. underdeveloped metros) or straight up absent (e.g. Intercity HighSpeed rail), limiting them to own a car that would be suited for more frequent use as opposed to a purpose sport vehicle. In late March 2014, it was revealed that the production of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution would end after the 2015 model year. Mitsubishi instead wished to focus on \"concentrating its efforts on crossover vehicles and electric vehicles instead.\"\n\nTL:DR; I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS  I HATE SUVS AND CROSSOVERS",

They use twice as much energy for the same range as a smaller car. \n\nSomething I also found while researching this mess is that particulate air pollution from tyre wear is already worse than tailpipe emissions in Europe. \n\nI would be surprised if electric pickups weren't actively worse for the environment than regular ICE or hybrid versions because of how inefficient they are, how many minerals they require, and how much more tyre wear they cause from the extra weight. \n\nIt's a little frustrating that EVs (specifically SUVs and trucks) are being pushed and even funded by the government as a green solution. I feel like it might distract from the bigger issue, which is that cars and car-centrism are unsustainable as a whole.",

      "text": "The other day I was riding my bike down this bike path, and this giant truck was parked fully on the bike path.\n\nWhile I was riding up to it, there was an elderly man sitting in one of those electric scooters, who was trying to ride around the truck, but hesitating because of cars.\n\nI got annoyed, so I stopped and went in the back where the driver was unloading. But instead of yelling at the driver, I asked the pizzeria owner if he could ask the driver to move his truck from the bike path, telling him that first of all it\u0019s illegal for motorized vehicles to even stop on the bike path or sidewalk, and secondly it was creating a dangerous situation where cyclists including children would have to drive into the street to get around the truck.\n\nAnd it worked! To my surprise the pizzeria owner talked to the driver, the driver stopped unloading and went out to move his truck off the bike path and onto the street, cars can easily get around.\n\nI\u0019m guessing the pizzeria owner didn\u0019t want to risk a bad review of his place.\n\nOf course I then go to ÿMaps and look at their version of Streetview, called [Look Around](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi-Up8Xuh9c) and see that a truck is parked half on the bike path and half on the bike path.\n\n#This is why we need fucking curbs",

      "text": "If you dont know what technicals are, they are basically a Toyota Hilux single cab pick up truck with a DSHK HMG bolted on a swiveling pintle to the truck bed. Ever since the Toyota war between Chad and Libya more or less pioneered the technical, every conflict ever since including Ukraine and Myanmar has been using the \"light\" (in military terms, but very heavy in civilian terms) vehicles and light weaponry as a very effective low cost tactic of fighting asymmetrical warfare.\n\nEven lighter vehicles have been employed in combat roles, WW2 had motorcycles with sidecar mounted machine guns, today's insurgencies commonly use motorcycle technicals with rpk's mounted on them. I thought based on that, why couldn't we do the same with bicycles and ebikes?\n\nBicycle mounted infantry had been a relatively common tactic from 1890-1910, the Nazis confiscated bicycles from occupied territories to serve as transport vehicles for their armed forces, and in the modern age with cargo ebikes being able to carry an adult passenger and a total mass of 250+ kg, I don't see why something like the [Propel Urban Arrow](https://propelbikes.com/product/urban-arrow-family-cargo/) or any analog or electric bakfiet couldn't have a pintle mounted machine gun in the front cargo basket or otherwise be used as a patrol / logistics vehicle, especially in places where full sized automobiles and trucks are too big to fit or otherwise are inadvisable.\n\nWhile I am aware the Ukrainian ebikes seen in [this article](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html) are more like Surrons and e motorcycles, the same concepts of micromobility in combat still apply to lighter ebikes imo. They dont use gasoline, they are quiet and far less detectable via sound and thermal signature, the fact that they are smaller than cars means they are smaller targets and take up less space, they can be recharged by the electrical grid assuming its still running in the area of operations, and even with dead batteries, they carry more cargo at a faster speed than personnel on foot.\n\nThis is definitely an idea i would say most of the pro 2nd crowd in the USA is completely overlooking in their blind support for rolling coal and lifted trucks.",

      "title": "Putting highways in tunnels is a band-aid. Cars are the root of the problem.",
      "text": "Cars suck. They\u0019re smelly and noisy. Ideally, we want them to be *out* of city-centers.\n\nThere have been a [few recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/vbf2dz/so_near_and_yet_so_far/) on this sub which suggested that cities should move car traffic underground and redevelop the surface to create spaces like the Rose Kennedy Greenway in Boston.\n\nThe resulting greenway is Nice\", so on the \"surface\", this seems like a pretty good idea, right? (pun intended).\n\nUndoubtedly, Elon Musk\u0019s Tesla Tunnels have contributed to this idea\u0019s popularity, but, like everything else from Papa Musk, it\u0019s actually not that great when you apply critical thinking.\n\nLet\u0019s look at the [Big Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig), what it accomplished, and how much it actually cost.\n\nThe Big Dig has been estimated to have a total cost of **\\~$22 Billion**\n\n\u001cIn total, the project built 161 lane-miles of highway, about half in tunnels, and four major highway interchanges\u001d\n\nThe money was not just spent building tunnels, it was also spent demolishing the existing elevated highway and creating the Rose Kennedy Greenway. It also includes many expenses that are not directly involved with \u001c*just digging a tunnel\u001d*, such as design work by an engineering firm, eminent domain to obtain the required land rights, moving existing infrastructure out of the tunnel path (i.e. water mains and sewage lines), having a worker go out and place traffic cones for a road closure - it all factors in. Especially the expenses your average person never even considers.\n\nContrary to what Elon Musk would have you believe, it\u0019s not as simple as \u001c*just digging a tunnel*\u001d.\n\nWe\u0019ll use the Big Dig as a benchmark for the use of tunnels to replace surface highways. To this point, we must assume that, to put a highway into a tunnel, work must be done on the surface to feed traffic into the tunnel. This might result in the creation of new surface lanes.\n\nThe Big Dig had mistakes that ran up the budget. We *can* say that we\u0019ve learned from those mistakes and won\u0019t repeat them, but there will be new mistakes, there will be lawsuits (there always are). There will be unpredictable situations that pop up during construction that cause delays and work stoppage.\n\nFor example, suppose that during the process of digging a tunnel, it is discovered that the geological conditions in a certain spot will cause the tunnel to eventually collapse.\n\n* Option 1, the tunnel can be redirected around the problem area.\n* Option 2, additional excavation and reinforcement can allow the tunnel to be placed in the original spot.\n\nBoth solutions cause unplanned expenses and delays.\n\nFurthermore, different regions have different conditions. In the southern US, a high concentration of clay in the soil causes excavation to be more expensive, structures below-grade must be reinforced against hydrostatic pressure, and extensive pumping &amp; draining must be installed. On the US west coast, earthquakes are a considerable risk. Tunnels require additional reinforcement to avoid being sheared during lateral movement from an earthquake (causing the tunnel to be cut off from the surface).\n\nWhile tunnels *may* be built at a lower cost in ideal regions (Midwest, Great Plains), other regions may see higher costs for tunnels. We also have to account for future inflation. Even if we could do the Big Dig again for \u001cless\u001d than $22bn, inflation might eat up our \u001csavings\u001d before the project is complete.\n\nUltimately, we can set the Big Dig as a per-lane-mile benchmark upon which the cost of putting lanes underground (in any given area) averages out.\n\nPer Lane-Mile: If you have a 1-Mile long tunnel with two lanes of roadway in it, you have 2 Lane-Miles\n\nThe Big Dig resulted in 80 lane-miles in tunnels. It cost $22 Billion\n\nThe cost per Lane-Mile is $275,000,000\n\nNow let\u0019s apply this on a broader scale. Let\u0019s assume that a random metro area in the US wants to bury some urban highways (or other arterial roads) and create surface greenways in the land footprint of the current highways.\n\nFor the sake of the argument, let\u0019s assume a metro area wants to create 200 lane-miles in tunnels in/around their downtown, and redevelop the surface space into greenway.\n\nThis comes to a cost of **$55,000,000,000 (Fifty Five Billion Dollars)** for this ONE metro area.\n\nWhat do they really gain?\n\nBoston tried it and it didn't solve their car-dependence. Sure, it made downtown Boston a much more pleasant place, but it continued to enable people to live far away and drive. Ultimately, those cars come back up to the surface when they get off the highway, and there they are polluting the city with exhaust and noise.\n\nSo for $55 Billion, you basically just get to hide your highways, pretty your downtown, and not much else.\n\nLet\u0019s put this in perspective. What kind of public transit could we provide for **$55 billion**?\n\nNYC has the largest municipal bus fleet in the US: \u001cIts fleet of 5,725 buses is the largest municipal bus fleet in the United States and operates 24/7.\u001d It also serves some 14,000 bus stops.\n\n**For $55 Billion, instead of burying their highways, this** ***ONE*** **metro area could:**\n\n* Make commuter cars illegal to drive in the city (service vehicles would still be allowed with a permit).\n* Buy **30,000** fully electric busses (**$24 Billion**)\n* Build **20,000** sheltered bus stops with bathrooms, drinking fountains, and an overhead charger for the busses to use while stopped (**$1 billion**)\n* Spend **$5 Billion** reclaiming tens of thousands of unneeded lane-miles of surface-level streets and stroads (reclaimed lanes could be turned into bike lanes, sidewalks that didn\u0019t exist before, or just planted to help reduce water runoff, soak up sunlight and reduce heat).\n* Have **$25 billion** left over to pay drivers and run the buses every 15 minutes (resulting in the transit system being fare-free).\n* Additionally, it would make hundreds of acres of surface parking lots obsolete and available for redevelopment.\n\nCar tunnels are just more car-infrastructure. It's just one more expense.\n\nIt'd be better to just improve public transit and take cars off the road in the first place.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big\\_Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig)\n\n[https://www.mass.gov/info-details/the-big-dig-facts-and-figures](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/the-big-dig-facts-and-figures)\n\n[https://www.liveabout.com/bus-cost-to-purchase-and-operate-2798845](https://www.liveabout.com/bus-cost-to-purchase-and-operate-2798845)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA\\_Regional\\_Bus\\_Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA_Regional_Bus_Operations)\n\n[https://www.ny.com/transportation/buses/ridebuses.html](https://www.ny.com/transportation/buses/ridebuses.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: links didn't format right",

Overall making fun on anyone who cares about the environment because we all use and consume stuff and so aren't we just laughable hypocrites.\n\nI said i actually don't think electric cars will solve our environmental problems or help us develop more sustainable cities.  I said i don't feel people that own them are inherently better, some people buy them for status symbols, I know they take up energy and batteries have mined lithium.  I said better planning of cities and development where less people have to use cars and getting less cars on the road is a more important goal.  It could even make it better for those who want to drive and emergency vehicles if there is less traffic.\n\nStill I get most people currently in the US have to deal with a reality where you have to drive.  I'm not the one judging someone for having a car, electric or not, i don't know their situation.  And the state of our electric grid is not an individual person's fault even if we can make the choice to use less energy.  I overheat easy and I live in Florida, I'm using AC.  I like that options for different kind of vehicles exist, we need to look at all options even if i don't think it is THE solution and that ultimately we need less cars.  And that i don't like the idea that if you can't be perfect it is not worth doing something at all. \n\nBoth of my comments got a laugh react from them.  \n\nI can't explain how much it hurts to try so hard to be reasonable and understanding and get laugh reacts.

Typically there are still 1-2 parking spaces per house but these don't take up much more additional space. This mixture of developments allows for more density and a wider pallette of income groups.\n\nCommercial developments and stores are also allowed.\n\nFurthermore, larger industry is allowed and situated at the edge so no one is disturbed by it.\n\nThese businesses bring money to the town, help it prosper and keep a positive balance sheet.\n\nAlso: no HOA! Nobody can dictate how your house/garden has to look like (except zoning laws, of course) and additionally new developments aren't carried out by large corporations so there are no neighbourhoods made completely out of similar looking houses.\n\n\n\n2) infrastructure\n\nThere is regular bus service from 5:30 to 23:30 on weekdays and from 00:00 to 3:30 / 5:30 to 00:00 on weekends.\n\n-&gt; Connections to the rest of the country are very good, meaning I can get away 80 km from home in an hour just by public transit.\n\n*I do need to add though that transit is way to expensive here which is one major drawback\n\nFurthermore, residential streets are narrow and don't allow more than 30km/h. The main road has two lanes, one for each direction and is capped at 50km/h. So you can comfortably cycle through the town in in residential streets (or one the main road, even though it's less pleasant) and walk on the continuous sidewalk. These things allow people to live without a car, reduce sprawling as less land is zoned for roads or parking.\n\n\n\n3) small businesses\n\nSmaller services such as hairdressers don't require a large customer base and are thus ideal for serving your village or maybe additionally your neighbour village. It's completely possible to run a business in your home or use part of your property for business.\n\n \n\n4) financing\n\nThere is no large town here that could support the suburbs. Thus single-family developments have to be paid for and aren't carried by subsidies. This isn't that tragic though as most middle class citizens can afford multi- or single family homes - their cost is reduced by not being dependent on a car and not being far away from everything else.\n\nIf you can't afford that you can still rent an apartment!\n\n\n\nSo, according to some people this place here should be an overdense shithole? Not at all, it's peaceful, spacious and there are a lot of green spaces.\n\nAll in all, I like how we do things here. Reducing car dependency leads to more flexibility in life, more prosperity and more communal, liveable places and I hope this way of building towns becomes commonplace everywhere.",

      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

Since 1990, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the weight of the average pickup has increased by twelve hundred and fifty-six pounds\u0014thirty-two per cent. A recent post on Vice observed that the largest pickups and S.U.V.s today are as big as Second World War-era tanks. Now pickups are going to get heavier still. The Lightning, because of its lithium-ion battery, weighs approximately sixty-five hundred pounds; in some cases the pickup can be more than two thousand pounds heavier than its gas counterpart. You\u0019ll be capable of assaulting a mountaintop redoubt, even if you\u0019re just driving to the store for milk.\n\nNot only are large E.V.s not as green as smaller E.V.s.; what about all the people who aren\u0019t in big vehicles? Analysis from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has shown that pedestrians who are hit by pickups or S.U.V.s are two to three times more likely to die than those who are hit by cars. In fact, the number of pedestrians killed by vehicles rose forty-six per cent between 2010 and 2019. According to the Governors Highway Safety Association, if you count deaths against vehicle miles travelled, 2020 saw the largest increase in pedestrian fatalities (twenty-one per cent) since nationwide tracking started, in 1975. Even though fewer vehicles were on the road early in the pandemic, more people died.\"\n\nIn my opinion electrifying is not the solution.\n\nLet's have a meaningful discussion about this.",

Gave me a whole day to use it, and therefore to charge it, so I chose an electric car. I\u0019ll come back to it in a moment.\n\nHaving full access to a car, on-demand, made me understand why carbrains say cars are freedom. Because it does feel like that.\nOf course I am but too aware of the issues and costs of a car, so I could tamper the feeling. But anyone in car culture will not. They will only feel that \"freedom\" which comes with their car.\n\nNote that one could feel similar with a bike, but my experience here got exacerbated by how I didn\u0019t have access to a bike at the moment (on vacation).\n\nAs for the electric car - compared to a gas car. Super fun to drive, ngl. On sunday, while I was looking for a charger, I tried the acceleration on an empty parking lot. Blissful and exhilarating experience. Such a pain in the ass to charge though.\n\nI had a small car (Peugeot e208), 50kWh battery. Fully charging it on the wall outlet would have taken 50h, so I went to find a charger. What a nightmare. Not only is it not that much cheaper than gas for a fuel-efficient vehicle, but you must give up your privacy to charge your car. It\u0019s not like the gas pump, you have to use a website to pay, and enter your email address, when it doesn\u0019t force you to create an account and store your credit card info on their server.\n\nIn the end, 5/10. If I don\u0019t have to deal with the charge, I\u0019ll happily rent an electric car again (if I need a car ofc).\n\nIf I ever get a car, it will be a station wagon or minivan, when I\u0019ll have at least 4 children (or maybe 3, trains don\u0019t usually have 5/6-seat spaces), and it will be a diesel, only used to carry the family across the country on vacation, or to bring absurd amounts of shit to the recycling plant.",

Ask for this to apply to ebikes, e-scooters, and e-motorcyles as well. \n\n[https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2022-0985-1423](https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2022-0985-1423)",

      "text": "As a non-American I'm shocked by the fact you can't get to literally any place in the country by train. My city is literally based around public transport and despite the fact the car road system is decent as well and both of them being constantly upgraded, owning a car here is controversial at best and unreasonable at worst.\n\nIn my city of Moscow I can get literally anywhere on the map in 30 min from the center within city limits (and Moscow ain't a small city), 50-60 within close to mid suburban. It takes around 50 minutes to get from the northern border to the southern and vice versa. 85% of city limits are reachable by metro + 5-15 min walk, for further places busses course regularly (mostly EV ones). Also there are plenty of alternative public transportation as well like trams, trolleys, suburban trains (my personal favorite), monorail, a few cable car routes and recently even river trams were proposed. And for those rare occasions where you absolutely need a personal car there's a very extensive car sharing service starting from 12 RUB/min (about 19 cents). \n\nTaxis are also very numerous and cheap, a ride on a Polo/Rio/Solaris class across the city border to border will cost you about 600-800 rub (10-15 bucks) depending on current demand. Better vehicles like Passat/Optima/Sonata will be around 20 bucks, and for 50+ you'll ride the s-class like a chad. A single universal ticket for metro/buss/train/tram costs 55 rub (about 85 cents), a card for a week or more will be like twice as cheap per ride. This is much much more economic than having your own car, especially when you take parking prices, gas etc. into the account. \n\nI'm 22 y. o. and I can't even imagine myself owning a car without a solid reason like having 3+ kids or a personal business or a job somewhere unreachable by other transport and even then 2/3 cases an alternative like a car sharing or taxi would be better and cheaper in long term. \n\nThe point is when the city has a proper public transportation system, cars become obsolete and irrelevant, and because of that mayor administration plans to close the city center for cars entirely by 2030 and even now about 30-40% of streets are pedestrian only and parking prices within the historical center are outrageous. \n\nMy hot take is that cars should be regulated like guns are (edit: like in EU or here in Russia), so in order to get one you'd have to go through multiple examinations, mandatory extreme driving classes for better driving skills in extreme situations, get a special permission from the city, and of course be taxed minimum twice the value as well as spare parts for them. Gas should be taxed even more, minimum 80% of its price being excise price tax, like cigarettes and booze. The state should discourage new car purchases by all means necessary, personal transport in a modern city is simply an unnecessary luxury and should be treated as such.\n\nEVs and hybrids are just as bad unless you're planning to use them for 10+ years and don't change your battery even once, because otherwise you're not only not reducing emissions and pollution but increasing it, it's just being released elsewhere. Don't fool yourself.",

      "title": "Welcome to /r/Fuckcars",
      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

      "text": "From **Quartz**: [Trump's running mate J.D. Vance wants tax rebates for gas cars instead of EVs](https://qz.com/jd-vance-trump-gas-car-rebates-evs-1851594703)\n\n&gt;*As recently as 2020 Vance was seen praising solar energy and begged for a \u001cclean energy future\u001d to cure the \u001cclimate problem in our society.\u001d When it became clear to him that he\u0019d need Donald Trump\u0019s endorsement to win the Ohio senate race, he began a dramatic shift his positions on climate denialism and fossil fuels. This bill proved to Trump that Vance would kiss the ring in exchange for power, killing the old Vance to grow a new one in his image.*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*The Drive American Act seeks to gut the Biden administration\u0019s electric vehicle tax rebate program, with the first half of the bill undoing the program altogether. In the latter half of the bill, Vance proposes that American taxpayers follow him into a ridiculously circular logic that would instead place up to a $7,500 rebate on all new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, trucks, and SUVs. Vehicles with larger payloads and more seats would be eligible for more of the incentive. In order to take advantage of this, you\u0019d need to live in a household making less than $300,000, and the vehicle could not exceed $80,00o. Both \u001climits\u001d are well north of average.* ",

      "text": "Not sure if this has been posted yet.. couldn't find it anyways - but we got featured in Carbrain monthly! Be sure to check out the comments section for some great nuanced takes from the car persons. (/s)\n\n[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you imagine your life without a car or a truck? Do you see yourself biking to work or taking the bus every single day? Are you ready to carry groceries and supplies like in the old days? Well, this is what some people are dreaming of. We\u0019re not talking about 100, 1,000, or 10,000 people. No, there are over 217,000 supporters of the anti-car movement! It\u0019s worth understanding what they want, since these ideas tend to spread like wildfire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to a subreddit that has a very explicit name, people that are in favor of banning cars are not looking to make emergency vehicles disappear, they don\u0019t want to disrupt the supply chains dependent on trucks, and don\u0019t look at rural communities to make their plan happen. They also underline that the initiative isn\u0019t political and doesn\u0019t adhere to any set of \u001cleft\u001d or \u001cright\u001d values and beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What these guys and gals wish is to make everyone aware of the cost that we must all support because cars became so important for almost anything we do. This is clearer now that we\u0019ve all gradually returned to normal office hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-car community essentially agrees that building the roads and the needed utilities creates \u001can unwanted economic burden on communities\u001d that has proven to be costly everywhere, especially when you look at the yearly amount of dollars spent on maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they say this won\u0019t stop with the switch to all-electric and self-driving cars, since charging and moving around without human control will almost certainly guarantee the number of vehicles won\u0019t come down, and more money will be needed for charging and resting spots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Not enough room for everyone**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People also think cities give too much space to cars, parking, and gas or charging stations. They want more parks, schools, homes, and businesses instead of vehicles in populated urban areas. Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand, which translates into more cars everywhere if roads are widened and parking spots are created.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These online activists also underline that not everyone can simply buy and drive a vehicle. They say children, teenagers, impoverished parents and adults, and those unable to drive suffer a lot in \u001ccar-centric cities.\u001d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-car movement supporters also argue motor vehicles are dangerous. Occupants may benefit from increased levels of protection as automotive technology evolves and companies create new materials that are lighter, stronger, yet dissipate impact energy in a very efficient way, but those that are not in a car might not survive an impact with one \u0013 something that everybody knows since childhood. But these people insist exercising any *\u001cform of car-free liberty\u001d* is automatically linked to constant threat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They also say cars are nurturing isolation, since people don\u0019t meet so often to have a chat on a sidewalk. You may be inclined to bring up car communities and events, but keep in mind activists are only referring to city life. Urban dwellers might enjoy some more space for weekend activities or just walk to and from work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A change must happen, but not like this**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, the idea to ban cars remains a discussion on [a popular forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/). But the number of people that agree with this idea is frightening. It\u0019s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much, but giving up on fossil fuels and designing better cities might just do the trick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A change is clearly needed, but it can\u0019t happen without motor vehicles. They are an integral part of the U.S. (and the world) and of a major industry, while some certain models create entire communities, and even inspire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All in all, banning cars from public roads and crowded cities might be applicable in specific cases or in some locations, but the U.S. is not ready in any way, shape, or form to give up entirely on motor vehicles. New York City is already struggling with keeping traffic under control after they\u0019ve made more space for bicycles and buses. People have various needs when it comes to reaching different destinations, and we can\u0019t take the comfort of knowing they can go everywhere they need at any given time without offering a public infrastructure that\u0019s working continuously and without delays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle, be it a battery-electric or a fuel-cell (hydrogen) one.",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That\u0019s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.\u001d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/air-pollution-in-nsw-causes-603-premature-deaths-and-costs-48bn-a-year-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\n**The NSW Clean Air Strategy 2021-2030**\n\n\nDoes address cars and trucks with:\n\n*Zero Emissions Bus Transition Strategy* to transition to electric battery buses and hydrogen fuel cell technology. \n\n*Walking and Cycling Program*  to create cycling and walking connections/parths around Sydney.\n\n *NSW Electric Vehicle Strategy* to increase electric vehicle use through government rebates and building charges.",

      "text": "Every time a thread about electric vehicles surfaces, carbrains crawl from the woodworks to defend their precious death boxes with the same shitty \"lesser of two evils\" rhetoric espoused by every centrist market liberal in the western political sphere. This rhetoric is designed to kill all movement and political inspiration towards mass transit and a concerted transformation of how we move around our local space and the world at large. \n\nThey fight only to preserve auto manufacturers and car oriented infrastructure by shaming those who want an end to cars; they find it totally acceptable to abandon the radical demands for an evolution in movement for the \"cars will always exist, let's just make the best of it\" cop out garbage.\n\nBeyond climate degredation, cars fucking suck for myriad other reasons, the most profound of which is that they fucking kill tens of thousands of people a year in the US alone. Electric vehicles will still make our lives worse, prevent our cities and suburbs and villages from changing and connecting, send us to the hospital and the grave even, and for what? A pitiful reduction in carbon emissions that won't put us anywhere near the reductions we need to save the world as we know it? The preservation and proliferation of the private capital of auto manufacturers, which will continue to erode our lives and living spaces for its own gain? All Because some quasi auto industry shills had the gal to convince people around the world, who wanted REAL change, that cars (or personal vehicles, if you're reading this and really want to get pedantic about it) were just \"always going to exist\"? They fucking won't, and in time people will look back to this era of history and see cars as they are now with horror and perplexity, the same way we now regard the use of leeches to treat disease. No one could not possibly be groveling harder for corporate and private capitalist supremacy, the inherent political enemy of public transit and public well being. \n\nRadical voices might not be a majority, but it takes radical voices to inspire into the social imagination a new way of thinking about the world, to open the minds of the majority to the idea that our lives can exist completely without personal vehicles, that anywhere humans build settlement CAN be connected to reliable public transit, and that in such a world, our lives can be so much better. Electric vehicles won't, in even beyond-possible scenarios of success, save us from climate catastrophe. A fully mobilized transition to mass transit could actually give us a shot at avoiding catastrophe. To make this possible, it must first be imagined, it must be believed, and this is a perfect space to contribute to that imagination, but it's terribly impeded from happening when so many car brains brigade any given thread with their fresh-from-the-shit-spigot platitudes commanding that everyone get in line with the neo-liberal agenda. \n\n\nThis place is called Fuck Cars, and I say that we all get on board with the idea that Fuck Cars means Fuck ALL Cars",

      "text": "Since their start, Tyre Extinguishers has often appeared in this sub, drawing praise and criticism. Not everyone in this sub appreciates deflating tyres of SUVs to make a point.\n\nAs a result, all TX posts see a flood of similar comments opposing their actions. Unfortunately, many arguments are based on misunderstanding what TX actually is and does or what direct action entails.\n\nWhile obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it would be a shame if we kept running around and regurgitating the same talking points. So, to help the discussion move along, here's a list of commonly used thoughts on why TX sucks, with a short reaction.\n\n\\---\n\n* **This will only aggravate SUV drivers and turn them against your cause.**  \nEverything you do to prevent people from driving more and larger SUVs will turn SUV drivers against you. To quote a wise man or woman: 'If a protest doesn't inconvenience, it's not a protest; it's a picnic.' TX is not looking to make friends with drivers. They want unnecessary SUVs off the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is dangerous. Letting people drive around with deflated tyres is incredibly irresponsible.**  \nTX leaves a leaflet on the windshield to alert drivers that their tyres are deflated. That, combined with possible warning lights in the car and the fact that any driver will quickly notice a flat tyre, means the real chance of someone driving off with their flat tyre is negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **So now a diesel-powered tow truck has to make extra trips to get the SUV back on the road? I'm suddenly pretending to be hyper-focused on emissions, and this seems counter-productive.**  \nThe goal of deflating tyres is not to reduce the number of trips of that particular vehicle. Instead, TX is after the large-scale systemic change by spreading its message far and wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Some people live where a car is the only option, you know?**  \nThen TX will be no problem. They clearly state they only operate in urban environments. So nobody will have their tyres deflated in the suburbs or rural areas. Not by TX, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is not an effective way to spread your message.**  \nLiterally, hundreds and hundreds of news articles from all over the world, including some really nuanced background stories in some of the most prominent outlets, beg to differ. TX has been remarkably effective in spreading its anti-SUV arguments to the general audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Imagine being a single mother with three jobs/a poor worker just trying to get by and finding your tyres deflated, with no money to call roadside service and now you lose your job and whaa-whaa!**  \nTX clearly states they target posh vehicles in upscale neighbourhoods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **What if people need to haul stuff for their work? Or need a large vehicle to store their wheelchair?**  \nTX clearly states they don't target vehicles clearly marked as for work or for disabled or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This will do nothing to reduce the number of cars on the road.**  \nTX clearly states they are against SUVs and large 4x4s in urban area's. They are unnecessarily dangerous and polluting. TX are not anti-car per se.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Why target innocent individuals? They should target oil companies/car manufacturers/car dealers/politicians instead!**  \nPlease look at this handy '[Moderates guide to doing absolutely nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/y30j3q/based_on_actual_conversations_on_this_sub/)' made especially for you.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **We support slashing tyres now?**  \nTX doesn't slash tyres. They deflate them. Pump 'em back up, and SUVs are back on the road; message sent, no damage done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I've thought up a scenario where someone who doesn't deserve it is still terribly inconvenienced by their flat tyre. But I bet you haven't considered that, huh?!**  \nSince around 35 million SUVs were sold in 2021 alone (roughly 45 per cent of all cars sold), and TX claims to have deflated 10,000 vehicles in just over half a year, that scenario is implausible.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I heard they deflate the tyres of eSUVs and hybrids as well, proving my theory that they are not environmentalists, just hooligans.**  \nElectric or hybrid SUVs are still unsafe and, in many cases, unnecessary. Furthermore, tailpipe emissions are not the only pollution. Besides the large carbon footprint these enormous cars have, tyre wear causes tremendous particle pollution. eSUVS are typically heavier and have more torque, causing more strain on tyres and thus polluting more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I understand their point, but I am against touching people's personal stuff.**  \nFair enough. But remember that SUVs are more dangerous for those not inside that vehicle, take up more public space and emit more pollution for you to breathe in. They mess with you personally every day, and drivers seem to either not know or not care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **If you want to get your point across, why not attend a protest? Why not take up a role in your local government? Why not do this or that?**  \nAll of those things can exist together. Disruptive direct action is not a substitute for protesting or actively shaping policy. It's an addition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **There are better ways to protest.**  \nPlease leave them in the comments so we can learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTX have [a website](https://www.tyreextinguishers.com/) where you can read what they do and why they do it. Makes of lot of comments in this sub redundant.",

They use twice as much energy for the same range as a smaller car. \n\nSomething I also found while researching this mess is that particulate air pollution from tyre wear is already worse than tailpipe emissions in Europe. \n\nI would be surprised if electric pickups weren't actively worse for the environment than regular ICE or hybrid versions because of how inefficient they are, how many minerals they require, and how much more tyre wear they cause from the extra weight. \n\nIt's a little frustrating that EVs (specifically SUVs and trucks) are being pushed and even funded by the government as a green solution. I feel like it might distract from the bigger issue, which is that cars and car-centrism are unsustainable as a whole.",

      "text": "And all of this under a post showing how the US lost much of its train network through the decades, ironically enough. Seriously where do people get this idea and how do we convince people that it's not a conspiracy? \n\nThe question is kind of rhetorical as many people making such claims have per-confirmed beliefs which say otherwise (which automatically means they're right to them despite not posting any sources) and will not listen to reason no matter how sound it is.\n\nYou're telling me that car manufacturers making bigger and bigger vehicles (US ones in particular as this wasn't the norm in the world) for seemingly no reason, suddenly saying how everyone needs all of that \"utility and size\" and phasing out smaller, older cars and their parts isn't them manipulating the market and making people pay more for more fuel inefficient, dangerous vehicles. (And I fucking love how apparently the entire US suddenly lives in a secluded part of the country in some log cabin with no electricity, with having to drive 50 miles through ice and snow, and they say they all need their trucks, riiiiiiiight)\n\n  \nYou're telling me they didn't lobby politicians to build more roads and highways, often bulldozing poor, POC neighbourhoods which were areas of dense housing, and if it wasn't that it was bulldozed to construct bunch of samey looking single family homes (with car garages ofc).\n\nYou're telling me, that, back when cars were first introduced en masse, they caused a bunch of crashes but didn't try to victim blame pedestrians so they can make roads more friendly for cars. Yeah a world that was so used to walking on roads were all very happy suddenly that roads were excluded from walking on said roads, totally.\n\nYou're telling me that, despite the US being very similar to the rest of the world before cars and that almost every town and village had some rail connecting them to larger cities, it's just that rail fell out of favour and no one was using it anymore suddenly (because buying cars worth thousands was apparently a very enticing financial decision), so that's why rail closed down has got nothing to do with the auto industry.\n\nYou're also telling me that it's not the autoindustry's fault that public transit, dense housing, better cycling infrastructure and such faces MASSIVE backlash and protests from people who they totally didn't carwash? (Reminder, Elon Musk admitted to sabotaging the Californian High Speed Rail project)\n\nLet's also not mention other dumb shit which the auto industry totally didn't try to play down and play dumb... Like adding lead to fuel, ignoring warnings and its sideffects for... decades... \n\nEven if all of this was just a huge coincidence (it absolutely wasn't), then it's the dumbest, most unfortunate and selfish (and in some conscious decisions, extremely vile and racist ) set of circumstances the US (and other parts of the world) got themselves into.\n\nSo, what the fuck? How do you even keep up with these mental gymnastics? I'm asking as a genuine question.\n\nI get it, all corporations bend the truth and play dirty tricks for profits, but why is it suddenly the car and oil industry that were angels the whole time?",

It ended production of the eUp (the electric version of the Up) last year. We urgently need legislation that limits the size of cars. It's ridiculous that they are ending sales of these sorts of cars to force people into buying more expensive, larger and dangerous models.\n\nWhen I moved to the UK from the Middle East, I went from driving a LWB Mitsubishi Shogun to an Up.

Parking went from being a chore to being almost fun.\n\nWe absolutely should be looking to reduce the number of cars in our cities and towns, but these are precisely the types of cars that should be left at the end of that purge; not the massive wankpanzers these companies seem insistent on selling.",

In some ways I think EVs are worse because it keeps us from making progress in creating more functional and climate friendly cities. I know that's an oversimplification. I'm in support of electric buses or public transit for example, but individual cars are the problem.\n\nI'm willing to be persuaded if someone knows more about it.

      "text": "&gt;July 29, 2024\n\n&gt;The report makes it clear that DOT isn't the only agency that will be blamed if we can't clean up our transportation system \u0014 Congress, state highway offices, and local leaders all need to take a hard look in the mirror if they want to prevent the worst.\n\n&gt;That's in large part, the report suggests, because no level of government has been aggressive enough about reducing how much Americans drive. One recent study cited in the paper found that the only path to meaningful emissions reduction that still allowed for VMT growth required both 80 percent of the vehicle fleet to be electrified by 2050, and the total decarbonization of the electrical grid \u0014 and even then, it just barely squeaked in under the line. Meanwhile, experts estimate that only 30 percent of cars will have batteries by midcentury.\n\n&gt;Or, as the report authors put it bluntly: \"The U.S. will not be able to decarbonize the transportation sector by midcentury without addressing increased demand.\" \n\n&gt;That harsh reality was also underscored in more subtle ways throughout the report, which routinely placed policies that support biking, walking, transit, and other non-automotive modes at the top of its various lists of decarbonization strategies.\n\n&gt;Specifically, DOT says the agency and all of its partners in government will need to \"increase convenience\" by decreasing the distance Americans need to travel to key destinations (and the safety they can expect along the journey), as well as \"improving efficiency\" by supporting mass transportation and better freight strategies.\n\n&gt;\"Increasing clean options\" like electric vehicles was the third item on its list. \n\n(editorial continues)\n\nChart: https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2024/07/AEO-chart.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75\n\n[https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change)\n\nFound the post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/1efhtm9/usdot_warns_congress_that_americans_need_to_drive/ (do not vote if you're not a subscriber there)",

I commuted during my undergrad and it deteriorated my quality of life so drastically \u0013 in addition to being terrible for the environment, expensive, dangerous (auto accidents are among the [leading causes of death](https://wisqars.cdc.gov/data/lcd/home) for the 20 \u0013 44 age group)  - that I have since planned my life around never needing a car. It hasn\u0019t been easy, but it came with many positives \u0013 enjoying my local neighborhood and city more, relying on and supporting local businesses and services, growing in awareness of the importance of accessibility, and especially in keeping me healthy from walking or biking everywhere. \n\nWhat has been worse during the past decade-plus, though, is the stigma that came with not having a car. Even progressive folk I\u0019ve met who understand the environmental impact and injustice of car-centered cities (as well as the [racist history](https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2021-11-11/the-racist-history-of-americas-interstate-highway-boom) behind freeways and the deconstruction of public transit) can\u0019t comprehend life without a car much less policy and city-planning that moves away from the necessity of cars. \u001cCar brain,\u001d as this sub has come to call it, is so widespread and deeply rooted in the U.S. that it prevents people from seeing a healthier, safer, and more environmentally friendly alternative right in front of them in their very cities. (For instance, in the obsession with electric vehicles as this mythical solution to climate change, which doesn't question the underlying destructive, unsustainable system of infrastructure behind reliance on personal vehicles for transportation.)\n\nJoining this sub has been the first time in my life I\u0019ve felt like I wasn\u0019t crazy for not wanting or believing in car-culture, and the first time I\u0019ve felt like there are others out there who question the cult of the car and value accessibility and public transit as equitable alternatives. \n\nI hope this sub can grow in visibility and perhaps generate resources for car-free alternatives in policy and life. \n\nFuck cars.",

      "text": "So as the title suggests I recently broke my ankle in a longboarding accident (stupid I know). It's my right foot so I can no longer drive which means I am immediately isolated. I can rely on DoorDash/uber and some people have been nice enough to offer rides around but still the loss of autonomy is kind of depressing. It's annoying that pro-car people always insist that cars are better for the disabled. Yeah, I am sure for some people with disabilities car centric society is a plus, but I think it harms just as many people as it helps. Blind people for example are harmed by car centric society. Not to mention the fact that even if someone's mobility is inhibited, driving from point a to point b does not solve the fact that they still cannot easily get around. Walking is still required in almost all aspects of car-centric society with the exception of drivethrus. You have to walk form the parking lot to the store. For example, if someone was paralyzed and needed an electric wheelchair, they need specialized van to transport their wheelchair and someone to drive for them if they cannot, whereas if they lived in a walkable neighborhood, they could simply use the electric wheelchair to get around. The addition of the vehicle is a hinderance not a benefit to these people. \n\nIf I lived in a place that was more walkable, I could take my crutches/scooter and at least go to a coffee shop or something to get some fresh air but instead I am shelled up in a suburban apartment and have to pay $21+ for an Uber to get anywhere. Instead of the disabled being integrated in modern society, car-centric infrastructure kind of shoves them to the wayside if they cannot drive, Especially if you are low income and unable to afford living in a walkable area.

This point is really dumb though because you can charge your EV over night at your home and you\u0019re probably much more likely to have more range with an EV at any given time, compared to a combustion car. Also, EVs don\u0019t use much power while idling in traffic (which would probably be the case if there is an emergency and EVERYONE is trying to leave)\n\nBack to the original point, what would places like, for example, the Netherlands, New York City, I guess some places in California, etc do if there is a disaster and they need to evacuate? Given that many of those evacuating do not have access to a vehicle.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the responses! Also, no, this is not something I believe, it was a point my mom made and I wanted to find a refutation. You know how these people are, they find one thing and stick to it as the whole argument despite there being 50 counter arguments. (Clarifying because I got two really rude messages lol)",

      "title": "The subject of cars and me not owning one came up in two of my lessons this week",
      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

      "title": "I\u0019m sick and tired of the same excuses drivers come up with to continue burning gasoline on a warming planet",
      "text": "Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:\n\n**\u001cMy emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d**\n\nThis is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth\u0019s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t afford an electric car.\u001d**\n\nNo one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There\u0019s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\u001d**\n\nYou *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dDriving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nCommute times should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cThere\u0019s no infrastructure to bike where I live.\u001d**\n\nAny road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThe infrastructure isn\u0019t ready yet.\u001d**\n\nWe don\u0019t have time: not only is our planet\u0019s climate destabilizing, it\u0019s destabilizing quickly. We can\u0019t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it\u0019s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.\n\n**\u001cMy workplace is out of reach of biking distance.\u001d**\n\nConsider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can\u0019t, then consider finding another job that\u0019s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn\u0019t be the priority when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI\u0019m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.\u001d**\n\nUnless you\u0019re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t carry my groceries on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThere\u0019s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t ride a bike in the cold.\u001d**\n\nWear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cNot everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThen go for an adult tricycle instead. Don\u0019t set that option aside so quickly when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThere wouldn\u0019t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.\u001d**\n\nIf more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet\u0019s climate from destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t like waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nBring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI don\u0019t like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d**\n\nComfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dHow can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\u001d**\n\nAre you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?\n\n**\u001dYour use of a device that\u0019s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we\u0019re focusing on.\n\n**\u001d[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.\n\nThe bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren\u0019t insignificant at all. You can\u0019t shift the blame on \u001ccorporations\u001d or \u001cinfrastructure\u001d when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.\n\nEDITS:\n\nIt turns out r/fuckcars has *way* more car apologists hiding among its members than one would expect!\n\nDrinking game!

On campus, they had blocked off a lot of the students from driving on the roads on campus, but there are still campus specific vehicles that traverse the area, so they should be trained to watch out for bicycles, pedestrians, and electric push scooters (which are super prevalent on campus). Well, while students were crossing at the cross walk, all the cars had stopped and it was a straight road with a curb, so no one should be turning. So I decide to cut in front on the right between the curb and 2 cars in front of me because they were at a stop and I cannot hurt anyone harshly on my bicycle. When I passed the cars, the cops (one of the cars) had come up to me once I had parked in front of my building and told me that \"You should not be passing because if we turned and hit you, it would be your fault.\" Mind you, this is supposed to be a 10 MPH or less zone.\r  \n1.)

      "text": "No matter the reason, whether it be pumping out oversized pickup trucks and SUVs, lying about the emissions of their vehicles, actively promoting a car-centric lifestyle, peddling to reactionaries to buy their pickups, shady and unethical business practices, etc. \n\nWhile all auto manufacturers (and most companies) are guilty of unethical practices, it's in the financial interests of the auto manufacturers to ensure a car-centric lifestyle so that people are dependent upon their produces. \n\nRegardless of your reasoning, let me know which auto manufacturer you dislike the most as I'll share you mine. Probably on the top of my list has to be Tesla. \n\nGoing off their products, the notion that battery-electric cars are environmentally friendly is laughable as \n\nA. Electric cars need lots of rare Earth minerals that are mined via slave child labor. \n\nB. Said mining practices are not only unethical but destructive to the environment. \n\nC. Cars are just inherently bad for the environment not just through direct emissions because they require a lot of space which means more forests have to be paved over for roads and parking lots, said surface parking lot creates the urban heat island effect, cars are inefficient and they don't last long mostly due to planned obsolescence, cars kill so many animals directly through road-kill, and cars kill thousands of people each year, and the \"self-driving\" feature of Tesla cars are flawed and shady.\n\nD. Tesla cars burst into flames.\n\nHowever, my primary reason for hating Telsa has to be Elon Musk. Rant warning: Elon Musk is a racist, white South \"African\" i.e settler who got rich off of his parents' emerald mine, has a fucking cult of stans who worship him like he's a God Emperor, and attacks anyone who questions their messiah, and turned Twitter (I refuse to call it X) into a cesspool of racist, reactionary content. He uses child labor in the lithium mines, abuses the workers in the Tesla factories, disregarding their safety, and is just a giant piece of shit. Fuck Elon Musk, Fuck his culty stans, and if anyone drives a Telsa car, note that they are complicit in child labor and exploitation and that they're giving money to a racist piece of shit.\n\n(I know there's no ethical consumption under our current system, but at least try to minimize the impact by not purchasing products from companies that openly practice unethical procedures).\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Tesla is number one on my list of most hated auto manufacturers with Ford being a close second for similar reasons as Henry Ford was an anti-Semitic piece of shit. Let me know what's number one on your list and your reasoning for that. Take care, and stay safe.",

On my free time, I would research highways in my country, road and urban design etc. but as this continued research progressed, I started to come across more and more ideas of infrastructure that was less dependent on cars, I luckily had an open mind and wanted to learn more, this sounded interesting to me.\n\nI began to look into it more, and then was introduced to the infamous Not Just Bikes channel and Strong Towns. My perspective started to change and I started to realize how the car dependent infrastructure around me, that I thought was the #1 way, was limiting to transportation and harmful to the environment and people unable to drive.\n\nAs of the beginning of summer 2022, I began taking advantage of the transit given, and I feel blessed living in an area of the U.S with most likely the best transit in the country. My family and friends are now more open to train travel because of me. I\u0019m going one step further and starting to take my suburban bus for the first time ever in my life, it feels great that I\u0019m making change. I will continue to be a transit advocate and opening minds to new ideas of how to live!!\n\nAs a bonus, here\u0019s a picture of receipts I\u0019ve collected since I\u0019ve started taking transit. (Not even including digital tickets ;) [I got this idea from u/keralawala to show tickets!]\n\nThank you all for your time and have a blessed and car free day &lt;3",

I literally wear ear foam plugs because the sound of cars, even a singular one, is so loud I can hear tinnitus forming. \n\nAir pollution? Started taking to wearing masks because of the gross exhaust and tire micro plastics/dust being kicked up. \n\nCatcalling? This shouldn\u0019t be that surprising , but as a woman you can not dress as nice if you are going somewhere without a car. Catcalling, stares, it just gets amplified by 100x. So I dress very modestly and usually wear baggy clothes if I take the bus. \n\n\nAnyways, I think I\u0019ve covered some of the basics on how to protect your health and your sanity from cars, but please let me know if you have more suggestions",

      "text": "I was hit by a car a few weeks ago while riding my bike home from work. The driver didn't see me because the sun was in his eyes. I'm taking him at his word with that; the sun was directly ahead and low in the sky at the time. That said, he was traveling 50km/hr when he hit me. My neck snapped back when I was hit and I broke my C6 vertebra. I went up over the bonnet and broke his windscreen with my bum which had a pretty severe impact trauma. I had gravel rash and bruising on my spine and tailbone from where I landed on the dirt at the side of the road. I'm back at work part time now, but have a neck brace on for a few more weeks, and can't drive, ride, or even pick up my daughter. My neck, glute and tailbone are still sore every day and I need to rest a lot. \n\nReading through the posts in this sub has given me much needed encouragement to get back out on my bike, once I've gotten my neck brace off and get the insurance money for a new bike (my old one was crumpled up). I am keen to not let this incident deter me from living the lifestyle that is good for my health, other road users, and the environment. But it is difficult when I think about how easily things could have been so much worse. I should be back to normal in a few months, but I shudder to think of what the result could have been. I ride with my 3 year old daughter in the bike trailer regularly, and if she had been behind me when I was hit she would have without a doubt been killed.\n\nI live in a regional town in Australia which is very car centric. There are some bike lanes, but there's no physical separation from cars, and the lanes are usually covered in gravel and glass. The bike lanes disappear and reappear in random places because the roads weren't actually designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI got my story in the local newspaper where I encouraged readers to consider how when a car and a cyclist collide, the cyclist is always worse off, and to slow down if conditions or visibility are poor. Hopefully the message got through to some people and drivers are more careful. Too few people are aware of how dangerous cars are. I am also a car driver and I believe I am a better, more aware driver because I also ride my bike.\n\nThanks again to this group for showing me the bright side of being a cyclist in a car-dominated world. I'm excited to get back on the road on my new bike - this time with more flashing lights and a big fuck off flag on the back.",

      "title": "On using people with disabilities as a reason to continue car dependence.",
      "text": "I have disabilities. And as someone with disabilities, I do not appreciate hearing, \"but, people with disabilities!\", which is often used by proponents of continued car dependence. I do not appreciate hearing that walkable/accessible cities are inherently \"ableist\".\n\nMy own situation is as follows: I have heat and exercise intolerance due to autonomic dysfunction. My blood pressure can drop suddenly if I overheat, causing me to faint. I also have vertebral dissections, which reduce how much blood reaches my brain. It also raises my stroke risk. The symptoms of this can be exacerbated by heat as well.\n\nDespite this, and how it means I cannot always walk or cycle places, especially with the heat waves in my area, I will **always** advocate for walkable/accessible cities.\n\nMy first beef with, \"but people with disabilities!\" is not every disability is the same. Disabilities are not homogeneous. There are varying needs. Yes, some people will **always** need to take a vehicle because of their limitations or health circumstances. Some people cannot transport themselves voluntarily, be it in a wheelchair or otherwise. Some people need to be in a climate-controlled environment because autonomic problems make it prohibitively hard to maintain their body temperature, especially in hot summer months or cold winters, as is often the case with me.\n\nHowever, is not *always* the case for me. It's not the case with many other people, either.\n\nFurthermore, it is disingenuous to claim that having a disability = needing to drive or use a car. Many people with disabilities cannot drive, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot walk, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot ride a bicycle, but can ride an ebike. Many people cannot walk, but can drive a scooter. Many people have ups and downs with their disabilities where they can sometimes function better or worse, so their abilities **fluctuate.**\n\nThis is not a one-size-fits-all situation. There is more nuance than that. The idea that car dependence is somehow a blanket solution is mired in a simplified, naïve presumption of what disability is, and isn't, and it's putting words in the mouths of everyone who has a disability.\n\nWe need to talk about the **economic burden** of personal vehicle ownership as well. Vehicle ownership is often touted as some kind of gold standard for PWD accommodation, but the reality is, many people with disabilities require DME (durable medical equipment). These devices include, among others: small daily living aids, ambulatory aids like canes and crutches, bathroom aids, special beds and bedding, scooters, wheelchairs, ventilators, oxygen therapy, lifts, hearing aids, etc. These can be very costly. I have a piece of DME that recently cost me $1,400 to purchase. Some people need costly medication too.\n\nThis creates a financial burden, which only worsens if someone cannot work because of their disabilities, or if they otherwise need to work less than is economically viable. Disability assistance does exist, but it doesn't even come **close** to covering the cost of housing, unless you're crammed into a place with multiple roommates. This is effectively hidden homelessness.\n\nIn Vancouver, a generally walkable city, the baseline PWD payment for a single person is under $1,500. The average rent for an unfurnished, one-bedroom apartment is over [$2,300.](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/vancouver-rent-prices-july-2023-7262184)\n\nAnd forget covering all the other costs.\n\nIf you can't do that, you are forced into the suburbs.\n\nBut unfortunately, despite the decrease in housing costs in the suburbs, owning a personal vehicle generally still means you're paying a **ton.** Vehicles take a massive chunk out of someone's earnings, often hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, according to Stefan Gossling's oft-cited [study.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003943) Personal vehicles make it even harder for someone with a disability to get ahead, forcing them to merely subsist.\n\nCompulsory personal vehicle ownership, as a result of car dependence, is often accompanied by sprawl as well. This creates an overabundance of suburban areas and roads that may not even have sidewalks. Due to potentially reduced income, people with disabilities often need to live in suburban areas, as opposed to city centers, which often have higher housing costs. If someone with a disability lives in a suburban area, and they cannot get around without a car, they need to remain at home unless they have someone to drive them around. This chauffeuring needs to fit both peoples' schedules. For many people, this vastly reduced opportunity for casual and spontaneous interaction can be very isolating, and lead to mental health deficits.\n\nEven if someone is capable of getting around by themselves, whether because they are ambulatory or have a wheelchair or other mobility device, it may not be feasible for them to venture from home. For example, if someone is visually impaired and cannot drive, but can still get around by walking, they still may not be able to leave their suburbs unless they walk a **very long** distance, for a long time - and unless they are willing to compromise their safety. Many newly-developed suburbs do not even have sidewalks. This makes independent living prohibitive for many people.\n\nCar-dependence proponents will often claim if someone has a disability and cannot drive, they can just get someone to drive them places. This is not possible in many cases. Not everyone has relatives or friends on standby to drive them places. Some people have not been able to make social connections because of their disability. Some people may have a connection or two, but the connection is too far away (which is often due to sprawl, and how isolated different neighborhoods can be) to provide reliable service. The very idea is rooted in ableism and naïve thinking.\n\nBut let's imagine a scenario where someone, in spite of the lack of sidewalks in their neighborhood, decides to go to a store. Because of car dependence, they will be exposed to noise pollution, which is known to inappropriately arouse and harm the sympathetic nervous system, as documented [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) and [here.](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8f98-tph-How-Loud-is-Too-Loud-Health-Impacts-Environmental-Noise.pdf) This is especially stressful for people with sensory issues, such as autism and even PTSD. They will be exposed to road pollution, which also negatively impacts health, as documented [here,](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/sc-hc/H144-91-2022-eng.pdf) [here,](https://archive.li/xIyBP) and [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855107/) Due to hostile road designs resulting from car dependence, they will also be [especially vulnerable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) to traffic violence.\n\n**And here's a stark reality:** car violence causes an untold number of disabilities in previously able-bodied people. Many people become disabled because vehicles strike them while driving way too fast to be safe, when in reality, those vehicles should be going very, very slowly anywhere that pedestrians and vehicles mix. But this is conveniently ignored by proponents of car dependence. In addition, many able-bodied people will experience an injury or disability at some point in their lives, for some reason or another, and it may prevent them from driving.\n\nI know multiple people who have sprained ankles and needed crutches. What happens if their right foot is seriously injured?\n\nMore pressingly, why are these scenarios always *totally overlooked* by proponents of car dependence? (Don't answer that. It was [rhetorical.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias))\n\nReducing dependence on personal vehicles means roads will require less frequent maintenance. This means more funds will be available for sidewalks, so more areas can actually get sidewalks in the first place, and the existing sidewalks can be widened/improved so people in wheelchairs, on crutches, and so on don't need to play hopscotch on broken (or incomplete) concrete to get around. Or, people can use personal mobility lanes if they don't want to go *bump-bump-bump* over sidewalk cracks. Not only will sidewalks and mobility lanes have more funding, but it will allow a city to spend more money on accessibility amenities, including benches, shady structures, large trees, cooling stations, water fountains, and public washrooms, which everyone in a community can use.\n\nLess roads also means there will be less asphalt to absorb heat. This can lower the overall ambient temperature, reducing the effect of [heat islands.](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/articles/pavement_thermal.cfm) There are a few videos out there of people cooking eggs on sidewalks - asphalt retains [even more heat](https://www.forconstructionpros.com/concrete/article/22210872/igga-international-grooving-grinding-association-study-on-concrete-pavement-factor-in-urban-heat-island-uhi-effect) due to the darker material. Vegetation, and the shade created by it, also helps reduce ambient temperature.\n\nWhen streets are designed for people first, and safety first, it will also reduce the chances of vehicle-related accidents. The overall noise levels will become quieter, both ambient tire noise and honking, making it more pleasant for people with sensory issues to move around outside. Noise-cancelling headphones may not be as necessary. Visually impaired people would not be subjected to victim-blaming tips like \"watch for turning drivers\", when they often literally *cannot* watch for them, as there would be more emphasis on driver caution, and better prophylactic street safety features, instead of pedestrian caution.\n\nThe logistics of driving for people with disabilities will **also** improve. In a less car-dependent place, someone with a disability will not need to compete with able-bodied people over parking, and thus, they (or the person driving them) won't need to stress out about it. Parking will be easier to find. Since there will be less drivers on the road, there will be a lower chance of someone parking in the disabled parking spot at businesses when they shouldn't have.\n\nIt's just **less stressful.** There will be less hypotheticals, and less contingency planning that needs to be done in the realm of transporting oneself. To me, this feels liberating. Due to my disabilities, I always need to think three steps ahead to plan for unexpected things. Car dependence adds another layer of \"what if\" to that. Finding a parking spot, timed parking limits, payment, accidents on the way (I have been rear-ended in standstill traffic before), etc.\n\nThis isn't the only thing car dependence adds in a negative way.\n\nAs someone with disabilities, I feel that my life and daily activities are restricted by default, simply by merit of my disability existing. Proponents of car dependence are not allies. And they are not doing people with disabilities any favours by insisting that car dependence, aka the continued neglect of our **personal choice** on how to transport ourselves around, is the way forward. That just adds additional restrictions. It removes an element of agency that doesn't need to be absent in the first place. That isn't right.\n\nThere needs to be a choice at minimum. Right now, there isn't a choice in far, far too many places.\n\n**All of that said:**\n\nI do have concerns and fears about accessible city implementation, as do others. These concerns are not unfounded. New infrastructure can completely miss the mark on ADA/ADA compliance. Buses can lack air conditioning (this is a **major** issue for me in Vancouver). Many older buildings are walkups and do not have lifts, making them inaccessible to people who use mobility devices. Some public transport centers do not have elevators within reasonable distance to stairs, forcing people with mobility devices to detour extensively, soaking up time. Many bus stops lack both shelter/shade and benches, so I need to sit on the ground. And I am constantly bothered by how few public washrooms there are for people with gastrointestinal issues. It is degrading to need to enter a random Starbucks and silently head to the washroom, because the duty of providing such a basic amenity has been shunted off to nearby businesses (usually because a municipality refuses to fund the regular maintenance of facilities like this).\n\n**However,** these implementation problems do not make the notion of an accessible/walkable city inherently ableist in itself. The problem is with the **implementation** and the allocation of resources toward fixing the flaws, not the concept. It is manipulative to insist the opposite is true, and therefore that accessible/walkable cities should not exist.\n\nI will not say, \"but the buses are unbearably hot, therefore, I hate accessible/walkable cities\".\n\nI will say, \"fix the fucking buses, I have places to go without a car\".",

      "text": "\"Over the past decade, there has been a series of studies that attribute obesity and its related illnesses directly to the automotive lifestyle and, better yet, to the automotive landscape. One effort found that for every additional five minutes Atlanta-area residents drove each day, they were 3 percent more likely to be obese. Another showed that drivers who switch to public transit drop an average of five pounds. A third, in San Diego, reported that 60 percent of residents in a \u001clow-walkable\u001d neighborhood were overweight, compared to only 35 percent in a \u001chigh-walkable\u001d neighborhood. Another Atlanta study found that \u001cthe proportion of obese white males declined from 23 percent to 13 percent as neighborhood residential density increased from less than two to more than eight dwellings per acre.\u001d These are careful academic studies that control for age, income, and the other factors that correlate with body mass.\" \n\n\"I am wary of confusing causality with correlation, and it would be fair to say that heavier people are probably more likely to prefer driving over walking, and are therefore also more likely to prefer sprawl over urban neighborhoods. It is theoretically possible that, rather than suburbs making people fat, fat people make suburbs.

My mates have had experiences like this too, and they agree that socialization isnt really possible, especially within large stroad areas.

      "text": "I rarely ride in cars (just a few times a year), but when I do ride with friends/family I am sometimes terrified at their scary bad driving. Maybe I'm getting more sensitive because I don't use cars much any more, but maybe it's because I live in a city where the driving can be chaotic. I'm getting to the point of politely turning down rides when they're offered and using Lyft instead. Anyone else? Or does anyone eschew cars completely, and just never ride in them at all?\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the points of view. Years ago I remember reading about people who simply do not ride in cars, because of how damaging they are to society, communities, and the environment, but I can\u0019t find them online any more. It\u0019s interesting that in a sub dedicated to not liking cars so many of us do continue to use them, if rarely. I get that it\u0019s complicated, though, especially in areas developed around cars, like most of the US.\n\nAs I say, I rarely ride with folks, and ride even less because yes: my friends and family are scary drivers\u0014driving aggressively, driving after drinking too much, texting while driving, or driving while 85 (\u001cI\u0019m fine!\u001d). If a Lyft driver is ever bad, at least I know he is less likely to react with anger if I ask for something like slower/less reckless driving, unlike friends and family who have reacted with anger and driving even faster, and one who swung the steering wheel back and forth at high speed (I thought we were going to flip over), saying, \u001cSSSS-car-go is afraid I\u0019ll drive like this.\u001d\n\n\nEdit2: It turns out my concern/fear of being a passenger in a car with a bad/distracted driver is not all that unusual, and there is actually a campaign to encourage passengers to speak up if someone is driving poorly, or just not ride with them (get out safely). There\u0019s even a National Passenger Safety Week! https://nationalpassengersafety.org/ That definitely makes me feel less like a weirdo and more like someone who wants to avoid dying in a car. (During my last ride, with an elderly relative who was driving scary fast/reckless, I calmly reminded her that I was not comfortable driving fast and her response was to suggest I close my eyes! So I got out at our next stop and took Lyft (5-star) from there. I hope she was not offended, but 85 is too old to be driving, on highways anyway.)",

      "title": "Why do people complain about noise from a train when a new metro line opens, but don't bat an eye at the huge amount of noise that cars and highways generate?",
      "text": "Hello there, I hope you're doing well! Recently the Réseau Express Métropolitain (REM) opened in Montréal, Québec Canada. For the most part, it has been received positively and I hope to be able to ride it one day. But as with any transit project, some residents justified or not, (mostly not) complain about it. I'll be focusing on the issue of noise as that seems to be the main complaint of these residents.\n\nWhile it's true that during normal operations, trains do produce noise and everything should be done to minimize the noise they produced, what I don't understand is why these residents (I'm calling them NIMBYs and I don't care) complain about the noise produced by a train, but yet are silent when it comes to the greater amount of noise produced by cars, roads, and highways?\n\nMy grandma's house is next to a road and the cars are noisy, with that whooshing sound produced by rudder tires on asphalt, not to mention the jerks who speed by with their mufflers removed. Yet when the freight or commuter train passes by, I barely hear it. Keep in mind these freight trains are \"noisy\" diesels but since they don't horn (unless it's an emergency) at the level crossing, I barely hear them.\n\nIf these people are concerned about noise and infrastructure that quite literally cut their communities in two, they should protest highways as they produce more noise, are impossible/dangerous to cross on foot, and cut the community in half. Not to mention that in the United States, they bulldozed predominantly African American communities to build the interstate highway. If you want to talk about something that cuts your community in half, talk about highways. \n\nAt least with an elevated metro like the REM in Montréal and the SkyTrain in Vancouver you can I don't know, walk underneath it? You don't have to deal with level crossings or risk getting hit by a train as they're fully grade separated. Not to mention these transit agencies are doing their part in reducing noise by adding sound barriers along the track, etc. Generally, it's easier to reduce noise from a train than from cars, not to mention that electric trains are relatively silent whereas you have jerks in cars driving around with their mufflers removed, purposely producing noise that irritates everyone.\n\nSorry for the rant, I don't mean to antagonize these residents as we *should* try to reduce noise from trains are much as possible. But what annoys me is how these people seem to ignore the giant elephant in the room as cars produce way more noise and are more destructive to the environment than trains. And as Jason from NotJustBikes says, \"Cities aren't loud, cars are!\"\n\nPS: I know some people rightfully complain about the noise highways generate, but for the most part people only complain about a new metro line while not batting an eye at cars. Consistency people?!\n\nAnyways, here's some info about the REM and I hope I get to ride it one day\n\n[https://rem.info/en/noise-vibration-operation](https://rem.info/en/noise-vibration-operation)\n\n[https://rem.info/en](https://rem.info/en)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9O6RzsXIqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9O6RzsXIqQ)",

I truly came to the realisation about what had felt \"wrong\" all my life.\n\nAt that point I felt guilty for driving, especially since I live within a cycling distance of most places I go, and can take the train to work and Uni.\n\nSo I started experimenting.\n\nI got a bike for cheap from a police auction, and started cycling as much as I could for local journeys, I started taking the train (35 min journey) to go to Uni once a week.\n\nAnd I loved it, more than I ever liked driving.\n\nMy car became extremely disused, I used it twice in the last 3 months. So I've now sold it.\n\nWhich is even better, no longer am I having to sink money into an expensive commodity that makes me miserable and is shit for the environment, instead I can save the money from the sale and from maintenance/fuel/insurance etc towards my longer term goals.\n\nFor context, before taking the \"orange pill\" I used to drive everywhere...\n\n12 miles to work. \n\nTo the swimming pool just 2 miles away\n\nTo the shop **less than a mile away.**\n\nI fantasised about owning an electric car and doing \"my part\" for the environment, not even considering the irony about how consuming more isn't how you solve climate change.\n\nNow though, I cycle those first two without issue, and take the train to work and get to enjoy a nice 10 minute walk before/after work to get to the station now rather than sitting in soul crushing traffic.\n\nSo yeah, this subreddit works, at least for those of us willing to listen.\n\n*(I get that my situation won't apply to everyone - I live in a larger town in the UK that has a train station with connections to most nearby towns/cities, is fairly dense and I feel safe enough cycling around due to most roads being 30mph or less, and there are some cycle paths - if you can't do anything apart from drive though, don't give up, stay angry!

I hope enough folks in parliament will defend this. Let's pour all those dollars into public and active transport infrastructure! Who needs more highways when you can take a bus or train that gets you there just as fast (plus no expensive insurance)?\n\nProblem: North American cities are built around the car. If there's a single pot of dollars from which investment is pulled, such that funding for public/active transport networks means less for auto infrastructure... How do we move forward in a way that won't cause revolt?\n\nInfrastructure takes time to build. There will necessarily be a period of time where auto infrastructure is neglected but the public/active isn't yet strong enough to be a desirable alternative (especially for people living in suburbs). IMO, we need an influx of dollars to establish a strong alternative before we pull funding for auto infrastructure so folks care less.\n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "A short while ago I was in an argument with someone saying how high speed rail is not economically viable because American cities are built for the car and if you want to travel long distance, it's much cheaper to take a plane ticket than a train ticket.\n\nArguing aside, my main concern was what will happen when easily accessible fuels will all but disappear. There are other methods to extract and refine oil from places but they're much more expensive. There are also biofuels but a lot of farmland of corn needs to be diverted to the production of said biofuels. Corn is used for the production of foods and feeding livestock. Diverting a huge amount of that produced corn for fuel would make the food market price absolutely skyrocket.\n\nSo I suggested that we make towns more efficient with how they're planned, provide more affordable and dense housing, provide good inner city public transit, provide reasonable alternatives to driving cars and provide people with high speed rail between major cities. We should save the cheaper, more easily extractable fuels for other purposes as well as greatly reduce its consumption and thus, reduce impact on the environment\n\nThey began parroting how it's not economical to do that and I asked what is their plan for such fuels run out. \"We will eventually figure out a solution\".\n\nSo is that it? You want to delay fixing a very serious and KNOWN problem that can very well potentially devastate many things about life as we know it, all in the hopes that someone intelligent will come along and fix this problem. That whose fix we've already known about for decades and basically solved but you still deny its implementations because It wON't bE eCOnoMicAL. You could bulldoze apartments and businesses for car infrastructure and single family housing but you can't picture doing so again to revert the now well known and studied mistakes in modern society. \n\nIt's likely that the person just doesn't care because they'll be very old or dead so they don't have to deal with the consequences. Meanwhile here I am dealing with 30-40 degree summers and dying, and my town's renovating roads and building more free parking instead of planting tree shade.",

      "title": "American men have got to do better. Lack of public safety is driving American car culture. ",
      "text": "So first off, trigger warning for rape and sexual assault.\n\nHey folks, I\u0019ve been thinking about American car culture a lot lately, and I think one of the big things driving it is actually women. What do I mean by this? I mean that American women do not feel safe on public transportation, or really safe in public in general, because of the poor behavior of American men. I think back to female friends and girlfriends I\u0019ve had, and how many of them preferred to drive rather than walk or take the bus/train. I also recall a lot of them telling me that they would never take the train or the bus unless a man was with them. \n\nMany of my ex girlfriends, about half of them, were rape or sexual assault survivors. Heck, my wife is a rape survivor. Now, I recognize that this is anecdotal, but it is insane to me that out of the 12 women I have dated in my life, HALF of them were raped or sexually assaulted. That makes me really ashamed of American men. It\u0019s no wonder American women feel so unsafe all the time, we have to do better. \n\nNow, on to public transportation. In my local area it\u0019s actually not too bad, there\u0019s a train station about half an hour from my house (on foot) and there\u0019s a bus stop at the end of my block. In addition, my neighborhood is surprisingly walkable, there\u0019s a supermarket and a little shopping center that\u0019s only a 20 minute walk from my house. \n\nHowever, I very rarely take advantage of any of this stuff anymore, and my wife never does, unless I\u0019m with her, and even then she prefers to drive. Why? Well, at the train station a guy was jumped during rush hour and was robbed and beaten half to death, a few months later a guy was murdered at that train station. There\u0019s also problems with people smoking fentanyl and other illegal substances on the trains and buses. I\u0019ve seen that with my own eyes multiple times. In addition, if I walk through my neighborhood to the supermarket the chances that I\u0019ll have an unpleasant social interaction are surprisingly high. \n\nA few months ago I walked to the supermarket to get some groceries and on my way back a group of three teenage boys approached me and started trying to intimidate me and basically provoke me into fighting them. It was a scary, uncomfortable experience for me, and I haven\u0019t walked to the store since, now I just drive. I\u0019m a big dude, I\u0019m six foot three, but I\u0019ve had two brain surgeries. One punch to the head and I\u0019m probably done for. I\u0019ve also thought about what my wife would\u0019ve done in that position. She\u0019s a tiny woman, only four foot ten, and she only weighs 90 pounds. She almost certainly would\u0019ve maced those three boys. This is just one example, I\u0019ve had many negative experiences like this just walking around my neighborhood. \n\nNow, what\u0019s my point with all this? I used to live in Japan, when I was over there I didn\u0019t even own a car, I always walked or used public transportation. However, the entire time I lived there I can only think of one time that I felt unsafe. Obviously things are not perfect over there, but in general they do a much better job with public safety than we do over here in the U.S.\n\nWe can do better, if we want people to abandon car culture we need to really lean into public safety. Create a safe environment for people to live without cars and I think many more will do so. Anyway, I\u0019m curious to hear your thoughts, what can we do about this?\n\n\n",

The ridiculously high level of danger in their method of transportation, the cost of gas and maintenance, and the effect on the environment. \nI never met anyone who shared my views and I was so surprised when I stumbled upon this sub. Guess there really are people that have the same sort of views as you if you really look. \n\nI've been in two car accidents that landed me in the hospital. One when I was 9, got me 4 days in the ICU, 26 more days in a normal hospital, and 8 painful surgeries to reconstruct my arm after half of my skin was pulled off in the accident. The second one at 19. I was going about 40mph in the rain, lost control and was ejected from my car, hitting the ground so hard I tore the soles off my boots and busted several vertebrae in my spine. 12 day hospital stay, 1 surgery. \n\nThose experiences left me with nearly crippling driving anxiety.  I have to force myself to drive anyways because I have no other options, and it's always a terrible and stressful experience. It kicks in mostly when I'm on the freeway surrounded by 8 lanes of speeding traffic moving at 70-90mph.\n\n I've seen how quickly you can go from comfortable cruising along to being within inches of life, because I lived it. People called me negative when I talked about the unnecessary dangers of car travel because they didn't live this experience. \n\nWhen I was younger, I read a book called Uglies by Scott westerfield IIRC. It was set in a post collapse dystopia society that had hover technology, and the kids often used old dilapidated railways to ride their hoverboards, as the boards relied on magnetic force to move. I always wished since I read that book that we could have magnetically powered travel like that!! I couldn't understand with how advanced our technology was, and how they curated newer and fancier phones and devices all the time, we couldn't have safer alternatives to car travel. \n\nI'm rambling a bit, but yeah I'm just excited to find this sub!!!

      "text": "Disclaimer: Before you say anything, I along with many people acknowledge the harm that suburban sprawl does to the environment and our psychology and advocate for us to move away from the suburban experiment. So don't shoot the messenger here.\n\n[https://theowp.org/reports/the-detrimental-impact-of-suburban-sprawl-on-the-environment/#comments](https://theowp.org/reports/the-detrimental-impact-of-suburban-sprawl-on-the-environment/#comments)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s19okTYl8MA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s19okTYl8MA)\n\nWith that being said, I would just like to share an interesting phenomenon I noticed while riding the SkyTrain in British Columbia, Canada, namely the locations of stations like 22nd Street, 29th Avenue, and Nanaimo station. With many metro systems, their stations are located in dense areas with many amenities nearby whether that be shops, restaurants, apartments, etc. Because of that, for many people in suburban and rural areas, the only reliable way to get around is via personal automobile. However, an interesting quirk of the SkyTrain system is where 22nd St, 29th Ave, and Nanaimo stations are located.\n\nWhile most SkyTrain stations have development around them, the aforementioned stations are located in sprawling, lower-density, North American-style suburbs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[22nd Street Station](https://preview.redd.it/4659yj5b6jqb1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949596c2aabb83e397b9a629b18bdbccaa78d59c)\n\n \n\n[22nd Street Station](https://preview.redd.it/5m7z6w1t6jqb1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a8a7ba35e67cd6acab1421d3cc3b43b536a74ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[29th Ave and Nanaimo Station](https://preview.redd.it/y8dozbwz6jqb1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a55ac504ce7148f2fc6997c6c352731665859a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nanaimo Station](https://preview.redd.it/ujm24r837jqb1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91c02d8ac89129925f1c6b21749bcaa3d7f5f866)\n\nIt's interesting to see the tracks of the SkyTrain going through some pretty old suburbs as that is a rare sight to see with other metro systems. While most residents living near these stations still own cars, I doubt they would use them as much as someone living in a fully car-dependent suburb as it's probably easier and faster to take the SkyTrain to downtown and other places. At the very least, by taking the SkyTrain, they don't have to pay for parking in downtown Vancouver. Also, I remember seeing some teenage boys boarding the SkyTrain at Metrotown with Bubble Tea drinks, and exiting at 29th Ave. I assume they live in the neighborhood near 29th Ave station and took the SkyTrain to go to the mall. Talk about independence for teens.\n\nI acknowledge that suburban sprawl is not great for the environment and isn't great for other factors as we should move away from it. But I thought it would be interesting to share this quirk with the SkyTrain on how some stations are located in suburban sprawl with the tracks quite literally in someone's backyard. I know buses and even trams might go to the suburbs, but a fully grade-separated, third-rail-powered metro is a rare sight to see, at least in North America. \n\nI know that in places like China, they have special \"suburban\" metro trains that are larger, run up to 160 km/h, and serve suburban areas with large distances between stations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00gxw5x6noqb1.jpg?width=4387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db376004de7be5803907fc28965fe56a6fbd2528\n\nBut share with me some interesting quirks and locations of metro stations in your area, because an actual metro in a sprawling suburb is an interesting phenomenon.",

      "text": "One of the great ironies of National Parks in North America, namely in Canada and the US is that they're only reliably accessible by personal automobile. I shouldn't have to tell you how terrible cars are for animals and the environment. There's the direct consequences like collisions (roadkill), road noise, tire particles, constant traffic, habitat loss resulting from just how much space cars, roads, highways, and parking lots take up. \n\nCars kill thousands of people each year, and millions of animals, if it's unsafe for people to cross a highway, it's definitely unsafe for animals to cross. Even though some of the highways crossing through forests have these wildlife crossing bridges, these bridges wouldn't have to exist if it weren't for cars and highways cutting the forest in half!\n\n[This wouldn't need to exist if it weren't for cars!](https://preview.redd.it/n58xou3vzjad1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e25d71d8079d66cd8829efa3acb3e9a7e4d53a4)\n\nThen there's the indirect consequences like air pollution both local and global, cars encouraging sprawling suburbs, mining and extracting resources like oil, metal, etc for the production and maintenance of cars, imperialism, invasions, and wars for said resources \\*cough\\* \\*cough\\* US invasion of Iraq, exploitative labor practices and literal child slaves for lithium mining for battery electrics cars! I could go on about how terrible cars are both physically, environmentally, and socially, but I'll focus on the irony on how many National Parks are only accessible by car.\n\nIt's ironic how the only way to \"experience true nature\" is for someone to hop into a usually gas-guzzling car, drive it down a highway that cuts the forest in half, only to [mow down a rare white brown bear and her cubs in the process](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/). Needless to say, f\\*ck cars, and especially f\\*ck them if they're used to drive through a National Park. And the gall of calling these parks \"protected lands\" while allowing cars to drive through them?! If you want to protect land, prohibit cars from driving there!\n\nOne of the biggest threats facing animals in natural areas isn't human hunters, poachers, or invasive species, but cars! Cars both directly and indirectly are the biggest killers of animals, and it's a shame that most National Parks are only accessible by cars, the biggest threat to animals.\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nI'm not saying that there shouldn't be parks for people to visit as people just walking on trails and such do not greatly disturb wildlife. However, driving there in a car shouldn't be the only option if an option at all. \n\nWhile there are unfortunately collisions between trains on ground level tracks and animals, the number of \"roadkill\" is significantly lower than with cars and measures can be taken to prevent this. As to why train collisions with animals are lower? Firstly, railway tracks do not take up a lot of space compared to a highway. All you need for a railway to be efficient is a double track, and even with larger North American loading gauges, at most all you need is about 7.5 meters width, the equivalent of two highways lanes (correct me if I'm wrong about North American train loading gauges).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kemivdb9ckad1.jpg?width=509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ec593632f618091cb65e04c75c7076bc78b5e8\n\nSecondly, even a frequent railway line with trains every ten minutes is nowhere near the constant, never-ending traffic of a highway. With trains every ten minutes or longer, it allows for animals to cross.\n\nAnd thirdly, it seems like animals are just better adapted around trains than with cars. Rather than worrying about dozens of cars when trying to cross a highway, they only have to deal with one train on tracks that take up less space, meaning there's lower risk when crossing. We've all seen birds and such hang out around train tracks without issue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbdkl9liakad1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b99d181006d8cbcf13c7ee5e21f2c7e0c257e46\n\nNow, in the unfortunately [story with the rare white brown bear](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/), if I read the article correctly, the mother was grazing in the ditch near the train tracks. Now when the metal wheels screeched against the rails, it startled her, I mean who wouldn't get startled by train wheels screeching, I would as trains are relatively quiet except for wheel screech. The startled mother bear unfortunately ran up from the ditch and onto the highway where she was struck and killed.\n\n\"It's the train that scared her onto the highway! If it weren't for the train, she wouldn't have gotten struck!\" A car brain would say. Keep in mind that the bear knew to stay off the train tracks, and that it was the car that made the killing blow. If the highway wasn't there and the bear did got startled, she would've gone back to the ditch and continue on grazing. Not to mention cars kill animals regardless if there's a train track nearby or not. The train didn't kill her, the cars did!\n\nNow, one way to mitigate the impacts that railways have in an forested area, at least once construction is complete is to have the tracks elevated on viaducts as it allows for the train to be fully grade separated while allowing for animals to cross underneath.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4htsj1agakad1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a6cd178cbbf672fd3d4dc89d8d9a0c5197fed3\n\nWhile all human activity does impact wildlife, having elevated railways probably has the lowest impact as once construction is complete, it doesn't cut the forest in half like a surface highway for the elevated tracks allows for animals to cross beneath it safely without having to worry about getting struck.\n\nIt's a shame that most National Parks in North America are only accessible by car, the worst mode of transport for animals' wellbeing due to how many animals cars kill. To preserve our National Parks, we have to restrict cars from entering them due to said negative effects. At best, have elevate trains to them. At the bear minimum, use buses that can take a good 50-100 cars off the road.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yko469ebbkad1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc60d6a7661254b040e5f360fed1bae291a08283\n\nBy limiting and/or prohibiting cars from driving through National Parks can we preserve and truly enjoy the wonders of the natural world.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uhyaujlbkad1.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c06d21a44a3e5a9f173e3781fe668a9fa32b7ba\n\n",

      "text": "When I read arguers on this sub, 90% of them are reacting to the perceived extremism of the movement. They see that it's Fuck Cars and they think, \"but how would I do without a car in XYZ situation without a car?\" and they get you into a rabbit hole about solving some technical problem that would occur if we removed all cars from the road.\n\nStop yourself from getting into that conversation.\n\nThe most important part of the anti-car movement is this: A little bit of a good thing *is still good.*\n\nWe don't need to argue about how a 100% car-free would work. Maybe it won't work. Whatever. That's just a hypothetical world right now.\n\nPro-car people know that cars are dangerous, they pollute, they take up space, they are inefficient and expensive and force our cities into sprawl and prevent small businesses. These are facts. So instead of arguing about how to remove *all* cars, emphasize these facts and ask them to try to remove *one* car from the road.\n\nDoes your family own 3 cars? Could you maybe do without one? Could you carpool more often instead of each person taking their own? Maybe one person could take the bike sometimes? Most families could do with 2 instead of 3.\n\nDo you commute with a big truck? Could you maybe drive a smaller car instead? What about a moped?\n\nLet's talk about adding bike lanes in your city. Let's talk about expanding sidewalks. Let's slow down traffic along main street so walking is safer and more pleasant. Let's make as much progress as we can.\n\n\"But what about rural areas?\" Doesn't matter. Maybe we can only remove cars from cities. That would be a HUGE success. Focus on that. But maybe your small town could be accessed by bike instead of car? Wouldn't your small town main street be better if it was walkable?\n\n\"But what about trucking?\" Doesn't matter. Maybe hauling cargo by truck is irreplaceable. Even if all we did was remove personal vehicles it would be a huge success. But could we do *more* cargo by train instead?\n\n\"But I hang sheetrock for my job so I need a truck!\" Ok, fine. But the vast majority of people don't, so let's get those people using trains and bikes and you can keep your truck.\n\nIf you are coming onto this sub to argue, you need to address the main point, the main problem: our roads and streets in North America are designed for the car and for the car only, and people are given no choice but to drive for transportation. Cars fill our public places. They are dangerous, unhealthy, expensive, destructive to the environment, and they force themselves into our lives.\n\nThe majority of people in Europe and America live in or adjacent to a city, commute a few miles every day, go grocery shopping a few miles every day, all by car. The vast majority of this travel could be replaced by biking and transit *if our world was designed better.* If we build locations close to where people live, build great transit and bike infrastructure, and allowed more dense housing and commercial buildings, this would work for the vast majority of humans and would remove the need for the vast majority of driving.\n\nIf you're here to argue, then address the main argument, not century-later hypotheticals. Explain why you think it's good that the majority of people drive to work and live far away from their jobs and their grocery stores, and public transit is poorly maintained or non-existent. Talk about the expense of car infrastructure, automobile deaths, traffic, and parking.\n\nFor the fuckcars supporters, keep on talking about how to make that perfect 100% car-free world. But don't let perfect be the enemy of good.",

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

Even though car dependency is still the dominant urban planning philosophy in the US, the Internet allows us to see and discuss how cities are built in Europe and Asia and compare them to US cities. International travel is also more accessible than it has ever been, so people can see the benefits of walkable, people-oriented cities for themselves.\n\nThis final point is mostly intangible, but I can feel a desire among my generation (gen Z) to avoid the isolated, cookie-cutter lifestyle of living in a big house in the suburbs with a white picket fence and driving everywhere.",

      "text": "This post is inspired by one I'm not going to link where a group of protesters are blocking a road and a cop decides to ram his car through the crowd, running over several people. Though there are a handful of comments condemning this, the most highly upvoted ones are all supportive of the cop's actions. Sentiments expressed include how the protesters \"F\\*\\*\\*ed around and found out,\" that they \"shouldn't have been on the road,\" and \"That's what I would have done if my car was surrounded.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that the perpetrator was a cop adds another whole dynamic on top of this. But I notice the same phenomenon among normal people who aren't otherwise prone to violence. I can understand why people who travel exclusively by car would want the roads to be exclusively for cars and don't like when people inconvenience them. Selfishness, while not one of humanity's best impulses, is one that I can at least comprehend. But I'm shocked by just how many drivers think the appropriate response to being inconvenienced is attempted murder.  \n\n\nIt really seems like when people are driving they are thinking about their environment on a different scale, and any person not in a car no longer registers as significant enough to care about. But I'm curious if there are any real studies on this phenomenon?",

      "text": "No matter the reason, whether it be pumping out oversized pickup trucks and SUVs, lying about the emissions of their vehicles, actively promoting a car-centric lifestyle, peddling to reactionaries to buy their pickups, shady and unethical business practices, etc. \n\nWhile all auto manufacturers (and most companies) are guilty of unethical practices, it's in the financial interests of the auto manufacturers to ensure a car-centric lifestyle so that people are dependent upon their produces. \n\nRegardless of your reasoning, let me know which auto manufacturer you dislike the most as I'll share you mine. Probably on the top of my list has to be Tesla. \n\nGoing off their products, the notion that battery-electric cars are environmentally friendly is laughable as \n\nA. Electric cars need lots of rare Earth minerals that are mined via slave child labor. \n\nB. Said mining practices are not only unethical but destructive to the environment. \n\nC. Cars are just inherently bad for the environment not just through direct emissions because they require a lot of space which means more forests have to be paved over for roads and parking lots, said surface parking lot creates the urban heat island effect, cars are inefficient and they don't last long mostly due to planned obsolescence, cars kill so many animals directly through road-kill, and cars kill thousands of people each year, and the \"self-driving\" feature of Tesla cars are flawed and shady.\n\nD. Tesla cars burst into flames.\n\nHowever, my primary reason for hating Telsa has to be Elon Musk. Rant warning: Elon Musk is a racist, white South \"African\" i.e settler who got rich off of his parents' emerald mine, has a fucking cult of stans who worship him like he's a God Emperor, and attacks anyone who questions their messiah, and turned Twitter (I refuse to call it X) into a cesspool of racist, reactionary content. He uses child labor in the lithium mines, abuses the workers in the Tesla factories, disregarding their safety, and is just a giant piece of shit. Fuck Elon Musk, Fuck his culty stans, and if anyone drives a Telsa car, note that they are complicit in child labor and exploitation and that they're giving money to a racist piece of shit.\n\n(I know there's no ethical consumption under our current system, but at least try to minimize the impact by not purchasing products from companies that openly practice unethical procedures).\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Tesla is number one on my list of most hated auto manufacturers with Ford being a close second for similar reasons as Henry Ford was an anti-Semitic piece of shit. Let me know what's number one on your list and your reasoning for that. Take care, and stay safe.",

      "title": "Every day I almost kill at least one animal in my car. This isn't okay. ",
      "text": "Every day I have to drive 15 minutes to get to work, along a road that cuts through a national forest in the northeast. It's near a landfill, and there is a lot of wildlife in the area. And every day, I slam my brakes on at least once a drive, often more, for turkeys, squirrels, deer, birds, coyotes...in the last month I killed one squirrel, countless frogs and butterflies and that's considering I drive below the speed limit and am dangerously swerving around and braking to avoid wildlife. If I didn't care, my death toll would be hundreds by now.\nThe front of cars are splattered with dead bugs and it's just part of life for people, to ignore the millions of bug-killing machines flying through space and causing mass death. It's apparently just normal that I can walk five miles into the deep forest, and still hear the highway roaring. It's apparently completely normal that on that walk, I only see a single squirrel in the deep, lush forest. It's a beautiful place for wildlife, but why would anything choose to live here where you can still hear the roaring of the road? It's apparently just part of life that insect populations are dropping and insect-eating bird populations are following them, plummeting everywhere and it seems no one even bats an eye at the cars. A SINGLE TIRE releases almost 9 pounds of rubber micro plastics into the environment in it's short lifetime; an estimated 78% of the micro plastics in the ocean come from tires. When I am in the driver seat, I'm flying through space 60mph in a heavy destructive bullet that can kill anything in my path, and I can be completely closed off from that reality with the air conditioner blowing on my face and music playing- just complete total unawareness of the gravity of the situation. Cars completely desensitize you to the danger of what you are doing. Anyone who has ever gone 30mph on a bike or rollerblades knows that can be absolutely terrifying and deadly, and yet we do it daily in cars. I live somewhere where I can't get to the grocery store without a vehicle, it would be an entire day's travel on foot or even bike. Why is it built like this? These miles and miles of roads cut through beautiful forest and the only reason they have to cut through so much of it is because there are so many tiny towns miles away from each other here. If we just lived in one walkable area, so much more could become nature again. When I stand on a mountain peak, overlooking the vast beautiful mountain ranges around me, I see twenty giant grey blocks just slapped onto the landscape. Twenty rich people who decided that they are so self-important that miles of roads should be built for them, hundreds of square miles of forest cleared for their giant mansions. They are barely a speck of color sunbathing on the porch miles away, and yet believe they require all of that space. These twenty individual blocks only remind me of the view that is quickly disappearing, of the human condition of self-importance. \nWe find beautiful places and decide to colonize them, building and instantly taking away their beauty. When it should be about developing a beautiful community, separate from the places where we go to appreciate nature. Cars are ruining the planet and it's probably just too late at this point. Every community is built around cars and so few people even see how messed up it all is. ",

      "title": "Change My View: Transit Use Will Never Increase Unless Driving is Made More Inconvenient",
      "text": "I would preface by saying that I am not a troll or a hater, but I am trying to stir intellectual discussion and challenge people's thinking. I love all things trains and mass transit and work for a transit agency for my career. \n\nThat said one notion I would challenge is that the barrier to transit adoption is that transit in America isn't good. The notion that making transit good independence of making driving Inconvenient will make people use it. But I am not so sure this is the case. It seems to me that even when Transit is good, people still prefer cars. Cars offer door to door travel, whereas even the very best transit can't offer this unless you live next to transit and all your destinations are next to it. But realistically even good transit you have to transfer, walk or bike to where you want from your stop. Even the best transit, most of the time, takes you NEAR where you wanna go, where as a car can take you there directly. Even if Transit is very frequent you still have to wait and waiting always feels longer than it actually is. With cars there's no waiting involved and you can come and go as you please. Even frequent transit with 5 minute or less Headways that runs 24/7 doesn't offer the come and go convenience of a car as you can only use it when the train or bus arrives.\n\nIt seems that people only really use transit when their built environment favors transit, New York City for example is very inconvenient to drive or when there are anti-car policies in place. Almost every country with heavy transit use has policies that discourage car use. For example Japan eliminated on street parking, effectively forcing people to buy it and Eliminating the most convenient form of parking and roads are tolled. Singapore taxes driving heavily. The Northeast has no explicitly anti-car policies, but almost all roads are toll roads and parking is hella expensive and hard to find even if you wanna pay. In Europe roads are tolled heavily and gas prices are artificially high due to taxes. Dense environments while they make transit and walking more convenient, they also have the inverse effect of making driving a pain. Dense environments have less car per Capita, but more per sq foot and less space for cars per sq foot, thus driving will be less convenient.  Anecdotally when I drove in Downtown San Diego, I used a parking garage and there was literally a traffic jam inside of it. In a sprawling suburb or in small town, driving is generally very convenient by comparison. Dense areas, events and stadiums, amusement parks, airports or really anywhere that has scarce parking or lots of activity favors transit.\n\nI would point out that there was a time in American history when Transit was good, roughly prior to the 1960s - 1970s, when it was owned by private companies. However when Transit stopped being the only alternative to walking, biking and horses and cars became cheap, Transit ridership dropped like a rock. People voted with their dollars and abandoned transit once they could. Transit ridership only increased again when gas and tire rationing came and forced people out of their cars. Once gas and tire rationing ended, transit began declining once again. I do believe the government over regulated transit companies and thus helped to undermine them, but people could have voted with their dollars for transit, but instead opted for cars. Moreover, not every transit line or system in America is bad even today and there are places where people have access to it and could use it, but still opt for cars.\n\nIt seems to me that a carrot and stick is necessary for transit to be used by people other than those who cannot drive. \n\nThere's also the issue of Americans being hyper individualistic in a way that people in other parts of the world aren't. Americans hate anything that involves other people. Some people may attribute this to racism or classism, but I think this would be a problem even if America was economically equal and non racist or economically equal and homogeneous. People really do underestimate American individualism and conservatism and try to ignore it. People in other parts of the world are much more social and even if they don't use transit they would be okay with money being spent on it. Where as most Americans see transit as something that they pay for but never use.\n\nI don't see how we get less car use unless driving becomes less affordable or convenient. It seems to me a carrots only approach doesn't work.",

      "text": " Me &amp; my family are originally from NYC, but I was raised in central Florida. You absolutely need a car in Orlando to adequately get around here. I didn\u0019t know what I wanted to do career wise &amp; I was very lonely growing up. I desperately attended a small-local college &amp; majored in IT with the hopes of getting a living wage job so that I could acquire a vehicle so that I could resolve my loneliness. I was raised in a single-parent household &amp; neither my mom or older sister could adequately purchase or finance a car for me &amp; I was working minimum (starvation) wage up until I was about 23/24 (had zero credit at that time too).  \n\nThose 5-6 years of my life were very depressing &amp; lonely for me (I\u0019m 29 pushing 30). I basically had zero friends &amp; my dating life was nonexistent. I\u0019ve been struggling career-wise as, despite my experience &amp; the average salary in the field, it was out of desperation instead of what\u0019s best suited for my personality &amp; passion. I tolerated a lot of disrespect in that job since I was desperate for a living wage so that I could have a car so that I could socialize &amp; date (it was my first professional job). I got laid off from that job last year, was unemployed for the majority of this year &amp; took a massive pay-cut with my current job, currently seeking that line of work again. \n\nI\u0019m super grateful for my car (great condition &amp; paid off thankfully). I unfortunately got my mom &amp; sister into debt (high monthly car payments) as soon as I started working a living wage job, since I was so desperate to end my loneliness. Ever since I discovered &amp; researched US urban planning, I\u0019ve become a militant urbanist (I watched Not Just Bikes videos religiously all last year &amp; whenever he releases a new one). I always argue with my family &amp; a friend of mine about how car dependent infrastructure is terrible for your finances/economy, physical &amp; mental health &amp; the environment. \n\nI dream about relocating to one of these pedestrian-friendly cities (either back to NYC, some other US city or Europe). It boggles my mind how anyone can think that it\u0019s so simple/easy for anyone to purchase/finance a car when they\u0019re super expensive &amp; wages in this country have been stagnant for 40+ years (car prices have skyrocketed since the pandemic). I always argue with my buddy about this &amp; how car-centric design is terrible for socializing &amp; he always says people in major cities are less social than in car-centric cities/towns (he was raised in NYC &amp; always says how people there are standoffish &amp; are not social) &amp; he always brings up examples of how people can make it work (as if a few examples applies to everyone). \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to vent, I figured most people here could relate. It never ceases to amaze me how most Americans think that car dependency is just \u001can average part of life\u001d &amp; doesn\u0019t negatively impact one\u0019s socioeconomic status &amp; social life. If you can\u0019t afford a car for yourself, you\u0019re very limited in job prospects &amp; your social &amp; dating life will be nonexistent.",

It\u0019s infuriating cause I only live 2 miles away but none of the roads are bikeable and the few bike lanes just randomly end or force you across turning traffic, it\u0019s a complete nightmare and you have to use a car if you want to live. \n\nSide note for the car hobbyist: this place is about cities and suburbs, where there has never been and will never be a fun road to drive on.

      "text": "For a handful of decades massive malls populated citys across America. Only in the last decade or two has seen there decline as online shopping growns and old businesses die. But why where they popular? Well i propose this opinion. \n\nThey were essentially non car dependent life. You could easily do Majority of your shopping inside a mall. For shoes to lawnmowers if it had a sears. You didn't have to hop back into a car. You could also eat in them. They were inherently nice places to be in. For the most part. They provided a unique shopping experience similar to that of a non car dependent city. You could escape automobiles for a couple hours while you enjoy shopping and your friends. There popularity has lend themselves to become a stereotypical hangout spot for the cool kids and there friends and in general a hangout spot. \n\nI think that also ties back into the fact that they were escapes from automobiles and car dependency. For a kids of all ages whom didn't or couldn't drive they could gain independence inside the walls of a mall. Being able to freely vist whatever shop they wanted eat whatever they wanted without being tied to there parents for transportation. \n\nMalls where born out of consumerism and car dependency and where built around cars often having XyyyL parking lots. But they gained popularity because in my opinion they were an escape from the automobile and car dependency. People love non car dependency and hate automobiles subconsciously. Malls easily prove this. People consciously support the automobile and car dependency because thats how they live and how there parents lived. Potentially even there grandparents. Its all they have ever known and will likely know. But when brought to a place that provides a car free environment that isn't dependent on cars they enjoy it. Malls prove that. Because mall where on the inside a car free environment that was walkable. \n\nThanks for reading my opinion pieces.",

      "text": "4 years ago today, Friday November 3rd 2017, 7:30AM. At age 15 I was walking to school (freshman) and was going across a crosswalk downtown in my city where I had the light, but a small white two door car with license plate beginning in \"AHD....\" was turning left and saw me in the middle of the crosswalk but didn't stop (about 15mph) and sent me flying onto the ground. The car stopped for a few seconds and then sped off. None of the cars that were waiting on the other side of the street stopped either.\n\nNo one cared and I didn't know what to do so I just limped to school. they sent me to the hospital and had me do a police report but the police never did much looking into it and they never got the person responsible. It's been 4 years and while I've mostly recovered I still have indefinite damage to my ulnar nerve that causes some involuntary twitching and notably weakened grip strength.\n\nThis event radicalized me on my path of being anti-car. I learned a lot about the horrors of the personal motor vehicle infrastructure on both the environment and the economy. I never learned to drive, nor do I intend to. I always ride my bike or take the bus, and only even get inside a car as a passenger probably once a month, only when I absolutely have no choice. \n\nIn a few days I will be taking the train to Seattle to visit friends because after years I haven't forgotten what cars have taken from me. I'll get to travel light, cheap, and listen to music or sleep on the way there and back, which I couldn't do in a Chevro-loser or a Poo-baru. My brother told me about this sub and it seemed like a good place to share my story.\n\nTL;DR: 4 year anniversary of getting hit by a car and getting radicalized as a result",

      "title": "I think aggressive drivers are a side effect of US roads being completely impassable.",
      "text": "I see a lot of posts here talking about aggressive drivers, memeing on them for doing crazy maneuvers and putting others around them at risk to shave a few seconds off their commute time. To a degree I understand, but I wanted to share my own experience and factors that have made my own driving behavior much more aggressive as time goes on.\n\nI want to point out that selfish driving behavior is very rare in European countries. I personally have done a lot of research on this topic (spent some time there as well) and I don't think this is a result of some secret formula that the Europeans adopted and want to keep to themselves. Its because the fantastic pedestrian infrastructure REMOVES loads of vehicles from the road that don't have to be there, which in turn allows you to actually get places by car. Driver satisfaction in a country like the Netherlands is much higher than the US for example.\n\nOn US roads, they are completely clogged up with people who have no actual need to drive, but are required to because its their only option. US roads generally have much lower capacity/traffic flow than European roads as well because the least amount of time and thought and money is put into their design. Where Europeans prioritize continuous/free flowing intersections like roundabouts, the US likes to build a highway and put 8 traffic signal intersections along a 1 mile stretch of road, followed by left and right hand turns everywhere WITH NO TURN LANES causing drivers that have to turn to hold up everyone behind them while they slow down and wait for an opening to turn, creating an environment where drivers that want to go straight have to sit and wait for ages.\n\nAdditionally, European road design minimizes drivers having to put their car in a position where it can cause an accident if they're not paying attention or don't know how to drive. I want you to think about your average American stroad, where people are constantly turning onto it, off of it against traffic going straight, and having to make really sketchy turns across 6-8 lanes. All it takes is one wrong move and BANG, now people are dead.\n\nNow I'm sure at this point you're asking yourself, \"What does any of this have to do with the guy who cut me off or flew by me doing a buck 30?\". It's because Humans are naturally lazy creatures. We want the most results for the least amount of work. This is why public transportation is so popular in Europe, because you get to your destination easily and without breaking the bank. In the US, drivers spend 1000$ per month on average to own a car just to have the most stressful and miserable traveling experience out of any developed nation. Endless redlights, sitting there for hours just to go a few miles, constantly avoiding accidents death and injury, people doing whatever they want with no consideration for the drivers around them, people in slower vehicles hogging the passing lanes, big slow trucks holding everyone up, it all gets very old given enough time.\n\nThe aggressive driver is in my opinion a direct result of these conditions. I don't think anyone wakes up and just decides to drive like that, it's something they're molded into over time not because they care about \"shaving off a few seconds\", it's because they're miserable the entire time they're behind the wheel and they have no alternatives. This has been my experience to a tee. When I first started driving, I was courteous, never so much as went 10 over the speed limit or ran a stop sign, and now find myself doing whatever is necessary to get out of the car faster. I hate it. I hate driving and I fucking hate cars.\n\nThere's also a flip side to this coin as well. Not everyone copes with how stressful it is to drive by being an asshole on the road. Loads of people cope by being on their phone the entire time they're behind the wheel, so they don't have to think about how much it sucks. This in my opinion causes way more problems than the asshole driver. The asshole driver catches your attention, but statistically speaking the \"sleeper\" (as I like to call them) causes way more accidents and fatalities by an order of magnitude, and that's exacerbated by the shitty road design that creates so many points of conflict, which in turn makes aggressive drivers want to drive even more aggressively, so they can get away from the sleepers before they do something stupid and get them killed.\n\nThis isn't a post defending aggressive drivers. I'm not defending their behavior or mine, I'm just attempting to raise awareness that people who drive like assholes are the effect not the cause, and try to share my thoughts on why that is.",

      "title": "Welcome to /r/Fuckcars",
      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

      "text": "A \u001climinal space\u001d is a term used to describe environments whose construction is evidently intentional, but whose purpose is not. Moreover, in them there is a temporal ambiguity, a sense of both transience and eternity at once, that makes them almost seem like a place out of time. A liminal space appears forlorn and purgatorial, a disorienting expanse of elements both familiar and alien, thrown together almost without reason, that silently expresses to it\u0019s observers:\n\nYou do not belong here.\nThis is not a place for you.\nYou are not welcome.\n\nLiminal spaces give an eerie, estranging feeling for the same reason that hyperrealistic robots do: they fall into an uncanny valley, of an architectural/environmental kind. There is something off about them, nearly normal, but not quite. The proportions are all wrong. They are geometrically alienating, inhospitable and unnavigable, for any human being that finds themselves within them.\n\nThe reality of car centric infrastructure is inherently liminal. It is inherently dehumanizing and anonymizing, to such an extent that phenomena like road rage becomes commonplace, as drivers less and less see each other as people and more and more see each other as obstacles. For anyone unlucky enough to be cast into such an environment without a car, the very architecture around them is inhuman, and even downright dangerous. \n\nYou are not welcome to participate in society without a car. You are not free to move without a car. There is no place for you in the interim between designated work and play spaces without a car. Anyone who has been stuck on the side of a highway knows this feeling, this banal and deadly alienation.\n\nThis is a fundamentally inhuman world we are constructing, a nameless nowhereland , a blasted waste of asphalt and concrete, with barely any comfortable or inviting corner for human existence.

They\u0019re fine with shitting on cars as long as they aren\u0019t reminded they personally contribute to the problem and would have to give up some of their comforts.\n\nI just wanted to counter the growing sentiment I\u0019m seeing here that cars aren\u0019t a problem at all and it\u0019s actually all just car infrastructure. While car infrastructure is a *huge* piece of the problem, cars themselves definitely are an issue too.\n\nGenerally, automobiles are bad for the environment due to consumption of gasoline and the resulting carbon emissions, and car tires alone are a major source of micro particle pollution in our oceans. Cars are loud as hell, and they keep growing to become essentially tanks on wheels. And that\u0019s just a starting list of why cars are a problem.\n\nI love that so many new folks are being made aware of the (largely negative) impact that car infrastructure has on our lives, but cars themselves are included in that as well. Contrary to comments and posts from many people new here, the basis of this sub has *never* been \u001cfuck car infrastructure but we still love cars.\u001d\n\nEdit: So many people missing the entire fucking point have me questioning folks\u0019 reading comprehension skills.\n\nI never said the sub has one message and should only have one message. I said I am *countering* a common narrative I see in comments and posts that tends to go a little like, \u001cWell no one here actually hates cars or thinks cars are a problem. We all just hate car infrastructure.\u001d No, that\u0019s *not* how many of us feel. And that was never the sole basis of this community, so folks need to stop pretending that\u0019s how we all think.\n\nI also never said we need to ban all cars everywhere, so I\u0019m not sure whose ass people are pulling that out of.

You know, those places you drive to then walk around and pretend you live in a car-free walkable neighborhood.\n\nI was walking across one of the pedestrian zones where you can cross anywhere in any direction, and car drivers need to drive slowly and yield. Several other people were crossing and I didn't see any cars nearby so I went across. I was almost to the other side and out of nowhere I was hit from behind and landed on the hood of a car. They were turning and didn't bother looking. Their car's pedestrian system didn't stop them from hitting me either. I fell onto the hood and hopped right off.\n\nI was hit by an EV, specifically a Tesla Model Y. I didn't hear it come around the corner because it makes no noise. Or at least if it did, I could never hear it over the noise of the environment.\n\nThe driver got out and immediately looks for damage to their car before even looking to see if I was okay. Then got angry at me for denting and scratching their hood with my ass. They still never asked if I was okay, but rather demand that I pay to repair their \"expensive new car\" which they repeated several times. I told them no, they hit me in a pedestrian zone where I have right of way, they failed to yield and hit me from behind. They said they would \"call the cops and have me arrested\" Like, lmao, for what? I told them \"Go ahead, call them, tell them you hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk\" Yes, they actually call the freaking cops. I didn't bother with their crap and just went on with my day since I wasn't hurt. I got my shopping done, went back to my bike, and went home.\n\nI can not believe people. More worried about their car than they are about injuring people with it. \n\nPeople rely way too heavily on modern car safety systems. Systems that time and again and been proven to not work when they are needed most. After all, car brands just need their system to pass a standardized test that's nothing like the real world. It doesn't matter if it actually works.\n\nI'm just glad I'm okay. Next time I might not get so lucky.",

      "text": "I've been meaning to do this write-up for a little while. A significant portion of people who are at least lukewarm to the idea of reducing car dependency are extremely reluctant about any criticism of their own car, or criticism of the concept of car ownership. And I think it's good to set the record straight:\n\nFuck your car.\n\nI don't like your car. I don't like that it exists, I don't like where it's parked, and I don't like where it's driven. And frankly, I don't care what you do with the car: I still don't like your car. It's a big waste of space that serves as street litter 95% of the time and acts as a deadly bullet flying through spaces where people live the other 5%.\n\nBut, you may say, I have reasons for driving this car. Public transit doesn't exist where I live, I have a big family, I live 30 kilometres from work, I'm a car enthusiast and drive it on a track, I need it to haul furniture, and I use it for work sometimes.\n\nBut still: Fuck your car. I don't care how valid or invalid those reasons are. If they're invalid, then fuck you, and get rid of the car already. If they're valid\u0014and they're often really not, but let's say they are\u0014then that sucks. It sucks that circumstance makes it so that operating a loud giant metal cage of death, pollution and climate disaster is the only viable option for you.\n\nBut still: Fuck your car. Your valid reasons don't make me dislike cars any less. Your valid reasons don't decrease the car's harm to the climate or people's living environments. If anything, we should change circumstance to invalidate your reasons for operating the damned thing so that you can get rid of it already.\n\nThere exists a future without private vehicles. We probably want to keep ambulances, fire trucks, buses, and some industrial vehicles, but there exists a future where public spaces\u0014all public spaces\u0014belong to people again. A future where the biggest private mobility tools are the size of golf carts.\n\nAnd the sooner we can get rid of your fucking car, the better.",

Nobody really knows.\u001d The former US president added that rising sea levels, caused by melting glaciers, would have the benefit of creating \u001cmore oceanfront property\u001d.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk, meanwhile, said it was wrong to \u001cvilify\u001d the oil and gas industry, the key driver of planet-heating pollution, and that the only imperative to ditch fossil fuels was that they will one day run dry.\n\n&gt;\u001cIf we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,\u001d said Musk, who is also chief executive of the electric car company Tesla. \u001cWe do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;\u001cWe still have quite a bit of time & we don\u0019t need to rush and we don\u0019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that. Like, leave the farmers alone.\u001d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk said the main danger of allowing carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere was that at some point it will become difficult to breathe, causing \u001cheadaches and nausea\u001d to people. This would occur with CO2 at about 1,000 parts per million of the Earth\u0019s atmosphere, more than double the current record-breaking concentrations.\n\nTo be clear, this is a problem soon because we're talking about indoor air which needs to be replaced with outdoor air. The higher outdoor CO2 concentration makes that process more difficult. We don't have to wait until the atmospheric levels are 1000 ppm https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000237 \n\nI think this pretty much confirms what we've been saying for years:  electric cars are here to save the car industry, not the planet. \n\n",

Everything though takes around 20-30mins or an hour to walk to so it's still not the most walkable. \nI had to go to the doctor today and I ended up walking there. This took 35 mins to walk there. The nurse took my temperature, heart beat monitor, and blood pressure, the usual. The nurse asked me was I exercising cause everything was higher than normal. And I told him I walked there and he turned to me all shook and said \"You walked here?!\". -_-. I grew up in Philly where you walked everywhere or took public transit so I naturally walk. Ever since I moved to this town, it seems like everyone is so shook I walk anywhere even when there's sidewalks around. We need to make walking more natural again and not an oddity. Also today was the first time I ever saw someone ride a bike around in the town. We need to normalize biking and walking seriously. It shouldn't be shocking to see someone walking or biking.

As I was approaching a crosswalk, a car making a right turn nearly hit me as it entered my apartment complex. My knee-jerk response was to slap the trunk of his car. I waved my arms, showing how he nearly hit me. The driver, clearly angry, screeched a U-turn and stopped his car. Given Arizona's temper tantrum statistics and loose gun laws, I kept running.\n\nI believe the car-oriented suburban environment, the lack of a proper education system, and the summer temperatures exceeding 110 degrees have drained the humanity out of Phoenix drivers. I moved here from the Seattle area two years ago, and it was a terrible decision. Sure, Phoenix claims to \"add extensive bike lanes\" and \"pedestrian safety features,\" but all of that is merely nonsense. Unprotected bike lanes and adding a couple of HAWK crossings for a city of 1.6 million is laughable. People here complain about how \"Californians\" are ruining the state. If anything, those disgruntled and isolated Arizona boomers are the ones ruining this state. They sit in their homes, depleting the limited groundwater supply for their water-hungry lawns and pools, remaining disgustingly sedentary as they use their portable living rooms to drive to Costco. Some of these people need therapy, and endangering someone not in a +5,000 lb cage doesn't count. \n\nArizona ranks first for road rage (source: [**https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-ranks-first-for-road-rage-in-u-s-report-says**](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-ranks-first-for-road-rage-in-u-s-report-says)) and fourth for deadly road rage (source: [**https://www.azfamily.com/2022/08/23/arizona-ranks-4-states-with-most-deadly-road-rage-shootings-study-says/**](https://www.azfamily.com/2022/08/23/arizona-ranks-4-states-with-most-deadly-road-rage-shootings-study-says/)).

Living in the suburbs, this means even a trip to the local café necessities driving, which in my case meant either asking my mom for a ride, begging her to let me use her car (unlikely, technically illegal for me to drive alone until I got my license in 2021; yeah, we couldn\u0019t afford adding a young man to the insurance plan until then), calling an Uber or taxi (expensive), or braving the walk half without sidewalks and surrounded by 40 mph traffic (downright deadly). She was usually happy to give me a ride wherever, but it still made mobility more complicated and tedious, and gas money was always a concern. Dating under those circumstances is especially awkward. \n\nFriends with cars were usually understanding and happy to give me a ride, but those friends themselves were few, because opportunities to meet people are slim when you\u0019re homeschooled your entire youth, can\u0019t afford college, and the only event your town holds is the fucking Police Officer\u0019s National Night Out (fuck that, ACAB). Meeting local friends through work was basically my only option, and that\u0019s a touchy environment to truly make connections. Still made a precious few though, who I love dearly.\n\nMy point? Car centrism is a prison to the poor. Practically speaking, I was locked inside my own neighborhood as far as my own power of locomotion was concerned, all for the obscene risk of becoming roadkill if I ventured further by foot. I know 2 people in my town who were struck by vehicles while walking. 1 was a 12 year old getting off the school bus, the other a 60 year old simply out getting exercise. The 12 year old\u0019s family is still in medical debt, and the 60 year old was basically scalped by the car that hit him. Both are still alive and doing well now, thank god.

      "text": "Have you ever come across a post (4 days ago) claiming  ''Walking 400-500m takes about 6-7 minutes which is a lot of time and are also uncomfortable.'' In the comments, not the main post, we also find that it used as an argument for car lifestyle since no one would want to do such a hassle; a car ''can travel 5-6 km in that time''.\n\nLet's embark on a journey in which we ignore that there exist other alternatives such as cycling, skateboard, etc. Let\u0019s also ignore that some people would rather walk than drive, we also ignore the advantage of an active lifestyle, such as better physical and mental health, etc.\n\nLet\u0019s ignore everything and just compared with the epitome of car-centric living, USA. We will delve into three different scenarios: a stadium, a university campus, and a shopping mall. Armed with Google Maps' pedometer tool, let's find the truth of peak car.\n\nCase 1: NRG stadium. NRG stadium is literally surrounded by parking.  Ignoring the potential seating position on the opposite end (which is a 250 meter walk), the closest parking is 100 meters away, extending to over 750 meters for some attendees.\n\nCase 2: Houston Christian University where we will disregard parking challenges. Picture yourself at the campus after a thrilling football game. Opting for a leisurely walk to the library (on campus)? That's 500 meters. If the hospital (on campus) is your destination, it's a 1000-meter stroll. \n\nCase 3: Mall of America. Setting aside parking concerns once more, the farthest shops in the mall are a mere 500 meters apart. \n\nInescapable conclusion: Even in peak car environment, people need to walk. Yet, this exploration barely scratches the surface: less car -&gt; less parking and road -&gt; shortest distance between everything -&gt; less walking. Despite overlooking several factors, it's evident that peak car scenarios don't necessarily trump walking in various situations. In light of this, I question the original post, was it misinformed or a bit of trolling.",

      "text": "I don't speed. Speeding saves somewhere between zero and a couple minutes at absolute best. Most Americans seem to think that, if they don't speed, they'll be horribly late to wherever they're trying to get to. But this isn't the case. The only time I'm ever late is if I left late. Driving is so much less stressful since I never have to worry about cops, among other things. I got one written warning for speeding when I was 17, and that's it. 6 years and tens of thousands of miles later, that remains the only thing resembling a citation I've ever gotten.\n\nWhen I tell people this, their reactions range from \"yeah, ok i guess,\" to \"wtf man?\" It's just insane to me how ingrained speeding has become to driving, especially in the US. Literally none of the people I've talked to have ever considered that speeding is a bad thing that they shouldn't do, they just come up with their own justifications for it (which are all bullshit anyway).\n\nOh, and the funny thing is that I'm a huge racing enthusiast. I've driven my car at the limit in controlled environments (aka the track) more often than most truck owners put something in the bed. If anyone was qualified or compelled to speed on public roads, it would be me. But I don't. Racing taught me how incredibly quickly things can get out of control while behind the wheel. Plus, I've seen dozens of people drive like homicidal maniacs, only for me to catch up with or even pass them at the next light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a good driver isn't hard.\n\n\nEdit: just wanted to clarify. Yes, I do speed up (within reason) if the surrounding traffic is going significantly faster than me. I spend 95% of my time on the highway in the far right lane, and my strategy is to find large gaps in traffic and hang out there. But if people are going 10-15mph over in residential areas? They can figure it out. I'm good going the limit.",

      "title": "I'm on City Council. Here's How to Fix Your City:",
      "text": "(Wall of text alert - not sorry.) I'm making real change in my city, with more exciting things to come. Do you want your city to be built around people, not cars? Here's the six-step plan that is working for me:\n\n**1) Get involved in local politics.** Your local government is run by hard-working nerds who show up to meetings. You can be one of them. But if that's definitely not for you, you should at least be emailing your representatives every few months. You would be amazed at how much weight is placed on correspondence from constituents who speak up. You can do what I did and run for your City Council. But you don't have to. Find out when your Planning and Zoning, Adjustment Board, and City Council meets. Email your representatives your perspective about specific items on the agenda. Volunteer to be part of a citizen review process. Volunteer to be on your town's tree commission or whatever so that you start making connections and have a longer resume when there's an opening on a Planning Board or neighborhood steering committee to apply for. Changing the place you live is incredibly rewarding. It's the most fun I've ever had with a hobby. People in your town are going to accumulate power and shape the way it looks in 25 years. Why not you? You chances will be better if you . . .\n\n**2) Get informed.** Read books about development and the looming fiscal and infrastructure disaster car-oriented cities are headed toward. Learn what your city spends taxpayer money on (\"What does it say about our values that we spend $4.7 million on roads and only $27,000 on sidewalks?\"). Learn the extent to which quick-moving traffic and ubiquitous free parking make everything worse for people. The more you learn, the more equipped you'll be to . . .\n\n**3) Learn to make your case.** If your goal is to get angrier and angrier alongside people who think exactly like you without ever improving things, then you can skip this part and stick to posting memes in niche subreddits. But for most of us, it is important to learn to persuade conventional thinkers. A radical is easily dismissed. It's harder to dismiss someone who can appeal to perspectives everyone shares. When I try to persuade my liberal friends I talk about pedestrian access for the people who can't drive and the disproportionate burdens parking minimums place on the poor. Oh, and climate change. When I talk to my Trump-loving family, I say I'm trying to bring back the fiscally-responsible, traditional building patterns that our our forefathers understood. I'm bringing back the front porch and kids playing outside and knowing your neighbors and supporting local businesses. \"Of course if someone wants a big house and a big acreage and to drive and park everywhere, that's their right. I just don't think they should expect other people to subsidize it, which is how things work out now.\"\n\nRemember that people don't usually change their minds if you engage them in an argument. If your interlocutor says something stupid, ask them why they think that's true. If they say \"why should we build bike lanes when hardly anybody bikes?\" you say \"that's a good question, in my opinion that's like asking why should we build bridges when hardly anybody swims across the river?\" The more you practice this, the better you'll get at bringing people along, which means you're starting to . . .\n\n**4) Build a coalition.** Asking most people you know to change their minds about auto-oriented infrastructure is like asking a fish to change its mind about water. So you have to meet them where they are. But if you can convince one person every three months that things need to change in your city and then over the next three months you each convince a person and so on, then in 3 years you will have a coalition 2000+ strong. Frankly, unless your city is enormous, that is far more than you need to effect real change. Especially if the people you influence are involved in local politics (see step 1). And while you're building your coalition, you need to . . .\n\n**5) Patiently persist.** Stupid things with too much off-street parking will be built and you won't be able to stop them. Ask questions. Suggest alternatives. But don't be the angry crazy person everyone ignores. Just be patient and persist. Local government moves slow and just because your staff agrees with you doesn't mean they assign the same priority to things you do. So learn to send an email every six weeks - \"Hey, where are we at on looking at parking minimums?\" It's satisfying to finally get something to completion, but it's not like a race. It's professional kitten herding. So you have to learn to . . .\n\n**6) Be content with incremental progress.** I'm on a City Council with six other people, two of whom are starting to come around and another who will vote with us on anything. We just hired a Strong Towns-friendly City Manager. My City Engineer is doing book studies with me (he committed to reading \"The High Cost of Free Parking\"). And in spite of all that I still know that things won't be completely different next year. I wish I could snap my fingers and pedestrianize our main street. I wish I could fund a pilot project running a frequent bus back and forth on a fixed route through our transit-free midsize town. I wish I could eliminate parking minimums everywhere tomorrow. But the hurdles to that are high and there's a decent chance someone who ran against me next election would win. What I can do (and have done) is get our main street closed for summer weekends. Two years ago, we had 3 restaurants do outdoor dining in the city right of way where a parking spot used to be. It was highly contentious. Now we have 15 and they're universally embraced. Local change happens incrementally and experimentally. And the obstacles and barriers will tempt you to cynicism and despair. But change does happen steadily. You can accomplish almost nothing in a year. But you'll be amazed at how different things can be in five years.\n\n**Conclusion.** It's worth it. You have no idea how gratifying it feels for me to walk with my children along a sidewalk in our town that is there because I made it happen, protected from traffic by a boulevard that used to have an unnecessary lane of travel, on the way to an outdoor patio at our favorite restaurant that would not exist if I hadn't chosen to get involved. And good design is contagious. I get that it's not possible for everyone, but if you've ever thought about getting more involved in local politics, I strongly encourage you to do it. Somebody else is thinking about the same, and they're probably wrong about how to build the urban environment. So why not you?",

      "text": "I have an extremely car enthusiastic classmate, who is so incredibly carbrained, that it just boggles my mind. Of course he doesn't care about the environment until I talk about public transportation. When he told me \"WeLl HoW eLsE wOuLd We GeT aRoUnD?\", I started talking about how good trams and trains are and he told me \"Well how do they get powered?\", I told him \"electricity\" and then his answer was \"Well how do we get electricity?\", that's besides the point, it doesn't matter if it comes from, we can change that anyway, but I told him \"It doesn't matter, because a lot more people can fit on a bus or a tram\". His answer was \"I don't want to sit on a bus with homeless people\". I can understand that, except there are no homeless people on the bus, because the bus driver wouldn't let them on. Another time when going to school by bus, at the bus stop an idiot smashed into the back of the bus, making everyone get off the bus. This wasn't a problem, because another bus came like 6 minutes later, but when I arrived at school and told my classmates \"An idiot crashed into the back of the bus\", he told me \"It was probably a cyclist\". That wouldn't do shit to the bus. So I told him \"Why, what's wrong with cyclists?\" and he answered with \"Their existence\". My brother in Christ, has the auto industry bribed you? Don't forget we're both 15-16 years old, we can't own cars (I'm European). When I told him it was a red car, he said \"The bus was probably in a wrong place\", in a bus stop?! He is not the only carbrained individual in my class, but he's the most vocal one. Also, when I told everyone that I hate how many cars there are and how much space they take up, they told me it was my problem. I just hate how carbrained Hungary is. Send help.",

      "title": "Don't like Tyre Extuingishers? Cool, but please read this first",
      "text": "Since their start, Tyre Extinguishers has often appeared in this sub, drawing praise and criticism. Not everyone in this sub appreciates deflating tyres of SUVs to make a point.\n\nAs a result, all TX posts see a flood of similar comments opposing their actions. Unfortunately, many arguments are based on misunderstanding what TX actually is and does or what direct action entails.\n\nWhile obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it would be a shame if we kept running around and regurgitating the same talking points. So, to help the discussion move along, here's a list of commonly used thoughts on why TX sucks, with a short reaction.\n\n\\---\n\n* **This will only aggravate SUV drivers and turn them against your cause.**  \nEverything you do to prevent people from driving more and larger SUVs will turn SUV drivers against you. To quote a wise man or woman: 'If a protest doesn't inconvenience, it's not a protest; it's a picnic.' TX is not looking to make friends with drivers. They want unnecessary SUVs off the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is dangerous. Letting people drive around with deflated tyres is incredibly irresponsible.**  \nTX leaves a leaflet on the windshield to alert drivers that their tyres are deflated. That, combined with possible warning lights in the car and the fact that any driver will quickly notice a flat tyre, means the real chance of someone driving off with their flat tyre is negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **So now a diesel-powered tow truck has to make extra trips to get the SUV back on the road? I'm suddenly pretending to be hyper-focused on emissions, and this seems counter-productive.**  \nThe goal of deflating tyres is not to reduce the number of trips of that particular vehicle. Instead, TX is after the large-scale systemic change by spreading its message far and wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Some people live where a car is the only option, you know?**  \nThen TX will be no problem. They clearly state they only operate in urban environments. So nobody will have their tyres deflated in the suburbs or rural areas. Not by TX, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is not an effective way to spread your message.**  \nLiterally, hundreds and hundreds of news articles from all over the world, including some really nuanced background stories in some of the most prominent outlets, beg to differ. TX has been remarkably effective in spreading its anti-SUV arguments to the general audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Imagine being a single mother with three jobs/a poor worker just trying to get by and finding your tyres deflated, with no money to call roadside service and now you lose your job and whaa-whaa!**  \nTX clearly states they target posh vehicles in upscale neighbourhoods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **What if people need to haul stuff for their work? Or need a large vehicle to store their wheelchair?**  \nTX clearly states they don't target vehicles clearly marked as for work or for disabled or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This will do nothing to reduce the number of cars on the road.**  \nTX clearly states they are against SUVs and large 4x4s in urban area's. They are unnecessarily dangerous and polluting. TX are not anti-car per se.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Why target innocent individuals? They should target oil companies/car manufacturers/car dealers/politicians instead!**  \nPlease look at this handy '[Moderates guide to doing absolutely nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/y30j3q/based_on_actual_conversations_on_this_sub/)' made especially for you.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **We support slashing tyres now?**  \nTX doesn't slash tyres. They deflate them. Pump 'em back up, and SUVs are back on the road; message sent, no damage done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I've thought up a scenario where someone who doesn't deserve it is still terribly inconvenienced by their flat tyre. But I bet you haven't considered that, huh?!**  \nSince around 35 million SUVs were sold in 2021 alone (roughly 45 per cent of all cars sold), and TX claims to have deflated 10,000 vehicles in just over half a year, that scenario is implausible.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I heard they deflate the tyres of eSUVs and hybrids as well, proving my theory that they are not environmentalists, just hooligans.**  \nElectric or hybrid SUVs are still unsafe and, in many cases, unnecessary. Furthermore, tailpipe emissions are not the only pollution. Besides the large carbon footprint these enormous cars have, tyre wear causes tremendous particle pollution. eSUVS are typically heavier and have more torque, causing more strain on tyres and thus polluting more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I understand their point, but I am against touching people's personal stuff.**  \nFair enough. But remember that SUVs are more dangerous for those not inside that vehicle, take up more public space and emit more pollution for you to breathe in. They mess with you personally every day, and drivers seem to either not know or not care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **If you want to get your point across, why not attend a protest? Why not take up a role in your local government? Why not do this or that?**  \nAll of those things can exist together. Disruptive direct action is not a substitute for protesting or actively shaping policy. It's an addition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **There are better ways to protest.**  \nPlease leave them in the comments so we can learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTX have [a website](https://www.tyreextinguishers.com/) where you can read what they do and why they do it. Makes of lot of comments in this sub redundant.",

      "text": "I wanted to share a personal experience on how not owning a car has significantly boosted my savings and helped build wealth over time.\n\nLiving in a tier-1 city presents its own unique set of challenges, but it has also provided me with valuable lessons on smart investments. For instance, instead of buying a car\u0014which I could have easily afforded\u0014I chose to invest the money that would have otherwise gone towards the initial cost, insurance, maintenance, fuel, and repairs. This decision has not only saved me a significant amount of money but also allowed me to allocate those funds into more profitable and less depreciating assets. By making this choice, I\u0019ve been able to grow my wealth and avoid the financial burden that often comes with car ownership in a busy urban environment.\n\nI decided to move closer to my office, which significantly saved me both money and time. The daily 2 km walk not only helped me stay fit but also freed up extra time for my hobbies. On days when I felt too tired to walk, I conveniently used carpooling services and Uber. This change has really boosted my health and productivity, showing it's a smart and cost-effective choice.\n\nChoosing not to own a car has been one of the best financial decisions I've made!

      "text": "**tl;dr: Carbrains rampaging about having to pay for school busses they don't use, I got upset and wrote a screed about why it's not a bad thing and helps illuminate generally why public transportation is important.**\n\nA recent conversation about dropping or charging additional fees for the bus at our daughter\u0019s school makes a good argument (in my mind) at least why public transportation should be subsidized.  I don\u0019t know if I\u0019ll be brave enough to share it with the other families there, but we\u0019ll see ... I suspect that their angry posts on Whatsapp will fall on deaf ears, and I shouldn't feed the trolls.  But I had to write it.  But for this community, any thoughts on how to improve the argument or whether I should share it?\n\nAn argument that we heard from those who drive their kids to school was: \\`\\`It\u0019s not fair that the general school budget pays for kids to ride the bus, the cost of riding the bus should fall entirely on those who ride it.\u0019\u0019\n\nThe counterargument that I would make is that there are benefits to drivers from those riding the bus, but they are perhaps hard to see.  They are, in my mind: less congestion on the roads, a commitment to the environment, and a more welcoming school.  I\u0019ll talk about each of them individually first and then connect it back to how the same argument applies to society generally.\n\nEveryone at the school complains about how dangerous and crowded the dropoff area is in the morning: ending the bus program or making it more expensive would encourage more people to drive to school.  The facilities there are already pushed to the limit; disinvesting from the bus would mean having to spend even more money on parking lots and traffic control (I\u0019ll point out that bus riders are subsidizing the parking lots with *their* tuition & I would hope that they begin charging those who drive for parking and for road maintenance if everyone needs to pay their fare share).    \n\nLikewise, the school likes to crow about how green it is, going so far as to install solar panels.  But if the school legitimately wants to reduce its carbon footprint, getting *more* students riding the bus is the most immediate and cost-effective way to accomplish those goals.  Moreover, the school is in tension with its neighbors; more traffic on Chateau drive will make the local leaders less likely to be okay with future school expansion (which is a stated goal) even if it has the road capacity to handle more students.\n\nAnd there are some families for whom it is easier to drive their kids to school than for others.  The bus could be the difference between them attending or not.  Their parents might not be able to drive because they lack the ability to drive (e.g., because of health reasons, as afflicted our family recently, thankfully temporarily), because of work obligation, or because they live in a part of the city where it doesn\u0019t make sense to own a car (or multiple cars).  Those students might well disappear entirely from the school if the bus becomes unaffordable or unavailable.\n\nAnd all of these apply generally to society as well: less public transportation means more traffic and more money spent on roads, there is a very high cost to giving away free parking, public transportation and walkable communities are the best path toward a carbon neutral future, and public transportation makes people who would otherwise not be a part of society able to participate.\n\nAnd sadly, what I expect will happen at the school is that the subsidy will likely disappear and that\u0014like many American public transportation options\u0014it will enter a death spiral: the service will be cut back, it will cease to be a reliable option for many, the per-rider costs will soar, and then it will cease to be sustainable, leading to cancellation entirely.  And I believe that this will leave the school worse off: more traffic, a less diverse student body, and less sustainable. ",

It is the trainsets that are at issue here.\n\nThere are two trainset proposals that the waiver is seeking approval for.\n\nThe first proposal is from Siemens and would use trainsets based off the Velaro series, which has been successfully used in several other countries [for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Velaro). For the Brightline West project, the first two trainsets would be made and assembled overseas, and the remaining 8 would be assembled in the US with their structure, frame, and paintwork made overseas.\n\nThe second proposal is from Alstom. This proposal would use trainsets based on the new Acela trainsets. Like the new Acela trainsets, these would assembled in Hornell, New York. As many of us know, the new Acela trainsets have been delayed for three years and counting due to [numerous problems](https://www.businessinsider.com/amtraks-new-acela-trains-manufacturing-defects-oig-audit-2023-10) \\- and not a single one has entered service.\n\nYet despite these facts, several politicians from upstate New York (it wouldn't surprise me if they've never traveled by high-speed rail - or any train - at all) have commented on the FRA's waiver request and are trying to get the FRA to only accept the likely-inferior Alstom proposal. Some have even argued that this is the only way to benefit \"local communities\" - but of course, they're not talking about local communities in Nevada or California, they're talking about local communities in upstate New York.\n\nLet me be clear: **This is a Nevada and California project that New York has no right to benefit from, just like how Nevada and California have no right to benefit from a New York project.**\n\nThese politicians are...\n\n1. Completely ignoring (or worse, deliberately sidestepping) the harm that delaying this project would have on local communities. [Congestion](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/i-15-south-to-california-jammed-again-as-2023-begins-2701236/) on I-15 is a problem - and it also exacerbates the [pollution](https://news3lv.com/news/local/las-vegas-air-quality-ranked-among-dirtiest-in-the-us) problem.\n2. Completely ignoring (or worse, deliberately sidestepping) the harm that delaying this project would have on the environment. The [busiest](https://simpleflying.com/what-are-the-usas-busiest-domestic-air-routes/) domestic air route in the US is between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Short flights like that are unnecessary and harmful to the environment, and Las Vegas' airport is also [dangerously close](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/as-harry-reid-airport-grows-so-does-the-need-for-another-airport-2723758/) to hitting capacity limits.\n3. Trying to treat Brightline West as a jobs program instead of a transportation service.\n4. Perpetuating xenophobia. (or, to be more specific, not-invented-here syndrome.)\n\nLeave a comment **by January 25** to tell the FRA to unconditionally approve Brightline West's waiver request - in particular, the Siemens proposal - and help get this show on the (rail)road. The environment is calling on you.\n\nI'd recommend focusing on the reasons why local communities will benefit from HSR, as well as the respective track records of Siemens and Alstom.\n\n[https://www.regulations.gov/document/FRA-2023-0099-0001](https://www.regulations.gov/document/FRA-2023-0099-0001)",

It is obviously impossible to eat anything other than beef so please stfu about any other food source         \n\nReason 2: Cycling is healthy. Healthy people live longer. This means that they have a longer time alive where they're consuming goods that cause emissions. If only people didn't cycle then they'd die sooner and thus no longer cause emissions. Luckily, people who drive everywhere tend to have very bad health and thus will die sooner! Drive to save the planet!    \n\nReason 3: Cars cause emissions which cause health problems for other people too! So driving is a win-win where you both kill yourself sooner AND others as well! Think of the huge emission savings we're making here!        \n\nReason 4: Cars are dangerous. They kill a lot of people. These are once again people who won't cause any further emissions. That's even more gains in terms of climate change right there.    \n\nI dare any one of you to find even the slightest error in my logic. It can't be done. Cycling is horrible for the environment and we should all be driving cars. And the bigger, the better.",

      "text": "After browsing through countless stories and Reddit posts of cars parking in bike and bus lanes, civilian cars driving through pedestrian and cyclist-only park trails, and cars somehow finding their way to invading pedestrianized areas in European cities, I have come to the conclusion that unless we have hard barriers and rules that prohibit cars in certain areas, cars will continue to invade car-free areas.\n\nCars are the reason many people don't cycle, it's because they don't want to f\\*cking die! Cars are the reason your bus is late, it's because people driving by themselves arrogantly take up lots space that could be put to better use, and selfishly park in the bus-only lane. Cars are the reason you can't walk at peace, it's because you constantly have to be aware of these metal m\\*rder machines. Cars are the reason you don't see kids outside playing anymore, it's because the outside environment is a hellish, dangerous landscape because it prioritizes cars and not people and their children.\n\nCars make the world a shittier place and will continue to invade car-free areas unless we stop them. Put up bollards to total any car that tries to invade. Create truly bus-only lanes by having a crash barrier between the bus lane and the normal lane, and also a gate at the start of the lane for good measure so that no car can sneak through. Create pedestrianized plazas where children and adults alike can enjoy a place free from the fear of motor vehicles. Only by prohibiting cars and preventing their invasion can we truly have a liveable place. Thanks for listening!",

There are several of those flashing light pedestrian crossings along said stroad, and a park where kids regularly play and people hang out.  Tons of foot traffic.  And these idiots use it as a drag strip.  You can hear them slamming on the gas for a mile each direction.\n\nBeing obsessed with acceleration is a part of larger car culture that I don't think gets talked about enough.  Speed kills, and being able to get up to speed faster might feel safer to drivers since it allows them to merge into traffic more easily, but like most (often inaccurate) driver perceptions of enhancing their own safety, it puts pedestrians and people on bikes more at risk.  I don't *want* somebody at the stoplight where I'm crossing the street to be able to reach 60mph in 2.3 seconds.  I don't want that driver making a right turn to be able to lightly tap the pedal and get a big surge of speed.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I was always suspicious of Tesla even a decade ago before Elon Musk completed his mission to make himself look like a crazy idiot in front of the whole world.  As a brand, they've always been more concerned with including lots of distracting high-tech stuff in the cabin and with pushing the limits on acceleration than with helping the environment.\n\nMaybe instead of being in a constant arms race to have the biggest, fastest, heaviest vehicle, manufacturers should be including intelligent speed limiters that use GPS to cut acceleration and top speeds when driving on urban streets.  Except I know they'll never do this because it doesn't make them more money.  (So the government should pass regulations to *make* them do it.)",

      "text": "Insofar as I'm aware the Frikar is the spiffiest enclosed recumbent electric bike in production.  You'd think there'd be at least one spiffy enclosed recumbent bike since at least the invention of plastics since otherwise the necessary tech is all very old.  Someone could've built an electric recumbent bike over a century ago... (for some reason I'm having a hard time finding the first online?).  Since plastics it's been possible to make a lightweight tough transparent bubble to allow sufficient visibility for the operator yet still I can't find a nice podbike to buy.  (Podbikes are also known as velomobiles).\n\nThere are problems with recumbent bikes that've prevented their mass adoption.  Low visibility from being so low to the ground is one.  Elevating the bike to compensate raises the center of gravity and this makes high wind a hazard given the bike's already low weight.  Another problem is being low to the ground means maybe getting splashed with mud/water.  Fully enclosing the vehicle would solve that but not the visibility issue.  But are these problems really so hard to solve?  You're telling me we got the Segway before a spiffy podbike?  I mean... it'd be a clumsy solution but as a last resort why not just make the bike a heavier quad, concentrate the mass/battery as low to the ground as possible to solve stability issues, raise the seat to solve visibility issues, and fully enclose the driver to keep off the mud and the elements?  This may be a deceptively hard machine to optimize but it doesn't seem especially hard to register a sufficiently adequate effort at least to the point of bringing and keeping at least a few of the better efforts on the market.  \n\nThere was the PEBL some years back but customers are saying the PEBL 2.0 isn't shipping as promised.  There's the ELF.  So there have been a few electric recumbent bikes you might actually buy and receive but they've been pricey and amateurish... nothing like what you'd expect of a mature product in a developed market.  For whatever reasons the market for electric recumbent bikes just never developed.  Is the Frikar finally going to change that?\n\nI'm skeptical for one reason.  That reason being that I don't get why a velomobile/podbike should have pedals at all.  Seems like adding pedals introduces unnecessary complexity to the design without being necessary if you're going to make the thing electric anyway.  Nix the pedals from the design requirement and you've got the smallest useful car.  Hence this post could've also been titled \"why can't I find and buy the smallest useful car?\"  You'd think somebody would be making and selling it.  So what gives?",

      "text": "I know I'll never be able to convince people in this sub why cars can be positive aspect to your life, so I'm not going to try. However, I thought, from an enthusiasts point of view and a person that is also a pedestrian in a major metropolitan area, maybe you could benefit from seeing things from my perspective. By way of background, I currently own a Mustang GT and a LR Discovery. I've owned another Land Rover, Mercedes, another Ford, two VWs, an Audi and two Toyotas. The Mustang is by far my favorite.\n\nDownsides to being an enthusiast:\n\n* It can be a rather expensive endeavor. Unless you are very handy and have access to a lift, it is very difficult to solve problems in modern cars if not entirely impossible. I don't mean like changing oil, I mean swapping different components and potentially dealing with electrical issues (NEVER BUY AN AUDI). You have to remember that working on a modern Mercedes, for example, requires specialized tools and experience; when I had my first car, a 1969 VW Beetle, all you really needed was a ratchet set, a wrench, some screwdrivers and a Mr. Pib. \n* Cars are computers now. That means there is a constant drain on the battery when parked. In turn, that means you can't leave your car sitting for more than 7 days with out a line-lead or the battery will drain. So like many (white collar) people I've been working from home during the pandemic, which means I have to take the car out for a good 30 minutes on the weekend just so the alternator will spin and the battery won't die. Because my car uses super premium octane, it means I'm utilizing expensive gas to go in circles (which is wasteful but fun). \n* Fuck cross-over SUVs. The biggest problem enthusiasts have with cross-overs is that they have replaced station wagons in the line up of available cars. Only premium, European manufacturers produce station wagons for export to the U.S. (with the exception of Subaru), so if are like me and prefer to be lower seated in a station wagon you're screwed because only cross-overs are available for a reasonable amount of money. \n* Low gas prices. Right, I said low gas prices. To the extent there is price elasticity to driving, meaning lower prices cause more people on the road, we want high gas prices because it takes people off the road. To put it another way, if I'm already paying $5 per gallon for my BMW 5 series I want to be able to enjoy it. \n* Electric cars. This is two sided. Some people love electric cars for the cultural experience (James May). Some people dislike them because there is no engine sound or car smell (this is why some EV manufacturers put in a fake engine sounds over the speakers). Either way I think it is kind of dumb and am upset that EV owners don't pay gas taxes to support the roads they are driving on.\n\nThat's enough. If there are other people out there who have views or if I have mischaracterized something it would be welcome.",

I am just saying, this tech might at least improve that cars infra.\n\nOf course we do not actually want them bumping into each other and mess with the deliveries , rather all cars are driven by connected computers to smoothen the flow.\n\nBuilding the infrastructure would be a challenge, but we don't have to do it all at once, we can start in zones and keep adding roads to it.\n\nI don't think building attachable compatible vehicles by converting our existing fleet of cars would be a very difficult thing.\n\nFirst and a big part of the challenge would be the Conductive ceilings. An optional second, but highly desired : Hovering , where we could increase efficiency and meanwhile some save rubber as well.\n\nBut if we overcome even the first part, we solve a lot of our problems, right?.\n\n1)Driving automation will take a leap as driving is not required in the zones, all cars can go very fast and striving towards Sig Sigma+ in wrt accident prevention. 2)In the long run , we are done with batteries and fossil fuels , as power is directly from the grid which are already striving to fill with renewables .\n\nWRT Cost: I not sure how much expensive such an infra would be, but most money will go into it would actually building powered ceiling grids and car attachments As I said road redev and hovering tech is optional (IDK?, maybe that is indeed impractical)\n\nSo FuckCars running on oil,gas and degrading minerals , lets switch to grid connected cars at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammer",

      "title": "My Thoughts on Battery Powered Vehicles",
      "text": "I believe battery powered vehicles are a useful technology, but there are some real problems with the technology that are not just oil and gas industry talking points. \n\nFirst electric vehicles are heavily subsidized. There's all sorts of programs such as tax credits that encourage electric vehicle ownership. There's also zev mandates and zev credits. Government subsidies for charging stations. The list goes on. Plus electric vehicles pay no gas or diesel taxes. If we assume that fuel taxes constitute a genuine user fee (which I think they don't), then road subsidies are even more massive for electric vehicles. If we don't assume fuel taxes are a genuine user fee, than subsidies are still pretty high.\n\nAnother issue with batteries is longevity. Batteries only last so long and thus have to be replaced. Batteries often constitute a majority of the cost of electric cars and thus replacing the battery might not be much cheaper than replacing the car. This could theoretically lead to cars becoming more disposable.\n\nBatteries lose significant range in cold weather; this makes battery powered vehicles less usable in cold regions of the world (though not unusable). \n\nCharging times are much higher vs ice vehicles. You can fill a car pretty quickly vs charging. Most \"fast chargers\" only fill up your car in 1 hour or more and many non fast chargers take even longer. Technology will help here but only so much.\n\nBatteries are a really bad solution for cargo due to low energy density. With passengers on buses and cars, the weight is much smaller and thus can get away with batteries. But for freight trains, cargo ships and trucks, batteries are terrible. With existing electric trucks much of the weight is batteries and not cargo. Union Pacific's Electric locomotives are only being used for yard service because of the poor range and capabilities. The best way to electrify cargo is to electrify railways through ground level power and overhead wires and to move more goods via rail. Also importing less goods from abroad.\n\nElectrifying airplanes might not ever be viable due to low energy density of batteries. Maybe hydrogen one day could work. But a good solution here is moving from short haul flights to passenger rail and high speed passenger rail. Another thing is developing maglev technology and making it cost effective.\n\nThe best solution to petroleum dependency is to reduce dependence on transportation that has to carry its own energy. When it comes to cost, energy density and portability, it's hard to beat petroleum. Not only shouldn't we assume abundant hydrocarbons, we shouldn't assume batteries as an easy replacement.",

      "title": "EV Misconceptions",
      "text": "I've noticed quick a few posts on this page which criticize electric vehicles and Tesla's, specifically. As important as it is that we develop and utilize public transportation, there will inevitably be personal automobiles in use for the foreseeable future to at least some extent, and it's critical that those cars are as least impactful as possible. Electric vehicles aren't a solution to car-centric transportation, however, they are a solution to sustainable personable automobile transportation and are less harmful to the environment and can improve public health.\n\nWhile this sub is about discussing the harmful effects of person automobiles, it's extremely important that we don't spread misconceptions and false information about electric vehicles.\n\nLet's go over a few myths that's I've seen here recently:\n\n**1) Electric vehicles are as bad, or worse, for the environment than gas cars**\n\nThis has been proven false by all studies except for one study conducted in Germany which was later debunked. Even in areas where EVs are charged with fossil fuel generated electricity, the emissions are still lower due to the high efficiency of the power plant compared to a gas car, as well as the regenerative breaking of the EV. The manufacturing emissions of the battery are high but the break-even point occurs within only a few years of ownership. [Here is a study specific to Canada](https://www.2degreesinstitute.org/reports/comparing_ghg_emissions_of_bevs_and_icevs.pdf)\n\n**2) Electric vehicles are more dangerous**\n\nDue to the rigidity and weight of the battery, as well as the large crumple zone in most EVs as a result of a small motor in the front (or no motor), EVs are inherently safer. They are more resistant to rolling and perform better in side impact and head on collisions. The car with the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle tested is the [Tesla Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa).\n\n**3) The batteries are unstable and can catch fire**\n\nAccording to the NTSTA \"that the propensity and severity of fires and explosions from the accidental ignition of flammable electrolytic solvents used in Li-ion battery systems are anticipated to be somewhat comparable to or perhaps slightly less than those for gasoline or diesel vehicular fuels.\" According to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/vehiclesafetyreport#:~:text=this%20time%20period.-,2020,every%2019%20million%20miles%20traveled), their vehicles experience a fire at a rate of 1/10th that of a gas car.\n\n**4) The batteries need to be replaced in only a few years**\n\nMost vehicle battery warranties are about 6 to 8 years, however, this does not indicate the batty lifespan. There are many EV batteries that still have plenty of capacity after a half million kilometers. [Tesla batteries have an average retention of 90% after 320 000km.](https://insideevs.com/news/525820/tesla-battery-capacity-retention-90/)\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to comment.",

      "text": "This will mostly deal with utility scale solar and wind energy. You can have solar panels on businesses, apartments and homes, but this has lots of limits. \n\nUtility scale wind and solar effectively and substantially increases the footprint of any urban area. The best solar sources and the best wind sources are generally pretty far away from urban areas. Solar and wind are less energy dense than other energy sources. Solar and wind being less energy dense require substantially greater amounts of land to produce the same amount of energy. Solar and wind also require long power lines for the aforementioned reasons. There's also integrating them effectively in a grid; this can be difficult and require lots of expensive infrastructure.\n\nSolar and wind can't really exist by themselves. Because the sun isn't always shining and the wind isn't always blowing, you have to take this into account. This requires massive amounts of energy storage in the form of batteries or hydrogen or natural gas backups or excess wind.\n\nSolar and wind are interesting technologies, but are insufficient for large urban areas (where mass transit and passenger rail is most effective). Solar and wind are becoming cheaper, but the actual cost of them is not the panels or the wind mills, but all the additional infrastructure costs that are needed on top of the panels and windmills. The best way to go would be nuclear power, hydroelectric and geothermal.  Hydroelectric is mostly developed, but there are places where capacity could be increase and parts of the world where further development is possible. Geothermal contrary to popular belief doesn't require hot springs, and is not as location dependent as most think. Enhanced geothermal technology enables geothermal anywhere there is substantial concentrations of underground heat. Nuclear power is also an option. I avoid talking about hypothetical technologies like thorium, but conventional nuclear power is a proven solution. The main problem with nukes and geothermal is upfront costs. Nukes also take longer to get running. We should work to make better nuclear plants that are standardized, cheaper to build and faster to deploy. According to MIT enhanced geothermal technology could significantly improved with a small of government investment into R&amp;D.",

They won\u0019t fix the urban sprawl and lack of walkable cities and similarly to electric cars only help with the issue of pollution. That being said I still think they are interesting. \n\nSo I first heard about them on Top Gear years ago when James May tried out a hydrogen car and an electric car. He had a lot of problems with the electric cars battery life and how long it took to charge and no problems at all with the hydrogen car. The only issue with them was one they both shared, there was no infrastructure supporting them. \n\nSince then, Tesla has poured tons of time and money and research into fixing those two problems with electric cars and infrastructure supporting electric cars has started showing up making them a viable option in a limited sense. But it has also revealed new problems like the environmental destructiveness of mining for lithium and how there isn\u0019t enough lithium in the world to completely replace all ICE cars. Hydrogen doesn\u0019t have these problems or the need to fix the others yet I\u0019ve heard nothing about them in the years since. \n\nAre there major issues (besides cost and lack of infrastructure) with hydrogen cars I don\u0019t know about or is it just that no narcissistic billionaire made them their pet project so they didn\u0019t get a bunch of public awareness and support?",

      "text": "Energy companies are currently investing huge sums into social media campaigns to push nuclear. Why?\n\nMany renewable sources cut them out of the market. Roof solar doesn't need a huge company to run. Wind parks could theoretically, but in practice they're usually run by investment companies that just contract out maintenance.\n\nWhy do we care if it fights climate change? Because it doesn't do it in time or economically.\n\n1. Nuclear plants take way too long to go online. Sure, we could build them quickly in the 60-80's. Well-funded \"energy initiatives\" push those numbers to trick you by pretending the average construction time back then is representative of how long it would take today. This is how it looks nowadays: [link with recent examples from Scandinavia and France](http://euanmearns.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-nuclear-power-plant/) [link with MIT study on why projections are very far off](https://energy.mit.edu/news/building-nuclear-power-plants/) 10-15 years. They're literally irrelevant to fighting the climate crisis in a reasonable time frame.\n\n2. Nuclear is not cost competitive with renewables anymore. Remember from the link above that projected upfront costs for reactors today tend to be exceeded by 100%-200% ? That upfront cost is the main driver of nuclear energy prices per watt. The projected prices are way off.\n\n2. Bridge technology? They need many decades to pay back their huge upfront cost. That makes them laughably unsuitable as a \"bridge technology\". If we have this huge upfront sum to invest, maybe we should invest it in technology that will actually be ready in time?\n\nThe argument for nuclear made sense 10 years ago (or before that).

      "text": "Driving consists of turning a steering wheel, pressing pedals, and letting fossil fuels / batteries do the heavy work. The fact that some car models are marketed as \"sporty\" makes a mockery of traditional sports like basketball, running, archery, etc.\n\nNot only that, if you drive in a sporty way on public roads, like exceeding speed limits, accelerating/decelerating/turning suddenly, you are almost certainly creating unnecessary hazards and putting bystanders at risk. Let's be real here, not many people actually go out of their way to use racetracks on private land.\n\nTo make things worse, many sports cars owners choose to modify their exhaust to be extra loud, creating noise pollution for pedestrians, residents, and shoppers nearby. It seems to me that asserting dominance is a big part of the sports car culture.\n\nWant to be sporty? Get on a bike, any bike. A stationary exercise bike, a beater commuter bike, a road bike. Your so-called sports car only makes a negative impression on me.",

      "text": "I have some driving I haven't been able to factor out of my workflow yet and so this morning I decided to do a good faith analysis of buying a used EV for my next car (assuming I'm not able to figure out a non-driving solution before then).\n\nBased on 30mpg of my current car and 110mpge of the new HYUNDAI Ioniq 6 Long range RWD, the math is pretty clear on the fuel savings:\n\nIf I drive 9,000 mi/yr then the annual fuel cost of my current car at $3.50/gl will be \\~$3,150. The Ioniq 6, with its 77kwh battery, at $0.10/kwh will require \\~$7.70 to fully charge; so its annual fuel cost will be \\~$656. This nets me a fuel savings of \\~$2,500/yr.\n\nSounds good so far, right? Well to buy a used Ioniq 6, they're around $32,000 in good condition, and for the sake of being the most charitable (and simplifying the math), let's say after selling my current car and getting a good deal in the used market I get one for $25,000.\n\nAssuming all of that, the car should theoretically pay for itself in fuel savings after 10 years. But now here's the \"gotcha\" that makes me think this is all a scam. Apparently these batteries need to be replaced about every 10 years, and the cost of a new battery seems to be about $20,000 - $30,000... which would be the entire cost of the savings.\n\nSo to the EV proponents out there; what am I missing? How is this not a scam?\n\nI truly don't get it.",

(Also before you call me a boomer that doesn't care about the environment I am 21)\n\nI jut wanted to discuss about some things that I think you guys don't consider.\n\nFor example I really enjoy driving, sometimes I just go for a drive for the fun of it, I understand that some people, probably including all the people here, don't like it but there are a lot of people that actually enjoy going for a drive: just you, some music and the road...\n\nAlso I read about many people talking about the pollution cars make and I totally agree with that, cars are a big source of pollution however as it stands right now we don't have anything better, you can say that electric cars exist and honestly I can't wait until all the cars on the road will be electric but they just aren't there yet. They take too long to charge, they are extremally expensive and batteries are less energy dense than fuel so they take more space and they are heavier. This last point doesn't matter too much on cars however it's very important with other kinds of transportation like planes and boats.\n\nAnd I would like to conclude that public transport and bicycles aren't the future either. Let's start with bicycles: they are way slower than cars, if you need to travel a big distance you are going to get to the destination exhausted (and smelly), if you dress nice to go to work your clothes might get ruined, if it rains you are in big troubles and there is always the risk of falling off.\n\nPublic transport on the other hand is fairly unreliable. First you need to walk to the closest bus or train station, even if it's raining, then you need to wait a bunch of time depending on how often your bus comes around, usually 10 minutes (excluding all the times busses get canceled or incompetent drivers skip the stop), then if it's peak hour you probably need to stand for the whole trip in a vehicle packed with other people and once you arrive you still need to walk to your destination. And don't even get me started when halfway through the trip the bus driver needs to swap and the new driver is late. Basically you are paying more than you would pay for fuel for a trip that takes probably 5 times longer and doesn't even drop you off in front of your destination.\n\nNow BEFORE YOU GO IN THE COMMENTS, I have to say that cars aren't perfect either, not considering the pollution you still need to find a parking spot near your destination (which might not be an issue if you have dedicated parking at your office), you need to pay for insurance, registration, fuel, and then if something brakes it's a lot of money however for many people they are the fastest and most enjoyable way to get around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Cars might not be perfect but other methods of transportations have their problems.",

      "text": "I recently rented a car (had to go to a wedding on an evening, no usable public transit to get there, unless I changed trains 4 times, for a hundred km - not worth it)\n\nIt was on a Saturday evening, so I could only bring the car back on the Monday morning. Gave me a whole day to use it, and therefore to charge it, so I chose an electric car. I\u0019ll come back to it in a moment.\n\nHaving full access to a car, on-demand, made me understand why carbrains say cars are freedom. Because it does feel like that.\nOf course I am but too aware of the issues and costs of a car, so I could tamper the feeling. But anyone in car culture will not. They will only feel that \"freedom\" which comes with their car.\n\nNote that one could feel similar with a bike, but my experience here got exacerbated by how I didn\u0019t have access to a bike at the moment (on vacation).\n\nAs for the electric car - compared to a gas car. Super fun to drive, ngl. On sunday, while I was looking for a charger, I tried the acceleration on an empty parking lot. Blissful and exhilarating experience. Such a pain in the ass to charge though.\n\nI had a small car (Peugeot e208), 50kWh battery. Fully charging it on the wall outlet would have taken 50h, so I went to find a charger. What a nightmare. Not only is it not that much cheaper than gas for a fuel-efficient vehicle, but you must give up your privacy to charge your car. It\u0019s not like the gas pump, you have to use a website to pay, and enter your email address, when it doesn\u0019t force you to create an account and store your credit card info on their server.\n\nIn the end, 5/10. If I don\u0019t have to deal with the charge, I\u0019ll happily rent an electric car again (if I need a car ofc).\n\nIf I ever get a car, it will be a station wagon or minivan, when I\u0019ll have at least 4 children (or maybe 3, trains don\u0019t usually have 5/6-seat spaces), and it will be a diesel, only used to carry the family across the country on vacation, or to bring absurd amounts of shit to the recycling plant.",

      "text": "As a non-American I'm shocked by the fact you can't get to literally any place in the country by train. My city is literally based around public transport and despite the fact the car road system is decent as well and both of them being constantly upgraded, owning a car here is controversial at best and unreasonable at worst.\n\nIn my city of Moscow I can get literally anywhere on the map in 30 min from the center within city limits (and Moscow ain't a small city), 50-60 within close to mid suburban. It takes around 50 minutes to get from the northern border to the southern and vice versa. 85% of city limits are reachable by metro + 5-15 min walk, for further places busses course regularly (mostly EV ones). Also there are plenty of alternative public transportation as well like trams, trolleys, suburban trains (my personal favorite), monorail, a few cable car routes and recently even river trams were proposed. And for those rare occasions where you absolutely need a personal car there's a very extensive car sharing service starting from 12 RUB/min (about 19 cents). \n\nTaxis are also very numerous and cheap, a ride on a Polo/Rio/Solaris class across the city border to border will cost you about 600-800 rub (10-15 bucks) depending on current demand. Better vehicles like Passat/Optima/Sonata will be around 20 bucks, and for 50+ you'll ride the s-class like a chad. A single universal ticket for metro/buss/train/tram costs 55 rub (about 85 cents), a card for a week or more will be like twice as cheap per ride. This is much much more economic than having your own car, especially when you take parking prices, gas etc. into the account. \n\nI'm 22 y. o. and I can't even imagine myself owning a car without a solid reason like having 3+ kids or a personal business or a job somewhere unreachable by other transport and even then 2/3 cases an alternative like a car sharing or taxi would be better and cheaper in long term. \n\nThe point is when the city has a proper public transportation system, cars become obsolete and irrelevant, and because of that mayor administration plans to close the city center for cars entirely by 2030 and even now about 30-40% of streets are pedestrian only and parking prices within the historical center are outrageous. \n\nMy hot take is that cars should be regulated like guns are (edit: like in EU or here in Russia), so in order to get one you'd have to go through multiple examinations, mandatory extreme driving classes for better driving skills in extreme situations, get a special permission from the city, and of course be taxed minimum twice the value as well as spare parts for them. Gas should be taxed even more, minimum 80% of its price being excise price tax, like cigarettes and booze. The state should discourage new car purchases by all means necessary, personal transport in a modern city is simply an unnecessary luxury and should be treated as such.\n\nEVs and hybrids are just as bad unless you're planning to use them for 10+ years and don't change your battery even once, because otherwise you're not only not reducing emissions and pollution but increasing it, it's just being released elsewhere. Don't fool yourself.",

      "text": "&gt;Following is a translated conversation from September 2007 with transport scientist Hermann Knoflacher who even in the hayday of the car saw it's destructive potential and did his best to minimize it. While a bit long it's definitely worth it. He is an OG! \n\n*DIE ZEIT: Do you reject the car?*\n\nHermann Knoflacher: I don't reject the car. But I am aware of what it means for our society.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you drive a car yourself?*\n\nKnoflacher: I don't own one, but I do drive myself from time to time.\n\n*ZEIT: What influence does motorization have on our society?*\n\nKnoflacher: An incredible influence. The car is like a virus that takes root in the brain and totally reverses the code of conduct, value system and perception. A normal person would describe our current living space as totally insane! We retreat more or less voluntarily into sealed houses with soundproof windows to leave the outside space to the noise, dust and exhaust fumes of the cars. That's a complete reversal of values that we don't even notice anymore.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you think this came about?*\n\nKnoflacher: Our problem is the upright gait. We need a relatively large amount of muscle and control energy to stabilize our bodies. Think of the difficulty of movement under the influence of alcohol. In the car, we use only one-sixth of our body energy and have the impression of being insanely fast and strong. That is one component. The other is the requirement for urban planning to accommodate the car in close proximity to all activities. In doing so, one destroys the natural habitat, public transport, local supply and ultimately also the social network that man has built up over thousands of years.\n\n*ZEIT: The car destroys evolution?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, but the human achievements of the last generations have been destroyed by the car.\n\n*ZEIT: Does the age of the car mean our cultural downfall?*\n\nKnoflacher: I wouldn't say that, because in my opinion cultural decline is not really a problem. It is only a very late evolutionary layer that is breaking away. Much worse are the ongoing structural destructions caused by the car.\n\n*ZEIT: Is driving an addiction?*\n\nKnoflacher: Absolutely! The car takes possession of people. After all, the car driver is more different from the human being than any insect.\n\n*ZEIT: What do you mean by that?*\n\nKnoflacher: Insects have in common with humans that they manage mobility with their own bodily energy. Drivers don't have to. And there are no insects that destroy the habitat of their offspring out of convenience or move so fast that they kill themselves in the process.\n\n*ZEIT: How mobile do you think a society should be?*\n\nKnoflacher: Every society must be mobile in order to satisfy its needs. If we could fulfill all our needs locally, we would be plants, not people. Human mobility always arises as a result of a local deficiency.\n\n*ZEIT: Why are we proud of our mobility?*\n\nKnoflacher: You are talking about technical mobility. Historically, we were by no means proud of mobility per se. On the contrary, mobility was always a ballast. Becoming sedentary meant liberation from forced mobility. One was mentally mobile enough to know how to grow plants and domesticate animals.\n\n*ZEIT: Is that why terms like gypsy or tramp are swear words?*\n\nKnoflacher: It's clear: the sedentary have conquered their territory and denied entry to anyone else. Sedentarism works on the principle of exclusivity. The nomads dispute the sedentary people's spatial resources and are hated for it.\n\n*ZEIT: You are a critic of transportation and at the same time a planner. How\ndoes that fit together?*\n\nKnoflacher: At the beginning of my career, I discovered that traditional transportation is based on mere assumptions. For a long time, the consequences for society or ecology were not even considered. No one paid attention to whether noise or exhaust problems would arise, whether people would die, whether the economy would be changed, or whether unemployment would be created. My goal is to put transportation planning on a scientific basis. From this point of view, I consider transportation to be one of the most exciting scientific fields that currently exist.\n\n*ZEIT: You criticize the lack of networking between transport planning and\nother disciplines.*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes. The core theses of transportation are, in my opinion, completely wrong! The idea of mobility growth is based on an incomplete view of the system. It was assumed that mobility would increase as motorization increased. In the meantime, however, we know that only the number of car trips is increasing, but the total number of trips made remains the same, because trips by public transport and walking are decreasing at the same time. The second false assumption is that of saving time by increasing speed. This thesis forms the basis of many economic efficiency calculations in transportation planning. In fact, there is no time saving by higher speeds. Only the distances increase for the same travel time.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you prove something like that?*\n\nKnoflacher: By taking a critical look at the human time budget. Interestingly, the time spent daily on mobility is more or less constant around the globe. However, the distances covered vary. In the 1960s, the philosopher Ivan Illich demonstrated that the amount of energy humans invest in the car and its associated infrastructure would be sufficient to cover the same distance on foot - and in a much nicer and quieter environment. We know that higher speeds don't save any real time!\n\n*ZEIT: But doesn't a society's mobility increase when it covers greater\ndistances?*\n\nKnoflacher: No. Quite the opposite. The additional distance is pointless. Man covers the greater distances to satisfy the same needs as before. He does the same thing as before, only he travels farther to do it.\n\n*ZEIT: But we are expanding our horizons.*\n\nKnoflacher: How is the horizon supposed to expand if I speed past my surroundings at 100 kilometers per hour? You narrow your horizon extremely because of the fast movement!\n\n*ZEIT: You perceive different things when you go on vacation to India instead\nof Bavaria.*\n\nKnoflacher: It doesn't depend on where you go, but what you discover there. You don't experience more on a well-trodden tourist path in India than in Bavaria. On the contrary, with vigilance and curiosity, you can discover things in Bavaria that you won't find in India. Speeds, which exceed our evolutionary grown possibilities, also exceed our perception. We are not mentally able to cope with the distances that we have made technically possible.\n\n*ZEIT: But we feel powerful.*\n\nKnoflacher: Of course. Mobility always means power. Studies show, by the way, that parents do not consider their own children when they have to choose between a parking space in front of their front door and a traffic-calmed zone. The restriction of movement, even the danger of death for their own offspring, is consciously accepted when it comes to finding the closest possible parking space.\n\n*ZEIT: Is driving a car completely crazy?*\n\nKnoflacher: Considering the conditions that man has created for himself for his car, driving a car is clearly the most pleasant form of mobility and therefore quite rational. In comparison, just look at the movement infrastructure of pedestrians. Sidewalks in their current form are a joke! In the past, pedestrians were allowed to occupy the entire street surface - for 7000 years! Over the last 50 years we have marginalized the pedestrian and wonder why this form of mobility is disappearing. We have built structures that force people to drive!\n\n*ZEIT: Are we living in a dictatorship of car drivers?*\n\nKnoflacher: Absolutely!\n\n*ZEIT: Can this be changed?*\n\nKnoflacher: Of course. It would be enough to change the organization of parking spaces. If, on your way to park your car, you pass a public transport stop or a store - which would automatically locate itself - the need to drive would decrease. These days, you torture people with symptom heresy. You collect a little parking fee here, a little toll there. That's totally unfair. First you build structures that encourage people to use their cars, and then you charge them. As a planner, you have to create transportation structures that free people from the compulsion to drive!\n\n*ZEIT: That sounds like a job full of conflict.*\n\nKnoflacher: At the time, people predicted that my idea of making Kärntnerstrasse in Vienna a pedestrian zone would mean its economic death. Later, I was told that cycling was completely unattractive to the Viennese and that speeding up public transport by paving stops would cause an uprising among car drivers. Supposedly, everything was unpopular. Yet the Viennese embraced these ideas, and the city's quality of life has risen in international rankings. You can't always just satisfy voters' wishes. After all, you don't give tax-free drugs to drug addicts, although this wish would certainly exist.\n\n*ZEIT: In your opinion, can the problem be solved through the price of\ngasoline?*\n\nKnoflacher: No! Any increase in the price of gasoline is a purely symptomatic treatment and automatically leads into the social trap. If only the rich can afford gasoline and the poor can't, the traffic problem remains unsolved, and a social injustice is added. You have to start with the parking space and the way to get there. If parking space is organized properly, car-free areas with a high quality of life will be created. Those who want to sleep peacefully will just have to walk further to the car. And those who prefer the car have to live where it is noisy and smelly. Car parking spaces must be organized in the same way as public transport stops.\n\n*ZEIT: You advocate more parking bans?*\n\nKnoflacher: There you see how car-indoctrinated you think. If pedestrians are forbidden to cross a street where they want to, that is quite normal. A reorganization of traffic zones into pedestrian and car areas is demonized as a ban on cars, without thinking about the fact that this separation offers the best solution.\n\n*ZEIT: What about the much-vaunted freedom of the motorist?*\n\nKnoflacher: That is a purely virtual freedom that is sold via advertising. An empty country road is shown in beautiful surroundings, with a single car speeding around. If the reality of traffic with traffic jams were shown, no one would be stupid enough to buy a car.\n\n*ZEIT: Cars still sell very well.*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes, because car drivers also enjoy another kind of freedom, a legal freedom. Unlike everyone else, they are allowed to make noise and pollute the environment and endanger public safety with impunity. A rampaging drunk will be arrested for noise pollution, motorists who blast our homes at all hours of the day and night will be accepted. If I were to spray carcinogenic substances as a pedestrian with a can, it would be against the law. Thousands of car drivers do this every day without hindrance and shorten the lifespan of all of us by an average of twelve years.\n\n*ZEIT: The car driver is a killer?*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes, but not out of malicious intent. The car puts us into a space-time structure of irresponsibility that we can neither comprehend nor cope with. And it has a strong lobby: The car industry, the construction industry, even the banks that grant loans for car purchases, take great care to ensure that studies like the one just mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) are not published.\n\n\n*ZEIT: Even teenagers dream of cars.*\n\nKnoflacher: Because they have experienced years of lack of freedom by riding in them. A child's mobility is radically restricted by the car. They are not allowed to walk to or across the street, they are not allowed to play everywhere, they are locked into the narrow rear of a car for hours on end, and they are also strapped in. Clearly, teens can't wait to regain their freedom with a driver's license and a car of their own.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you think cars cause wars?*\n\nKnoflacher: One hundred percent! And you don't even have to look at Iraq. Here, too, there is a permanent war. In Austria, two people are killed on the road every day. Traffic causes physical damage to 40,000 people every year. And that doesn't even include those who die as a result of exhaust fumes, according to the WHO.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you feel when you drive past suburban shopping centers,\nfurniture markets and similar facilities?*\n\nKnoflacher: They are parasites! I feel sorry for any city with such structures. After all, the traffic problem is, among other things, a child of such shopping centers and furniture stores on the outskirts of the city. The main problem is the huge free parking spaces. They should be taxed so heavily that parking there costs the same as in the city center. Everyone should be allowed to build where they want, but it can't be right that business people in the city centers have to struggle with parking fees while everything is provided for free on the outskirts.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you think that in ten years Europe's cities will look like the much\nderided U.S. cities with their extensive suburban single-family zones, huge\nshopping centers and few public transportation options?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, because reurbanization is currently taking place in many cities in Europe. This also has to do with the aging of the population. Old people can't get the service on the outskirts of the city that they get in the center. They simply have to return to the city. Apart from that, the energy issue will force people to move back to the cities.\n\n*ZEIT: You mean the price of gasoline?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, I mean the price of energy in general. This will certainly increase and have a decisive impact on all areas of life. This applies to heating, power supply, transportation - and all of this has a much greater impact in terms of insulation in a single-family home on the outskirts of town than in the city center. And older people need many energy-intensive services that become very expensive when prices rise. I'm not just thinking of \"meals on wheels\" or similar services. The more sprawled people live, the more energy is required. And we will soon no longer be able to afford that. That means we have to create sustainable urban structures now in order to be able to finance the future. Because the current cities with their marginal settlements are definitely not that.\n\n*ZEIT: Is it true that the social costs of mobilization are higher than the\nprofits, which include jobs in the automotive industry?*\n\nKnoflacher: That is absolutely true. And the bill will get even worse for consumers, because at the moment mobility is more or less free, and that will soon change dramatically.\n\n*ZEIT: Why are air travelers now suddenly being criticized in relation to\nmobility and climate protection, and not car drivers?*\n\nKnoflacher: First of all, the harmful effects of air travel are not insignificant and the criticism is justified. This is also due to the fact that low-cost airlines activate passenger groups that would otherwise not be found in air travel. Basically, flying is the most degrading form of transportation of all. Flying always reminds me of factory farming: chickens in a laying battery being fed off. Unlike the people on the plane, at least the chickens are not strapped in.\n\n&gt; Professor Hermann Knoflacher has been teaching at the Institute of Transport Planning and Traffic Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology for more than 30 years. The 67-year-old became known for his concepts for Vienna. He developed pedestrian zones, put streetcars on tracks and proposed a network of cycle paths.\n\nThanks to /u/Alexander_Selkirk for posting it to /r/fahrrad and DeepL for translating.",

      "title": "\u001cI\u0019m sick and tired of the same excuses drivers come up with to continue burning gasoline and on a warming planet\u001d - A Fix It Post",
      "text": "I was initially going to parody the post by someone with a post of the same name, but then I decided to actually be constructive and propose some reasonable, non-preachy answers to the guy\u0019s excuses.\n\nTo preface though, any actions one takes alone will mean nothing without collective action, especially with those outside this subreddit and are at best lukewarm to a future not dominated by cars. \n\n\"My emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d\n\nThis is true, but that doesn\u0019t reduce our personal responsibility. This mindset is a killer of positive change in many areas, voting and littering as examples. We can\u0019t stop the bad individually, but we can reduce the harm.\n\nMake sure to stay involved in all levels of government though. If there\u0019s something local to you pumping out emissions, chances are they have to deal with some level of your local government, and you can influence that too, especially if you\u0019re part of a group.\n\n\"I can't afford an electric car.\"\n\nHave you looked into federal subsidies? They can help bring the price down as a customer.\n\nThere are other options though. Hybrids are a decent middle ground, plenty of used ones out there at this point. Try to use the battery as often as you can. \n\n\"I don't have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\"\n\nHave you sat down and tried to plot out a public transit or bike route to/from work? It could be better than you think.\n\nIf public transit is prohibitive due to infrequent appearances or prohibitive travel times, try car pooling with co-workers. It\u0019s still a car on the road, but in total it\u0019s at least one less car that needs to go to/from your work place.\n\n\"Driving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\"\n\nHow significant is the time? If it\u0019s less than 15 more minutes each way, is it really that much better? \n\nIf it\u0019s an hour\u0019s difference or you need to get to another job soon after, then that\u0019s a pass.\n\n\"There's no infrastructure to bike where I live.\"\n\nThat can\u0019t be helped in the moment. High speed roads are especially dangerous to bikers even without assholes gunning for you and you shouldn\u0019t risk your life daily for an intangible future.\n\nTry to find likeminded folk though and pressure whatever local governments to address this need for the community.\n\n\"My workplace is out of reach of biking\ndistance.\"\n\nAforementioned carpooling and plotting public transit routes. \n\nSee if it\u0019s possible to bring a bike with you on public transit to fill in gaps on your trips/make it so you don\u0019t have to bike the whole way.\n\nYou can also try asking to work from home, if it\u0019s an option at your workplace and role.\n\n\"I'm too weak to bike.\"\n\nIf you can\u0019t bike for whatever health reasons, then what you need to do to survive is not your fault. Causing yourself to suffer daily for an intangible goal is only going to worsen both your physical and mental health.\n\nAgain though, look into carpooling. A car off the road for whatever reason is a car not creating emissions or at risk of causing an accident\n\n\"I can't carry my groceries on a bike.\"\n\nThere are carriages that can be purchased and towed by a bicycle.\n\nAlternatively, try to line up multiple errands to be done at once and purchase non-perishable items in bulk to reduce your overall number of car trips. Making a list of what you need/are running low on can really help with this.\n\n\"I can't ride a bike in the cold.\"\n\nTry layering up, but don\u0019t kill yourself trying to make it work. There\u0019s a reason there are days we\u0019re told we shouldn\u0019t drive in X weather conditions, and bikes are more susceptible to the whims of the weather.\n\n\"Not everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\"\n\nIt doesn\u0019t have to be a traditional bike. There are other electric or man powered personal vehicles with additional wheels for stabilization.\n\n\"I don't like waiting for the bus.\"\n\nSee the aforementioned carpooling and plotting of a route. \n\nAlso, there are ways to keep ourselves entertained alone now.\n\nAgain, if it\u0019s a significant burden on your time due to public transit being poor, then do what you have to do. Just be sure to take action where you can to rectify it rather than wallow in the misfortune.\n\n\"I don't like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d\n\nAnother fair reason. Germaphobia, claustrophobia, or just a general unease or fear of strangers is a reasonable reason not to take public transit. Do be sure to investigate all your other options before resigning yourself to a personal car though.\n\n\"How can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\"\n\nSee the aforementioned question on the grocery store.\n\n\n\nWe all here know the climate of Earth is changing fast in ways that are unfavorable to life as it currently exists. Radical action needs to be taken to avert the worst effects. Significant changes need to be forced from the top, and society\u0019s not going to go cold turkey on cars tomorrow, but there are a lot of small things that can be done to address the issue, especially when we take action collectively. \n\nWe\u0019re only going to get other people to work with us if we listen and genuinely address their concerns, rather than dismissing them as excuses. We\u0019re not personal trainers, they aren\u0019t coming to us for help; we\u0019re coming to them and so we need to speak on their terms.\n\nEdited to remove a name.",

      "title": "The ÖBB Nightjet towards Berlin. An \"exciting\" experience. ",
      "text": "Sometime in October 2023. The early stages of planing a family trip. Where shall it go? Wales. And Liverpool. 8 days. Lets split them 50/50. \n\nWhos comming? 10 people. Family and close friends between the ages of 8 and 59. \n\nSo what form of transport shall we use? \nPlane? Bad for the climate. So its out. \n\nCar? We cant travel together in one. We would only meet on the ferry. So where is the fun? \n\nSo the train it is. Lets check the trains. There is a new nighttrain from Brussels to Berlin and back that stops in a convenient place on the way back. So lets take that one. Said and done. Everyone books a space of their desired category. Pricey if you want something to lay down on but it replaces a hotel. Or so some thought. \n\n\nHalf a year later: The journey home begins. In the north of wales after a nice holiday, 10 people board an Avanti Westcoast to London. Its late, but we get into the eurostar check-in with like 2 Minutes of spare time. Of to Brussels. \n\nBrussels, the same day but in the late afternoon\nThe group is still fully present, waiting for the nightjet.\n\"Nightjet\"\nA name that many of us connected with exciting destinations. Somewhat comfy night journeys. And a desireable way of sleeping in a train. Well, at least till that evening. \n\nThe train rolling in is on time. It is realy dirty from the outside but hey, dont judge a book from its cover. Or a train in that instance. \nMy greedy as booked a seat, not some form of laydown cabin. I am just a student, so money is tight and I can sleep quite well in trainseats. Those of the ICEs and ICs that roll around in germany at least. Also, sleeping on UK trains went quite well. \nBut this? This is something else. The seats of this carriage got some serious milage. The fabric is worn, at some areas the baselayer is visibale. Same goes for the seat aswell. Seat comfort? Not much. \nThe cabin is dirty. There is all sorts of grime, the door was tagged with some marker quite some time ago. It already wore of from opening and closing the door. \nOver the day I drank out my water. There was no time in london or bruxilles to refill it. So I wanna go to the on-train shop that was advertised on the paper laying in the cabin.\nSurprise: It doesnt exist. I only found out by asking other travelers. I should ask the service conductor but he doesnt realy have suplies to sell to the seat part of the train they tell me. I went looking for the guy but didnt find him. Maybe he doesnt exist aswell. Who knows... \nThe kid of the family, who is traveling in the same cabin, is a bit sad because I promissed her to get her a coke from the nonexistent shop. \n\nI go back to the cabin. My family helped me out with water. I check my phone. The battery is at 20%, better charge it. There are outlets. They have one of those securitysystems that require a bit of force to plug into. The left one works, someones charger is on there already. The right one? Chhhrrrk. Turned my working phone charger into... well at least not that. Gotta visit Saturn tomorrow. \n\nSigh. At least I have a small powerbank with me that is charged up. \n\nChhhrrrrk. I look around. The kid in the cabin starts laughing. Her dad adjusted his seat a while ago. Seems like the mechanism is broken because now he is in the middle of the cabin and the seat is flat. One could say its karma that the same thing happens to the kid only 5 minutes later. \n\nWell, time to check on the family. Maybe ÖBB just saved on the seat part of the train. The cheap part anyway. \n\nThe 4 oldest people of the group booked the higher lever sleeping carts. They got one cabin with a devider in the middle. The devider is broken. The sticker saying its broken looks oddly familiar. But I have never been on an ÖBB train. Weird. But remeber that for later.\nOther than that, the cabins have a somewhat welcoming 90s flair. But not in a bad way.\n\nAnother part of the group is a family with 3 kids. They booked a lower level sleeping car. 6 beds in one cabin. They already folded open the beds when I looked around. They are very pleased with their cabin. The dad says that its okay value for the money they paid. \n\nBack to the high level cabin. The \"conductors helper\" comes around to fold open the beds. Well. The bed is stained with coffee. It wasnt cleaned after the last service, the sheets havent been changed. The look on his face only shows that its not the first time this has happend. He starts looking around the cabins for extra sheets and services the cabin. Eventually things will be sorted. The ones that booked the cabin are pissed. The \"broken\" door just has servely missaligned doors due to wear in the joins. They unlock it and kick it into place. Works. Looking at the door, they were not the first people who did this. \n\nBack to my cart. \"This cant be it\" I think. The glorious nightjet. An illusion? Are all of these this bad? And if yes, why are they still around? \n\nI look outside. The station of the city I grew up in comes by. Oh if I only had the key to my parents flat with me. I would exit and sleep there. But I dont. \n\nI start googleing. Where do these old carts on this new connection come from? \n\nPretty easy answer. Deutsche Bahn. And thats also why I recognized the sticker. Its a DB one. DB has cancelled its night train programme some time ago and  ÖBB bought the 30 year old railcars. And put them right back into service. Some blinds where changed and some wrap was put on the outside but inside they look just about as 90s as they are. Just like those old IC cars with the folding doors that I found fascinating as a child. It all comes together. But ÖBB? Nah. This is something that barely deserves the name \"flixtrain\". For the dumping prices they run for, this experience might be okay. But not for what we paid. Not at all. \n\nBut we are here. Onwards. In 2 digit speeds through germany. Taking twice as long as the ICE because reasons. Probably because cheap railslots. \nTrying to get some sleep while hoping that the frame, brakes and axles are in better condition than the inside of this train. Because if not, it defnetly has some souls to sell.

I will usually only drive in the weekend, and even then there are often 2 or 3 weeks (or more) in a row where we don't drive at all. When my cargo bike arrives we'll use them even less (and probably sell one of mine)\n\nAnd now to my point. Fuck the nitwit who designed modern cars with so much parasitic power draw. These stupids things starting batteries go flat in a couple of weeks, even with a brand new battery, and unless you always put the battery maintainer on it means the battery is completely stuffed after 12-18 months.\n\nThey are really not designed for people who like to have them for weekend adventures, but otherwise use other transportation.",

      "text": "Hi all,  \n\n\nAs the title says, I'm looking to get an e-bike but am pretty much a newbie to the topic. For some background: I'm in Ontario, Canada, and the city I'm in has pretty trash public transit (Comes once an hour to where I live, sometimes late, sometimes just not at all) and a lot of the barriers to owning a car that affect many in this subreddit apply to me.   \n\n\n I'd like to get an e-bike so I can have some agency to get place/people without the massive timesink of transit (plus the COVID risk, since I live with multiple people who are either immunocompromised or work with vulnerable populations).  \n\n\nSo... where should I start? What do I need (besides the usual bike lock and helmet, of course)? What are the brands/shops to look for or avoid? A couple of relevant qualifiers below:  \n\n\n\\- I took a look at Google Maps, and to get from where I am to the far end of the nearest city caps out at about 50km. I don't know if finding an e-bike with a battery capacity of 100km is excessive, but I thought I'd put that as a ceiling on what I'd \"need\".  \n\\- I just got laid off from my job. Between my last pay/severance, I've budgeted out about $3k CAD (I could push 4k, but I'd like not to if I can).  \n\\- Do you buy a charger WITH the bike? Does it come with one? Do you need any special equipment in your home (I do live in a detached house, so have some measure of control over things) to do it, or things that represent additional cost?  \n\n\nThanks to everyone for your help in advance! Any insight you could provide would be greatly appreciated. :)",

      "title": "We need carrots *and* sticks",
      "text": "I've seen some comments on this sub that say essentially that we shouldn't focus on sticks because they aren't as effective as carrots, but I beg to differ. I live in Philly. There's very little if any traffic enforcement here. Our parking authority doesn't ticket anyone parked in bike lanes, although I've heard reports they are starting to crack down on it in Center City. Still, it's much more needed in the less affluent areas because that's where most of the parking violations occur. I know, the bike lanes are much sketchier in less affluent areas, which is an argument for carrots, but even if we had grade separated bike lanes, drivers here park on sidewalks all the time. My neighbors and I have taken to putting planters on our sidewalk because drivers routinely park on our sidewalk. Even then, drivers move our planters and park there. PPA does nothing about it. Plus, we have a ton of drivers running red lights. Yesterday, I saw a driver run the red with a cop car right behind them. Then, the cop also ran the red without pulling them over. There were no lights or sirens, nothing to indicate there was an emergency. Police here, after this bill was passed that prohibited them from using things like broken tail lights to racially profile people, have decided not to enforce anything. And the people here also argue against red light cameras, but police can't be everywhere all the time, nor would I want them to be. Yesterday, I was coming home from a group ride and was pretty close to home, riding down a residential street. I came to an intersection where I had the green light, and I proceeded through because it was green and cross traffic was stopped. The second I entered the intersection, the car that was stopped ran their red light and gunned it at me. Philly residential streets aren't typically wide like residential streets in much of the US, so there wasn't anything about the street that signaled it was safe to drive like a maniac. Plus, it seemed intentional. If people knew that any light could have a camera in it, I think they'd be less likely to run red lights. I'm all for carrots. Use as many of them as possible, but I don't think we should neglect using sticks. \n\nP.S. That driver scared the shit out of me. I was on a bike, so they could have seriously injured me had I not been able to swerve and miss them by inches, and even if my camera battery hadn't died, there's nobody I could have reported it to and honestly expected any consequences to be dealt.",

      "title": "Literally... Trains!",
      "text": "So, given the climate and ecological crisis that we're facing, and how our governments aren't doing jack sh\\*t to combat it. I thought I would share with you some positive insights about how we already *have* the technology to mitigate some of the worse effects of the climate crisis. And how we don't need some fancy \"Tech Bro\" miracle gadgetbahn technology, but rather, use an existing and proven technology that we already have by just implementing it correctly.\n\nAnd the solution is Quite Literally... Trains!\n\nLets start with fuel/power:\n\nMost greenhouse gas emissions, at least in the transportation sector are from cars, planes, and ships, with trains accounting for less than 5%. This is due to many trains being electric power, gaining their energy from the grid via overhead wires, third rail, and hopefully in the future, contactless power transmission.\n\nThere's no need for large batteries that can catch fire, whose manufacturing is terrible for the environment, not to mention the [child-labor](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara) and exploitations.\n\nBy gaining their energy *externally* through the power grid and not needing to carry their own power, so long as the power plants are green, trains are and will continue to be one of the most cleanest and energy efficient mode of transportation.\n\nEven if the trains are powered by diesel, due to the inherit efficiency of trains, the effect is negligible (though they should all be electric).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tld0d4bx8ksd1.jpg?width=3579&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d94a5e0ae45e49181a772e81eaf156ec597c24d\n\n[https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/environment-and-safety/sydney-trains-environment-and-sustainability/why-rail-travel-a](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/environment-and-safety/sydney-trains-environment-and-sustainability/why-rail-travel-a)\n\n[https://www.greenguides.net/post/trains-reduce-carbon-footprint](https://www.greenguides.net/post/trains-reduce-carbon-footprint)\n\nNext, lets go over Physical Space:\n\nEven with trains that have a larger loading gauge of over 3 meters, at most for a double track, including the equipment on the side, a double track is usually under 10 meters wide. That may seem big, but a single highway lane in North American is 3.66 meters (12 feet) wide, not the mention the shoulder, how vegetation near the highway has to be cut so that a car doesn't directly crash into a tree, and don't get my started on a 20 lane highway.\n\nAnd let's not forget, PARKING!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxs9a0k49ksd1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e040c43852c8565275ae827f662aa79555e790a0\n\nSo much space is wasted for parking cars, especially on surface parking lots. Thousands of Arces of land, land that belongs to plants, animals, and people are paved over for a parking lot! F\\*ck surface parking lots especially!\n\nWhereas with trains, a track siding is more than sufficient as the trains can just park in a line parallel to the mainline. And even the largest of train yards do not take up the sheer about of space used for parking cars.\n\nContinuing on with Ecological Impacts:\n\nWhile all human development *does* unfortunately negatively impact the environment, trains can mitigate our impact. Going over the points made before, trains produce little to no air emissions, take up less space, and generally do not impact the environment as badly as cars. And especially with grade separated underground and/or elevated railways, A. They don't cut the environment in half, and B. Once construction is done, nature can reclaim the area, I mean, just look at how trees and vegetation grows around a railway viaduct.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dt1rrp1q9ksd1.jpg?width=1414&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf35509aa48c88beeed47d259589432a80cc688\n\nHuman and Animal Collisions:\n\nIt's no secret that cars kill millions of animals each year and thousands of people! Like holy sh\\*t, F\\*ck Cars!\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nAnd while trains *do* unfortunately hit people and animals, it's nowhere near the same extent as cars for several reasons.\n\nA. Even on a frequent mainline with trains every ten minutes or so, it's nowhere near the constant traffic of a highway, meaning that animals and people can have a chance to cross safely.\n\nB. Trains are more predictable than cars and don't invade so many spaces unlike cars which can crash into you even if you're not crossing the road.\n\nC. Railway lines are more likely to be elevated, greatly reducing the risk of train-people/animal collisions compared to roads which are almost always on the surface.\n\nIf most high-speed and high frequency railway lines are elevated, not only are they grade separated making frequent service and automation easier, but they would have little impact on people and animals once construction is complete as people and animals can just walk underneath without worrying about getting run over, the same can't be said about cars.\n\nResources:\n\nTrains last a long time, like a *really* long time. Many old steam trains are still operational, and more older metro trains from the 1970s and 80s are still in operations. Compared to cars and your iPhone, trains don't need to be visually updated each year, which lets be real here is a massive waste of resources. Unlike personal commodities, trains are made on a per-order basis meaning they're not mass produce, reducing the chance of unsold units.\n\nOnce a timeless, future proof design is met (open gangway metro trains) even trains from a new batch with updated technology can quite literally look [exactly the same](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/canada-line-skytrain-new-trains-in-service) as the older first batch. Also, trains are more likely to be modular and can be upgraded and rebuilt, and generally use less resources than cars. Also, you don't need as many of them to maintain good service.\n\nAnd on the infrastructure side of things, old, wore out steel railway tracks can be recycled into new rails, and due to the better weight distribution of trains, concrete railway viaduct can basically last forever with proper maintenance whereas car destroy their own roads, and there's no need to \"repave\" the way for railways to the same extent as with cars.\n\nCountering suburban sprawl:\n\nCars encourage suburban sprawl, which is devastating towards the environment. One thing that's common in many nature documentaries are scenes of \"human encroachment into nature\" as they show an image of a forest being cut down for houses. The issue here is suburban sprawl, not people as a whole. (Also, it's the rich who produce more waste than anyone else. Blame them, and not humans as a whole).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vr7owdkaksd1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe968f938abff43f931754639ce328d0eea41e2d\n\nContrary to popular belief, having dense cities is actually *better* for the environment than suburban sprawl as no matter what, human development disturbs the natural world. But what we can do is minimize the impact by minimizing the space we use. Having dense cities allows for less space to be taken up by people, and *more* space to left for nature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pk41kgfsaksd1.jpg?width=2856&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dab5829e7863e35d2f527ceb3f5d5473d76f462\n\nAlong with elevated railways that have little impact on nature once completed, trains can reduce suburban sprawl and hence, allow more space for nature.\n\nTrains are a stepping stone in mitigating modern-day, militaristic imperialism (this section is really long and I do go into a rant. Sorry in advance):\n\nThis is a more political point, but think about, how much of modern day imperialism can be tied directly or indirectly to cars? A lot of it in my books. The meme that the United States invades a place with oil is very much true. What was the Iraq War for, oil (not because Saddam has WMDs that never existed or about fighting for \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" nah, it was for oil). What is the Russian invasion of Ukraine for, well it's technically for natural gas, but we might as well say it's for oil.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/niglnu1kbksd1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c048eb886b4e3e39f53fb3a2e1d5162d3dda727\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3ts0tygbksd1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e13b8fa780b16b825b05a4cf89f4920164baf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jvk7efhbksd1.jpg?width=3500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5c3ccc75b592e33dc87730faec9df304e6f46c\n\nAnd why does the U.S. support Israel despite its constant war crimes and that their \"soldiers\" are loudly and proudly posting their war crimes on social media, its for oil, as Isntreal is nothing more than a US military outpost in the Middle East to control its oil. As Joe Biden said back in the 1980s, \"If there wasn't an Israel, we would make an Israel!\"\n\nAlso, my mom's country (Cambodia) was destabilized by US intervention (Operation Menu) which allowed Pol Pot to take over due to the destabilization caused by the bombings. And the US would later support Pol Pot as a way to get back at the Vietnamese. So I have little tolerance for US military supporters and War Hawks in general. Those people can F\\*ck off. Also, the French colonized Indochina for its rubber for car tires. So, F\\*ck the French as well.\n\nRant Over:\n\nSorry for the rant, but to simplify, because the US is so car dependent, and that expensive gas would be devastating towards the US economy. Market forces compells the US to seize cheap oil by any means necessary, hence the lame excuse that \"We're here to spread 'Freedom' and 'Democracy'\" when it's really just for the oil, I mean the US supports the theocratic government of Saudi Arabia for crying out loud.\n\nAnd it's just not only gas cars, many battery-electric cars have the cobalt and lithium for their batteries being mined by literal slave labor! So, even if gas cars are phased out for electric ones, human and ecological exploitation is at the core of the auto industry.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, trains a*re* unfortunately used in imperalism and wars, namely for supplies and resource extraction. But I think I can safely say that while trains were used for imperialist ventures, said imperialist ventures are not *for* trains as trains can be made domestically with relatively little resources, whereas cars, especially electric cars require more rare earth minerals. It was not like the British were here to say \"A yes, we are here to 'civilize' these 'savages' in the name of trains!\" No, they brought trains over for resource extraction, but it wasn't *for* trains.\n\nOf course, the issue here is capitalism, but I won't go too deeply into that for this post. But I can argue that most modern wars for oil are either directly or indirectly cause by cars.\n\nNow, let's compared the crappy imperialist legacy of the auto industry to trains. For the most part, trains can be produce domestically with relatively few resources. Are more likely to be manufactured by a state-owned company which \"usually\" tends to have better labor relations. Are built by skilled personnel, and are make on a per-order basis and *not* mass produced, reducing waste. I forget to mention this part before but to put it simply, trains (the rolling stock themselves) are just not as profitable as cars. But that's not a bad thing as the utility of trains far exceeds that of cars.\n\nNow, in more transit oriented countries, there just isn't the imperialist need for oil to power cars since there's less cars and less reliance on oil. Take Japan for example, gas is expensive, but since the country is less dependent on cars, it can make due without offensive military actions. I know that in Modern day Japan, it has a self defense force which is prohibited from taking part in offensive actions (though that has to do with WW2. Don't get me wrong, Imperial Japan is hella Imperialist which committed countless atrocities, yet their military lacked the oil to continue the long term fight). Needless to say, when a country is less dependent on cars and oil, it's less likely to take part in overt imperialist actions.\n\nThere's still soft power imperialism which is a totally different issue, not to mention that oil is mostly used for energy production, but if countries were less oil and car dependent, it is one step in mitigating modern-day, war-based imperialism (the issue is capitalism, but we need first steps here).\n\nTo conclude this section, and Spicy take here, but I'm gonna say that if you drive a car, *you* support imperialism. I mean, one of the posters on this subreddit literally says \"Stop Putin, Ride a Bike.\"\n\nNow because my previous section was so long, I'll speed run through these points.\n\nNoise Pollution:\n\nCities aren't loud, cars are! And one jerk in a loud car is *way* worse than any train. Also, modern trains are quiet.\n\nLight Pollution:\n\n[Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1fnrw3l/cars_and_light_pollution/)\n\nIn conclusion, at least with my interpretation, much of the problems that we face today can be tied directly and/or indirectly to cars. Climate change? Cars! Ecological Destruction? Cars! Suburban Sprawl? Cars! Child Slave Labor for Lithium? Cars! Imperialist Wars? Cars! Light and Noise Pollution? Cars!\n\nI know my observations may not be fully accurate and that I might be blaming cars on issues that are far more complex, but you can't deny how many issues in the world are caused by cars.\n\nBut one of the solutions to resolving and/or mitigating these issues are trains. So to save the world, we Quite Literally Need... Trains!",

In addition to these certifications, the batteries are thoroughly tested by our in-house product development team, as well as a third-party testing facility.\n\nAlso, Lectric eBikes' chargers pass the ISO 4210 standards for safety.\u001d\n\nI\u0019m inclined to trust them but I\u0019m relatively new to the biking scene and I want to make sure it\u0019s safe despite (what it appears to be) a lack of UL certification. \n\nI don\u0019t charge the batteries overnight. I take them out of the bikes after use. \n\nAgain, I\u0019m sorry for inviting this discourse again. I know the majority of the fires have not been actual e-bikes but I wanted to make sure and get input from the community.",

      "text": "I respectfully feel like a lot of people in this subreddit need to understand that lithium mining is a cruel industry and we haven't figured out how to fully recycle lithium. I really think cars aren't THAT bad in comparison considering what I just said, and that you need to charge said lithium battery with charging stations that are linked to fossil fuel burning power plants for the most part.\n\nI've also went through a few batteries on my electric skateboard because after you charge them a a few hundred times, it doesn't work very good. This is the case with electric cars also but they are much larger batteries. There are a lot of people who have electric cars from like 7 years ago that have horrible battery mileage. And people will say \"well yeah but Ill just get a lease and switch the cars out every few years\". This mentality is somehow \"green\" but anyone who actually thinks about the issue knows that it is incredibly dangerous and those batteries being thrown away by you every few years is going to add up to the pollution that lithium batteries cause. Currently we can only recycle about 50% of the battery. This number is from March of this year. We need to stop pretending that this is okay.",

Here is Jeff himself driving one of these E rickshaws : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2onRQXgojo\n\nAs an Indian living in India, the 'need' for car doesnt really make sense. Within 1 km (0.6 mi) of my house, I have literally  hundreds of shops - grocery / barber / restaurants / cycle repair / doctor's clinic / cafe / milk booth / even imported swiss chocolates.\n\nSince the last 2 years, online delivery of groceries have really ramped up. These delivery boys (of amazon or local company) use escooters or erickshaws to deliver everything.\n\nUber / Ola is cheaper than owning a car (insurance / maintaince / fuel). I hire a rickshaw anyway through these apps.\n\nTrain network is well developed, more electrified than EU / US, and bullet train network is under construction. Local Metro trains are currently operational in 15 cities : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oToAoQvi4Ns\n\nErickshaws are a game changer. These are 2000 USD / 25kmph 3 wheelers which usually carry 4-6 passengers / cargo in dense neighbourhoods. There are more than 5 million of these All India : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqVIjKNdjC8\n\nThis has created well paying jobs for atleast 5 million families along with robust Indian manufacturing for these. Also reducing the need for millions of personal scooters (usually petrol).\n\nAn Indian startup Ola (now a 10B USD+ company) has created world's largest 2 wheeler Electric Scooter plant, taking bookings online : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKhkE0AuJ0\n\nMajor cities are getting electric buses : https://www.electrive.com/2022/03/08/olectra-delivers-150-electric-buses-to-pune/\n\nCars are a huge waste of metal / batteries / space / energy. For travelling within city, they are much more expensive than Uber / Ola apps or erickshaws. For travelling from one city to another, they are quite slow (compared to trains).\n\nAll electric vehicles need a minimum running everyday to break-even with a petrol vehicle. Delivery guys travel a lot, and EVs help reduce massive pollution and fuel bills.\n\n2022 is another lesson why we should move away from petrol / diesel. No more funding crazy dictators. But the shift should be towards Electric public infra, not electric cars.\n\nFeel free to ask anything stupid haha.",

It is ultimately the future, whether we go nuclear or make Solar energy more efficient and sustainable.\n\nBut say we disavow Fossil Fuels in our planes and instead go nuclear, or do something else. It will need to be safety tested, yes, but ultimately, Planes don\u0019t really need much infrastructure to fulfill their purposes. They cause very little problems outside of the CO2 they dump in the atmosphere, and I think that once we move away from Fossil Fuels, they\u0019ll be environmentally okay.\n\nIf we disavow Fossil Fuels in our cars, you\u0019ve only solved one problem with regard to cars. You still haven\u0019t solved the problem of cars being unsafe, especially since the driver is expected to maintain a consistent mental state every time they operate a vehicle, a problem that can\u0019t be engineered away. You haven\u0019t solved the issue of the massive prices, and you haven\u0019t helped the poor in any way. Rather, because Cars can now be marketed as \u001cenvironmentally friendly\u001d, you\u0019ve paved the path for more and larger roads, completely screwing over people with lower income that would appreciate using a train or bus. You haven\u0019t made the city more pedestrian friendly.\n\nYou haven\u0019t solved city infrastructure or got rid of that excess land use thanks to our horribly large parking lots. \n\nIn conclusion, I think planes can be made to work with better city infrastructure, and really, they fulfill a niche that no other mode of transport does, though better international railway is a much better alternative for shorter distances. Cars cannot be made to work merely by slapping a battery on and burning clean energy, because they have far too many problems outside of their CO2 and Methane.",

What I don't miss is how expensive it is compared to other things I enjoy. I look at it not in terms of exact price, but in orders of magnitude. Consider these quick and dirty examples, assuming you're buying things new:\n\n- $40 - Eating out.\n- $400 - a very nice personal item, such as a guitar, a stylish outfit, a game console. A couple of good power tools plus the batteries and chargers. A entry-level bicycle.\n- $4000 - a high quality major home appliance, such as a refrigerator, oven, or furnace. A top-tier PC for professional work and gaming. A great camera with lenses and accessories. A rowboat. A jaw-droppingly cool bicycle. A week-long vacation for two.\n- $40,000 - a car. A formal education. A down payment for a home. Renovating an attic into a modern loft. Taking a year off work for a sabbatical or to start a business. \n- $400,000 - where I live, a historic house in good condition that will hold its value over time.\n\nCars are kind of cool. I miss the cozy solitude of just cruising in my little personal box at night. I just feel like the car here is in the wrong category. The value I place on it is similar to the items one order of magnitude lower, like a PC or a large appliance. In contrast, taking a year off work, setting up your career or putting down on a house are things that touch on a higher plane of considerations about your long-term future and your place in the world. \n\nTo the average driver in my life, instead of guilting them, I just want to say, imagine what you could do with $40k. You could probably close on a house, complete some huge renovation project or change the direction of your life in some way. These are possibilities we shut ourselves off to with \"I can't afford it\" all while paying a fortune to own a depreciating asset.",

The city is planning on going fully battery-powered electric by 2035, with minimal expansion of trolley buses. When I asked the representative why, she said it was because the infrastructure of trolley buses is difficult to install and maintain, and people don\u0019t like the look of the wires above the cables. So I guess my question is while an electric bus is better than a fossil fuel run bus, and any bus is more sustainable than a car, there still arises the issue of mining for lithium being very unsustainable, and usually unethical. Is there anyway I could advocate for the city to expand more trolley bus lines, or does anyone know of more ethical and sustainable way to produce batteries for vehicles?",

      "text": "Imagine if privately owned cars are phased out, and everyone not needing a car for their work get there by walking, bike or public transport. Would this work towards fulfilling the sustainable development goals formulated by UN? Let's look at the most obvious ones:\n\n**3 Good health and well-being**\n\nRemoving cars from the road, even electric ones, will contribute to an improvement of air quality (less smog, but also dust), which improves living conditions, particularly for people with respiratory conditions. More walking and biking will also contribute to reducing obesity, and road accidents would be greatly reduced.\n\n**7 Affordable and clean energy**\n\nThe main point here is the reduction of energy requirements, such that countries that use a mix of fossil and renewable energy sources can outphase the former and use the latter to power public transit.\n\n**9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure**\n\nA transition to smart and efficient collective transit systems requires a lot of innovation and deployment of infrastructure. We won't solve it, I would rather say that removing cars would make this goal even more important.\n\n**10 Reduced inequalities**\n\nIn the category of financial inequalities, more focus on public transport, (ideally heavily subsidized) would even out the playing field for people with respect to how they get around.\n\n**11 Sustainable cities and communities**\n\nThis is what the sub is all about: Creating liveable cities with minimized negative effect on the surrounding environment. Need I say more?\n\n**12 Responsible consumption and production**\n\nMost countries in Europe have automobiles, their parts, or oil/gas as their main export articles. This is by no means responsible production. Tremendous amounts of resources (metal, plastics, rare minerals for batteries, etc.) would be spared. Also, with most/all vehicles owned by people who know what they are doing, the vehicles would be well maintained and have extensive program for recycling of parts.\n\n**13 Climate action**\n\nThis one is mainly about making those in control implement policies (like the banishing of cars), but indirectly, we could focus on other issues now that cars are out of the picture.\n\n**14 Life below water**\n\nTires in motion on asphalt is a huge contributer to microplastics ending up in the sea. Let's stop putting it there.\n\n**15 Life on land**\n\nParking lots and long stretches of highways could be dismantled and turned into meadows and forests where dwindling wildlife populations could thrive.\n\nGoals 1,2,4,5,6,8,16,17 are only affected in minor/indirect ways as I see it, but comments on these are welcome.\n\nI would argue that the global banishment of private cars would be one of the most effective single actions for fulfilling UN's goals. Maybe side by side with efficient lab growth of all kinds of food in conjunction with repurposing most farmland as forests. It remains to be seen which is most realistic.",

I know nothing about electric vehicles or battery capacity, but I guessed that a bus would require a similar battery size to a tractor trailer, and that they\u0019d need to be charged frequently like compact EVs do. Bus routes rely on consistency, so wouldn\u0019t it be problematic to take buses out of commission a couple of times a day so they could be charged at a charging station? Would they have to rely on overhead wires like the trucks in the Scott video? I\u0019m hoping someone more experienced in transit/EVs can answer this for me.",

      "text": "So, a thought occurred to me very recently. The average car horn creates a sound at a volume of around 108 decibels, around as loud as a chainsaw. Exposure to sounds of around 110 decibels for longer than 1.5 minutes a day puts a person at high risk of developing permanent hearing damage.\n\nIt's considered battery to spit on someone intentionally, because of the risk of potentially spreading disease to that person. So if *that* is considered a malicious act done with intent to harm, shouldn't blaring your car horn at someone who mildly inconvenienced you, or is taking advantage of their right of way *also* be considered a malicious act with intent to harm considering that car horns are loud enough to cause potential permanent hearing damage after just a few moments of continuous exposure, prosecutable as assault or battery?",

And please interpret everything I say as satire.\n\nStory:\n\nSo, I was thinking about Adam Something's satirical [post](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcvfHa-GHSOHFAjU0-Ie57A/community?lc=UgzQm63rsj8XdE_6OPB4AaABAg&amp;lb=UgkxBICqJHnCay_d_GXavSaJc-9WAi4nazgo) about seeing a rail inspection vehicle (a car with train wheels on a train track).\n\nThen I thought to myself \"We have a car on train tracks, what if we put a train on the road?\"\n\nAnd then I remembered that [LeTourneau's Land Trains](https://youtu.be/abGyX2uwXsw) existed. However, they were originally a niche cargo transportation vehicle that failed for various reasons. Then I thought \"what if you took LeTourneau's Land Train concept, but you design it for passenger services?\"\n\nTake LeTourneau's modular fuel electric drive system and scale it down to use in bus wheels. Now you have an electric bus that can run on either fuel or batteries. Now make a bunch of modular bus passenger wagons and link them all into a train. It's a Bus Train!\n\nI live in the United States where car-brain politicians seem to believe that it's a cardinal sin to spend money on anything other than maintaining and expanding roads and highways.\n\nImagine yourself as a US politician. Your cities need some kind of public transportation to help reduce traffic. Trains and trams would be a perfect solution, but it's a sin to build them. Now here comes in a salesman with this new \"Bus Train\". It's a train that goes on roads! Why spend money on train and tram infrastructure when you can buy a Bus Train as your \"public transportation\" and you can keep building roads because that's the only thing your car-brain religion knows how to build. Solve traffic by having people ride on an obscenely long bendy bus that snakes through your city.\n\nMy brain keeps pondering this idea.\n\nI know it's a dumb idea, but the US has funded MANY dumb public transport ideas in the past.\n\nWhat I want to know is, would US politicians be smart enough to realize that the \"Bus Train\" is a dumb idea and shouldn't be pursued, OR would US politicians think it's a brilliant idea and throw millions of dollars at me to develop this idea?\n\nWhat if someone did fund this dumb idea? How cursed would it be to see an obscenely long bendy bus snaking its way through a city?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k85m1soap4ka1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f9d3dfa83dc8db67022c6026afa2c2f252acd7d",

      "text": "Highways: the chance of a crash may be low, but IF something happens at 100+ km/h, its very deadly. So how is this not a reason to significantly reduce the speed limit on highways?\n\nIn cities and busy areas or places with limited visibility on whats coming right and left, I often find that the speed limits are way too high. With a few rare exceptions, the lowest speed limit in my country is usually 30 km/h, even in places where 30 is very unsafe.\n\nAt many places I come to the conclusion that the speed limit is too high and not safe.\n\nI suggest the following change:\n\n* The ultimate speed limit that applies everywhere: 50 km/h, now bikes and pedestrians and whoever wants to, can also safely and legally use the highway. More freedom!!!\n* In places where its less safe to travel at high speed: let the speed limit be one that truly is very safe.\n* Enforce the speed limits much more. Slightly exceed the limit? Get a fine. Exceed the limit significantly, or a second time? Be banned from driving for atleast a year.\n* An deadly accident happened somewhere that wouldn't have been deadly if the speed limit was lower? Reduce the speed limit on that road immediately.\n\nSince I was very specific by coming up with the number 50: maybe this is too fast or too slow, but you can get the idea.\n\nPros:\n\n1. many lives are saved\n2. more freedom so anyone can use the highway instead of only cars.\n3. better fuel efficiency. Electric cars won't require huge batteries which is bad for the environment, and will get relatively better range.\n\nCons:\n\n1. drivers have a longer commute.\n2. if a driver truly has an important emergency, and im not talking about the police/fire/medical kind of emergency, it could be an issue. But this can't possibly outweigh the benfit of slower speed limits\n\nSo, I don't get why the speed limits don't get significantly decreased? It has more advantage than disadvantage, right?",

      "title": "Carless living in a mid-size American city (my results)",
      "text": "For the last 2 months I have been performing a social experiment on myself. I moved into the city for uni, and decided to not bring my car with me. Let me preface this and say that my apartment is 0.7 miles from the city center. Here was my rationale:\n\n1. Don't want to pay $120/month to park in my apartment's garage as well as a $100/semester pass at one of my campuses. Also gas is still very expensive.\n2. Don't want drive around for 10 minutes looking for a spot every time I get to campus.\n3. Don't want to worry about my catalytic converter getting stolen (again).\n4. Don't want to worry about a DUI.\n5. Actually a shorter trip to one of the campuses I go to by bike than by car. (Because parking).\n6. All-you-can-ride bus pass is only $30/month for uni students, veterans, and people with disabilities.\n7. Wanted to see how PRACTICAL carless living was in an average American city.\n\nSo here I am, in Indianapolis , Indiana. A mid-size US city with a metro pop of 2.2 mil. Pretty average transit for this country. Here's what I have available to me:\n\n1. North-south battery-electric BRT line with covered, elevated island stations. Also has preferred signaling and dedicated lanes for the entire length of the line. 15 minute frequency. I don't use this much cause it's just one line and happens to not be near my campuses.\n2. \"bike lanes\" (lol) are common but honestly doesn't matter unless they are protected. Some are but most aren't. There are dedicated bikeways on one of my campuses which is really nice, and the downtown has some streets converted to carless walkways/bikeways. \n3. Normal grid bus network with frequencies ranging 30-60 mintues. This is honestly unacceptable and my biggest complaint so far. The 60min routes are USELESS if you have a tight schedule.\n\nSo with all that here's how I get around, and what it costs me in terms of time and money:\n\n1. I walk or bike to one of my campuses cause my apartment is only a 12 minute walk or 4 minute bike ride.\n2. For my other campus, it's a 30 minute bike ride, mostly on sidewalks, protected walkways/bikeways, and a couple of sketchy \"bike lanes\".\n3. For the same campus, a bus ride is 25-35 minutes, but it has 60min frequency. I usually end up missing it and having to ride my bike.\n4. Renting those electric scooters, about $5 for an average ride. Although I did wipe out on one the other night, and fucked up my arm, wrist, and stomach pretty bad. Probably not getting back on one of those for a while...\n5. Riding around the neighborhood on my bike to get food or go do shit is pretty easy. Lots of protected bike lanes near city center. If I'm staying downtown its leaps and bounds faster than a car.\n6. 2 minute walk to the grocery store. I have a little foldable cart if I need to get a lot of stuff.\n7. If I'm going a bit farther like to the barber shop, bike-bus combo works pretty well, but the farther the trip, the more the difference between a car and bike trips grows. \n8. If I'm going to my parents house (45 minutes north by car), I take the BRT to the top of the line then I hop on an old railroad converted to a trail. The trail is actually really cool and runs north-south almost all the way through Indiana. The bike ride is about 1.5 hours. Not bad for me because I'm pretty fit, but I get this isn't super practical.\n9. Sometimes I get screwed and have to uber about once or twice a week. My average ride costs about $15.\n\nOverall, I spend $30/month for bus pass, $5/month for new bike tubes, and \\~$100/month on uber. $35/month if I can cut out uber, which just requires better planning. Between parking, gas, and maintenance, my car would probably cost me \\~$400/month. I am definitely saving a lot of money, but everyday is a real-time challenge to be navigated on how to get around, even at the city center.",

      "text": "Context:\n\nRomania, in the EU, is seemingly competing with the UK over high energy prices. There's a consumer subsidy in place for energy based on a certain limit. For electricity, it's 255 kWh per month. If you stay under that energy use amount, your electricity bill gets subsidized to a much lower price.  If you pass that ceiling, you pay the full price, which is pretty high. Electric car owners have a problem:  the fuel is expensive. If they charge at home, they risk using more than 255  and paying the real price.  Their solution: look for free or cheap charging stations and charge there. Many of these stations have closed, since the costs are so large that it's bad business.  The few that are left attract large queues and, with that, competition and people trying to jump queue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAuto translation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It's 1:30 a.m., past midnight. Sunday  to Monday night, instead of resting for a new week of work, a group of  people wait, scruffy, in the parking lot of Kaufland P\u0003curari. With  their eyes on the illuminated phones, they take another look at a tall  device, with a colored screen, with three thick cables connected to one  machine each. These are the residents of Ia\u0019i who had the courage to enter \"a new automotive era\": that of electric cars.** \n\nThey  ended up not being able to charge their cars at home anymore, due to  the imposed energy ceiling of 255 kilowatts per month. Disappointed  at present, they were attracted a few years ago by the reduced price of  energy, and now, they are looking to charge their cars with electricity  for free, until this facility also disappears. In  fact, Kaufland is the last \"combatant on the ramparts\" of the fight  against climate pollution: the store in P\u0003curari is the last one that  still offers free electricity to the owners of green cars in Iasi, but  the offer will, in all probability, be discontinued in the near future. This  is why, day and night, residents who have purchased electric cars  charge their cars here for free, even if the store's hours are only  until 10 p.m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dacia car charging in queue](https://preview.redd.it/xi2trddc7eq91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ca86d238dfe43e71042d3b6eee49d95e1d35fd2)\n\n\"I stay at home, I bought a BMW hybrid. It's hard to charge with current, I already have two hours of battery life, for six kilowatts. I am 64 years old, and I live in Valea Lupului. I'd rather stay at Kaufland to charge my car battery for free than at home. Every day, charging at the car ends up exceeding the limit of 255 kilowatts, if I charge it at home. That's it,\" a man tells us, circling by his black car. It is connected to a cable that provides little energy, similar to at home. The other two, which quickly charge the battery, are occupied by a Tesla and a Renault Zoe. At 4 o'clock in the morning, there were still people from Ia\u0019i loading their cars. On the application, there were three that had the cables connected, and three more were waiting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kaufland parking charging station](https://preview.redd.it/gt62mcdy8eq91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5215087828fcccc434c986e868b75ceb29782ee1)\n\n## At Lidl, the drivers got into a fight in front of the loaders\n\nKaufland stores were among the big companies that promoted electric, green cars. So did the state, but the latter has meanwhile abandoned the strategy of offering free electricity. However, Kaufland had come quite far: it had created a network of fast car chargers on the route Bucharest - Iasi - Chisinau. You only had to make monthly purchases of at least 500 lei with them. But,  with the war in Ukraine and the explosion of the price of electricity,  those from Kufland gradually abandoned this policy, which they still  maintain only in a few locations. Another store chain that wanted to attract customers with electric cars is Lidl. The company opened its large store in Moara de Foc, and a space with electric car chargers was created for customers. After the crisis of the increase in fuel and the increase in the price of electricity,\n\n\"I went several times to separate them. They simply didn't want to follow the line on the application. They fought like crazy. So they closed\", an employee here told us. This  is how it happens that in the place of electric charging there is a  large notice, to be noticed from the street, which warns that the device  is defective. Another  place where you could charge for free for a while, until current prices  increased, was at the Tudor Office Center building on Ciurchi, between  Metalurgie and T\u0003t\u0003ra_i. And here it was closed, no longer profitable. \"It's defective, charging doesn't work anymore. The owners said they would fix it, but they never did,\" said a security guard here.\n\n## What are the charging prices currently\n\nCurrently,  the main problem of those who have purchased electric or hybrid cars is  to find a place to charge their cars at the most convenient price. The specific applications do not contain all the places to load, so it is good to talk to older owners. One of them gave us a tip. \"It  is a company in the industrial area that has a place to charge and  sells Fast current, i.e. supercharge, at a price of 1.2 lei per  kilowatt. But don't tell many\", he drew our attention. In  comparison, at the E.ON Drive stations in the city as well as in the  county or region, the company sells one kilowatt of electricity at Fast,  i.e. quickly charged - approximately one hour and ten minutes, at the  price of 2.29 lei. If you have a car that \"swallows\" 40 kilowatts, you have to pay 90 lei out of your pocket for a quick charge.\n\nThe price for a charge at E.ON Drive is 1.79 kilowatts, which means that you will pay 71 lei. However, the most advantageous seem to be those who live at home and have solar panels. The price for an equipment with solar panels that gives 9.9 kilowatts on a sunny day is 10,000 euros, including VAT. The  warranty for these solar panels is 25 years, during which time the  investment is amortized, and the owner benefits from cheap current  including for an electric car. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAuto translate: [https://www-ziaruldeiasi-ro.translate.goog/stiri/bataie-pe-curent-gratis-pentru-incarcarea-masinilor-electrice-cozi-la-miezul-noptii-in-cateva-puncte-strategice--334267.html?\\_x\\_tr\\_sl=auto&amp;\\_x\\_tr\\_tl=en&amp;\\_x\\_tr\\_hl=en&amp;\\_x\\_tr\\_pto=wapp](https://www-ziaruldeiasi-ro.translate.goog/stiri/bataie-pe-curent-gratis-pentru-incarcarea-masinilor-electrice-cozi-la-miezul-noptii-in-cateva-puncte-strategice--334267.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp)",

I am grateful that my EUC is welcome in my place of work vs leaving it outside in our sketchy parking lot, even more that so far no one has complained about me topping the batteries off with company power. I did previously receive a complaint for recharging ebike batteries at a previous job, but nothing came of it. I think businesses would do well to accommodate the recharging of PEV batteries and small e-vehicles as far as designated areas for the purpose, which could be as simple as designating the space, outlets, power strips, gear storage/shelving.  They could even advertise this as a hiring perk/benefit. Are there any other EUC riders here? Does your employer encourage, discourage, or neither encourage nor discourage PEV use?",

      "text": "It seems to me that mass transit for people should also as a concept apply to transport of goods.\n\nWe don't have an organised system of goods delivery. Look at any street for a while and you will probably see one of the many private companies, be it Amazon, or a local supermarket, or the separate parcel delivery companies in their vans. The duplication and added trip length must be very considerable.\n\nWorking vehicles like these, whilst they have good justification to be quite large, as compared to SUV's and most cars carrying one occupant, are still another kind of vehicle that could be made more efficient and therefore reduced in number and trips.\n\nBack in the day, in my country, we were at times strangely ahead of the curve, and didn't seem to realise it, or capitalise on it fully -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m4VWrfPNxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m4VWrfPNxM)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk\\_float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_float)\n\nOne problem that was encountered by these vehicle manufacturers was that they lasted so long that some eventually went out of business. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/they-don-t-make-milk-floats-the-way-they-used-to-1587039.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/they-don-t-make-milk-floats-the-way-they-used-to-1587039.html)\n\nWhat may have been the largest fleet of electric vehicles in the world was served in a hub and spoke pattern from regional distribution yards owned by local dairies, now of course all sold off.\n\n&gt;In August 1967, the UK Electric Vehicle Association put out a [press release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release) stating that Britain had more battery-electric vehicles on its roads than the rest of the world combined.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_float#cite_note-Autocar1967-3) It is not clear what research the association had undertaken into the quantity of electric vehicles of other countries, but closer inspection disclosed that almost all of the battery-driven vehicles licensed for UK road use were milk floats.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_float#cite_note-Autocar1967-3)\n\nA resurrection of a system like that could combine a lot of different deliveries in one go to each street, served more than once a day.\n\nPerhaps companies can bid to serve areas and purchase local distribution centres, rather than duplicating their delivery routes and warehouses? Delivery rights could finance other public services. They could also collect from separate supermarkets in one go, or share a distribution centre there, or supermarkets would be required to cooperate somehow (I'm not sure how that could work though).\n\nSomething along these lines but narrower too and possibly articulated maybe able to share bike lanes as they tend to be pretty slow, similar to cargo bikes, but for longer range and larger payloads.\n\nAll this though would require a big change in mindset, similar to that required to modal switch to public transport, but on the side this time its the corporate world that is the focus. And would probably have to be forced to happen with a financial advantage being seen by the businesses that cooperate to use it and legislation to push cooperation through local carriers.\n\nFreight pipelines\n\nThis is somewhat different but similar in concept to an urban metro, this is more like the intercity train of the system and could distribute to the local distribution yards mentioned above. Yes freight rail does this but tends to only serve very large regional hubs.\n\n[https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/underground-pipelines-concept-to-cut-freight-traffic](https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/underground-pipelines-concept-to-cut-freight-traffic)\n\n[http://www.cargocap.com/content/what-is-cargocap](http://www.cargocap.com/content/what-is-cargocap)\n\nOf course, you could also move a lot more freight by rail than we do, and that is something that should be done either way.",

Long range high speed electric scooters have shown that even motorcycles are extremely overweight compared to what you need to transport a person long distances, and standardized battery-swapping stations would solve range issues forever. A 1-2 ton 5-seater is extremely overkill, and I think that now, with most families having one vehicle per adult, it makes sense for most to be buying slimmer, smaller, cheaper, lighter, more aerodynamic 2-seaters, with large families remaining as users of large family cars. I'm also personally more interested in tandem seating than side-by-side, as I dislike the standard of steering while sitting offset from center.\n\nEither way, in essence I'm asking this: How extreme is this sub?\n\nHow intent are you on forcibly stuffing me in a tight box with all of you?\n\nBecause in my eyes, the only good train is no more than half full, or I'd rather drive my last mile transportation all the miles.",

      "title": "How I would try to convince my past, car-brained self.",
      "text": "In this obviously hypothetical scenario, I will be going back in time to when I just started college. There I will talk to my past, car-brained self about cities where walking, cycling and public transportation can be viable alternatives to putting everyone into electric cars.\n\nFor some context, I have always been someone who focused on climate change, that it's indeed happening and that the burning of fossil fuels is what's causing it. Another aspect to decarbonization that I've always had appreciation for is how it results in the elimination of other pollutants, particularly NOx, SOx, ash, PM, HC emissions and smog. I've always seen that as a side benefit that just hasn't been talked about enough. However, I grew up in car-dependency to the point I literally couldn't imagine anything else.\n\nThe first thing I would say is that electric cars are good. If there are going to be cars on the road at all, they better be electric. I would hold off on criticising electric cars for the time being as my past self used to see any critique of electric vehicles as a parroting of fossil fuel industry propaganda. Call it a red line set by my past self. To avoid crossing red lines, I would instead pitch the concept of Car-low cities as not just compatible but complementary to electric cars for addressing climate change, air pollution and oil-dependence in general. The reason this is helpful is because of reduced car demand. The fewer cars we demand, the less batteries we'll need to stop using ICE cars and the more batteries will become available for dedicating to storing renewable energy when it's really windy or sunny. Overall, this results in faster decarbonisation than if demand for cars stay high. \n\nThere, I consciously implied battery production to continue unabated regardless and how I avoided criticising batteries. Again, it's important that I avoid my past self's red lines. Even now, I'm convinced that most criticisms against batteries are made in bad faith as they only tend to be used for shutting down discussions of alternatives to ICE vehicles. On that note, I must also be careful to avoid giving the false impression that urban planning centered around walking, cycling and public transportation is this perfect solution that won't actually get any traction. I used to be very sceptical of cycling infrastructure and public transportation because I never saw them done right before. This is why it was important to emphasise human-centric urban planning as a complement or supplemental to electric cars rather than a competitive either-or type of dilemma. It means that even if my past self has low confidence in human-centric urban planning picking up steam, at least electric cars would still be around as an alternative to fall back on.\n\nThe message I would give to my younger, car-brained self would be to see human-centric urban planning as an add-on, rather than as a competitor, to electric cars for the goal of weaning off of oil.\n\nWhat's also important is that I remember how I ended up getting enthusiastic human-centric urban planning: because of the overwhelming benefits to health, safety, quality of life and the wallet. Even my past self would have greatly appreciated the health benefits of walking and cycling, reduced traffic fatalities, reduced traffic congestion and not being forced into paying out the nose on car payments and insurance.\n\nIn conclusion, the way I would try to convince my past, car-brained self to embrace human-centric urban planning is to: \n\n1a) avoid stepping on the red lines by steering clear of attacking electric cars and batteries,\n\n1b) by pitching human-centric urban planning as supplemental to electric cars,\n\n2) by making the case for human-centric urban planning as good for health, safety, quality of life and the budget.\n\nHopefully this gives some insight into how one might convince others of adopting human-centric urban planning, if not getting them enthusiastic about it.\n\nSo how did you get convinced about human-centric urban planning and how might you have tried to convince your past self about it earlier?",

There\u0019s a lot of snow and all around, it\u0019s extremely cold. I won\u0019t lie and say it\u0019s great taking my city\u0019s very sub par transit in this weather, but driving doesn\u0019t seem to function all too well either.\n\nMy coworkers have to go outside and start and run their cars periodically so the batteries don\u0019t freeze. Cars have to be plugged in over night and even then they still might not turn on. Before going anywhere, cars frequently need to be (or people choose to&) ran for five to ten minutes prior to leaving. Cars get stranded because they just die and need a boost. It is an absolute shit show, honestly.\n\nThis is less related to the cold, but the upkeep of car infrastructure is also terrible. The constant salting of the roads affects the soil and plant growth in later seasons. Accidents happen left and right. The winter roads would be a lot safer with less vehicles on the street and I genuinely believe we\u0019d be happier as a society if we just had more subways and LRT to get around on when it got this cold. The trains in my city never fail me when extreme weather hits.\n\nAny other input?

      "text": "I see a lot of posts of street reworking to take a car lane and use it for bike lanes.\n\nAnother possibility is to take some lanes on motorways and convert then to a freight railway down the central area.\n\nWhat I envisage is that the freight railway would have vertical loading and unloading of shipping containers, maybe lorry trailers, and pallets so they can be moved up and over the motorway to a loading area to the side of the motorway, ideally near junctions so that trucks can be loaded. This could migrate much freight from HGV's / trucks onto railways until they reach the last part of the journey and switch to local collection for the final leg on the road to the destination. If you was really smart you could put a railway sidings at these locations so that you can move rail-to-rail as well for expanding the freight rail system.\n\nPhoto not mine, I got from another post [https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/xt72hl/hmmm\\_i\\_wonder\\_why\\_transit\\_ridership\\_is\\_so\\_low/iqp4q9w/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/xt72hl/hmmm_i_wonder_why_transit_ridership_is_so_low/iqp4q9w/?context=3) This is a passenger rail system but the author pointed out that access to the station is difficult and unpleasant due to the heavy road. A problem that might suit freight better with vertical lifts for cargo that can move horizontally to freight handling depots.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr3h6fznyar91.jpg?width=2822&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d471fe6da9181c7fc06bb25e10b9f378312130e\n\nSome ideas for improving these systems - which may or may not be practical;\n\nOne problem of converting highways to railways is that freight rail tends to need flatter paths than motorways due to its lower traction. A modified goods railway might use a laterally stiff linear induction motor rail to help provide greater traction when needed, and the use of a laterally stiff rail that guides the train laterally could reduce lateral motions (see hunting oscillation for more extreme examples) which results in wheel flange wear, track wear and noise. It also leads to the track deforming over time and this reduces vehicle efficiency and worsens the above problems. A central rail of this type could also be designed to allow clasping by brakes so that stopping distances on freight locos would be less, increasing overall capacity.\n\nThe linear induction motor  could be incorporated in this rail for extra traction when at sharp inclines. At junctions, they would end so that the train can switch tracks as need be.\n\nAs trains rarely leave their tracks you could put solar canopies over the central area, so that collisions would not be likely to bring down the canopy. An overhead pantograph could use a rigid catenary slung (and possibly part of the superstructure of the canopy) under the solar canopy, but all trains would have some battery range for operating in the yards for loading and unloading. The system would still have powered wheels, the linear induction motor is just used to help a conventional train deal with the inclines that may be found on motorways, or could allow even higher inclines than them. This may make the construction cost of new railways lower as well, since less tunnelling, bridges and cuttings would be required. Trains can more go over hills rather than through them.\n\nAn example of a linear motor rail system - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovia\\_Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovia_Metro)",

Can be used instead of a generator to power traffic lights and stuff when power goes out!!!  \nSo, instead of carrying a generator or battery pack only when power goes out, you're going to carry a generator all the time.

Here in the US and Europe as well lots of cities are transitioning their bus fleet to be EVs. I support the electrification of these vehicles but only if they are actually zero emission. Currently in climates that regularly get to below 70f/21c the use of an auxiliary heater is required to keep the batteries and interior of EV buses warm in order to not degrade battery charge state. The only solution for this issue is to eliminate the use of an auxiliary heater (diesel, gas, cng or otherwise) and replace it with trolley-like overhead power lines. By using constant grid power the batteries necessary can be reduced on each bus. Which will vastly save money, weight, and reduce the harmful process of mining rare earth minerals/metals needed for battery production. \n\nSource of my personal knowledge- I am a mechanic who works on these buses full time and a union worker. \n\nStudy links- https://www.uef.fi/en/article/surprisingly-high-emissions-from-fuel-powered-auxiliary-heaters-in-cars\n\nhttps://www.uef.fi/en/article/passenger-car-preheating-with-fuel-operated-auxiliary-heater-produces-as-much-particulate-emissions",

      "title": "Narrow Gauge railways - worth a second look?",
      "text": "Sorry about the length of this, its a bunch of ideas for the reintroduction of one of the oldest types of railway., the narrow gauge railway\n\n*My interest in this is that of very light rail and trolley systems that could be constructed at lower cost, snake around urban layouts and build out a lighter gauge and cheaper rail system for suburbia and somewhat similar to the old American interurban network.*\n\nNowadays narrow gauge railways are still used around the world, particularly in tram systems but with normal metro width vehicles running on them. Many of these gauges are almost standard width, but more narrow gauges such as 2 foot running with the narrower width train are to be found but mostly in tourist applications. I have ridden a few of these and although the carriages are narrower, the experience was very pleasant.  An example of a carriage [https://www.festrail.co.uk/pullman-first-class-carriages/#](https://www.festrail.co.uk/pullman-first-class-carriages/#)[!](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.festrail.co.uk%2Fpullman-first-class-carriages%2F%23!&amp;psig=AOvVaw0KnSokAr2a9uHwhHP-P-Mn&amp;ust=1667388489208000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAwQjRxqFwoTCJjTm6jwjPsCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84k3EGs0sGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84k3EGs0sGk)\n\nThey are about 3 to 3.5 feet narrower than a standard train on commuter services, at about 6 foot.\n\nThe advantages of this sort of train is tight turning circles and thereby the route can snake around obstacles and is cheaper, and tunnels can be smaller. The history of narrow gauge railways included mining rails made of wood centuries previously.\n\nThe disadvantage is that the narrow gauge railway tended not to be safe, with the top heavy steam engines derailments were a common occurrance. Another disadvantage related to that is slower top speed and narrow width means the railways tend to warp more over time. The wikipedia page on the topic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-gauge\\_railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-gauge_railway). I think however these issues are largely not an issue for very light rail with a lower overall mass and a low centre of mass (i.e. battery powered with batteries slung under seats.)  Centre of gravity makes a big difference.\n\nOne narrow gauge line built to serve people recently, also using narrower vehicles is the Line 15 in Sao Paulo - [https://trainspo.com/model/3776/](https://trainspo.com/model/3776/). The carriage width is 7 and a half foot and the track gauge is 2 foot 3 inch.\n\nThis is a really narrow gauge railway -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglB\\_hP4C0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglB_hP4C0w)\n\nThis is the old mail line running under London converted to carry tourists.\n\nIt uses 2 foot gauge and 9-foot (2.7 m) tunnel carrying two tracks. So these carriages are really narrow.\n\nAt this point the train starts to resemble a flat roller coaster.\n\nIf we look at the Tesla tunnels these are 12ft inner diameter and 13.5 foot outer diameter and they only carry in one direction, a single lane. This is slightly wider than the standard London Underground tunnels (11 foot 8 inches).\n\nAs we know, diameter has a big impact on the volume of material and costs of boring the tunnel.\n\n**A = À (d/2)\\^2**\n\nSo the London Mail Rail tunnel has 61.6293354 square feet of area, and if we assume that the width is inner diameter, and the total width is 10 foot, then it is 78.54 square feet, and the Tesla is 143.138815 square feet, nearly twice as much boring to do.\n\nAnd that is actually half the value, as the tunnels are one track vs the two in the mail rail system, and according to other data the boring machine used has a 14 foot diameter, not 13.5 foot given elsewhere for the outer diameter.\n\nNevertheless, you can see how narrow trains could make more efficient use of the space. A tunnel slightly wider, at 11 foot could accommodate roomier carriages and a wider track gauge so allowing greater speed.\n\nNarrow gauge, light duty track isn't just cheaper to construct because the route is more flexible and smaller, its easier to install and maintain. Welsh narrow gauge railway track can be physically handled by smaller crews and without all the specialist gear. I think this is an important point.\n\nThe narrower width is intended so as to accommodate new narrow tracks for bikes, e-bikes and the like and use route options that might not fit full width rail as well as can use mixed traffic roads in places.\n\nNow onto the vehicles - this is an innovative new very light rail system being developed in the UK - I can see also narrow versions of this are what would be used on a hypothetical new narrow gauge network -\n\nCoventry Very Light Rail\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=347247664042670](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=347247664042670)\n\nIn the video above you can see the very narrow turning radius, which I assume is down to the use of a box frame bogie with independent wheels as well as positioning.\n\n[https://www.urban-transport-magazine.com/en/vlr-very-light-rail-a-new-concept-for-coventry/](https://www.urban-transport-magazine.com/en/vlr-very-light-rail-a-new-concept-for-coventry/)\n\nIt uses weight saving technologies such as polycarbonate windows and composites. This could be taken further, and it has a battery system that recharges at special stops, the battery mass will fall over 50% in the future if Li-S batteries are commercialised, and motors (over 5kW/kg) being developed in other applications can slash the weight of the bogies. But already the engineers have got the rail vehicle down to 11 tons empty.\n\n\"As a result, VLR vehicles weigh no more than a tonne per linear metre. Hence, whilst a heavy rail vehicle typically weighs 44 tonnes and can carry 100 passengers, a similarly loaded 11-tonne Coventry VLR vehicle carries 50 passengers. This lower weight reduces infrastructure costs which is a key area for driving down railway costs.\"\n\nIn the long run such a vehicle should weigh no more than an equivalent capacity bus, maybe 7 tons. I see no reason why it should not get there. This gives several more tons of payload as well.\n\n[https://www.railengineer.co.uk/the-coventry-vlr-vehicle-affordable-light-rail-part-two/](https://www.railengineer.co.uk/the-coventry-vlr-vehicle-affordable-light-rail-part-two/)\n\nIn a new network it would be all low floor, since we presume there are no other rail lines for it to operate on with different height platforms. So for situations where we have a nice clean sheet. This is also advantageous as mixing traffic on conventional rail also means reinforcing your trains in the event of collision with heavier and faster trains.\n\nTop speed in certain segregated track might be 50 mph to connect to neighbouring towns, but in urban areas more like 20 to 30 mph, and there it runs line of sight, although can be integrated with traffic-light priority. Focus is on frequency rather than top speed.\n\nVehicles to be battery powered with recharging sections that can incorporate solar canopies with possible added shading to cycle lanes, for example, and walkways.\n\nWhat we want is the lightest train to operate on light duty track with little of the issues of the weight needing reinforcement of the road deck and it causing damage to subsurface utilities which may need to be moved. Get the weight down low enough and you can build with cheaper narrow gauge and smaller rails.\n\nNo continuous electrification, this is costly. [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\\_data/file/3872/low-cost-electrification-report.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3872/low-cost-electrification-report.pdf)\n\nElectrification is about £0.5 to £0.6 million per km per track, back in 2010. For the return track as well its over £1 million / km. Maybe a bit cheaper with very light duty trains\n\nWhat I would envisage is rail vehicles like the Coventry Very Light Rail but strung together so that there are two or three 50 seat carriages and one or two cargo wagons (independently powered with all wheel motors), with about 5 to 7 tonnes of cargo capacity in the form of standard Euro (or similar) pallets that can be rolled off at stations. Each carriage would weigh no more than say 11 to 12 tons fully loaded. These would be narrow gauge, so capacity would be lower but so too the mass. Each passenger carriage might carry 35 people, so three of these is about the same as a double decker bus.  We're going for frequency rather than maximum capacity on each train in this scheme.\n\nBy mixing pallet freight on the concept the pallets could be handled locally and last km delivery solution on cargo bikes could be used on adjacent cycle tracks to deliver to shops and residents. In suburban settings there is quite a bit more space to build out such a station. Cages could be used for other mail and delivery options.\n\nService frequency is very important, ideally 6 or more per hour.\n\nTrains also do not need to be that tall nowadays, low floor and placing of power train equipment under seats and in the bogies seems pretty doable on a low power vehicle. Not having continuous catenary also makes it easier to reduce height. This should improve top speed and smoothness of ride, as well as make tunnels smaller in diameter to take advantage of narrower width.\n\nAdditional ideas that I have are that of reducing stopping distance to improve safety and increase capacity. A simple way to do that is have small brake wheels with the plastic nylon or polyurethane wheels used on roller coasters, these have 10x the rolling resistance of steel wheels. If braking is required these could have a conventional steel flange attached and be lowered so that the mass of the train is shifted onto the braking wheel. Alternatively if the track has paving or tarmac on it between or outside the rails a more conventional wheel could be used in this fashion when required, and this also may permit higher inclines that can further reduce cost of constructing embankments, cuttings and viaducts.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to also to avoid as much as possible costly signalling, running ' line of sight' and using automated pacing and collision avoidance.\n\nResearch has shown that trams have higher ridership rates than buses and we should get much lower energy and running costs. Track is an installation cost \\*but\\* the ability to cushion and spread the force from the vehicle into a steel rail reduces ground pressure under it, and helps reduce the road damage that high axel loading vehicles like trucks cause, which cause most of the road damage. So ultimately there should be a good economic case.\n\n*Suggested dimensions / specifications for a new, MKII 'Interurban' system;*\n\nTrack gauge between 3ft to 3 ft 6 inches (example of 3 ft 6 inch gage here [https://i.redd.it/7m3zcnz7g9x91.jpg](https://i.redd.it/7m3zcnz7g9x91.jpg))\n\nTrain width - the width of the Sao Paulo 'line 15', is 7 and a half ft wide, so around this width ( a motorway road lane in UK is 12 feet) \\[\\[\\[[https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:\\~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners)\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:\\~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners))\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:\\~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners)\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/\\](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:\\~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners)))](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners)](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners))](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners)](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/](https://mocktheorytest.com/resources/how-wide-are-roads/#:~:text=The%20usual%20width%20of%20a,(e.g.%20in%20tight%20corners))))\n\nThis may also enable a road lane to effectively taken up with a tram and an adjacent narrow lane for light microvehicles and bikes and is designed to smoothly snake through almost any environment.\n\nTurning radius - 15 meters / 50 feet for full loop\n\nOverhead electrification - only on separated parts of the route, integrated with solar, and at dedicated recharging points. Uses a lower height charging system activated over the vehicle.\n\nSolar canopies can be used to cover adjacent bike and pedestrian areas against bad weather\n\nPowertrain -  All vehicles have their own battery storage or fuel cells + battery, all independent wheel motors, full on-board regenerative braking, box frames with independent wheels incorporating next-gen light motors at 5+kW/kg. Allow wheels with resilient suspension and steel rim.\n\nTrain length - 1 to 5 carriages. Each autonomous at low speeds for shunting and this assists switching out passenger carriages for freight carrying ones on the train when used off-peak. Connect via a magnetic coupling is possible.\n\nCarriage mass - around 5 to 7 tons is the goal empty, with future light batteries, motors, composite bodies etc. Cargo 7+ tons, palletised system. Passenger capacity 35 to 45 per carriage, variable with some automatically folding seats, that create more standing area at peak times.\n\nTop speed - 50mph?\n\nSignalling - mostly avoided and autonomous, depending on speed and junction. To use traffic light prioritisation that would be shared for buses.\n\nService frequency - 6 plus / hour but up to maybe 24. If a train can carry 40 passengers / carriage and have 5 of these on main routes, that's 200 per train peak capacity. At 12 trains per hour on these routes that is 2400 capacity, at 24 it is 4800. A road lane normally does about 1300 to 1800 from what I gather at a steady speed, but this is urban / suburban and the realistic capacity in rush hour, when it matters, I suspect is a lot lower.  Taking into account average occupancy its probably around 1300 to 2000.  [https://content.tfl.gov.uk/technical-note-10-what-is-the-capacity-of-the-road-network-for-private-motorised-traffic.pdf](https://content.tfl.gov.uk/technical-note-10-what-is-the-capacity-of-the-road-network-for-private-motorised-traffic.pdf)  \"There are numerous limitations on road capacity which make it highly unusual for roads to attain their stated design capacities\"\n\nBuses and light commercial vehicles / trucks could share the train route in some places, and this is another argument for narrow gauge being that we want to ideally avoid the tyres running on the steel to keep them in good condition. They could also share charging catenaries. On this point, this Japanese rail-bus concept could benefit from the narrow gauge as it should be easier to integrate the narrower width rail wheels and suspension with the conventional road wheels.

There are PRT vehicles that run on rubber tires, so you would just need some computer guidance to keep the ride smooth. \n\nRubber tire Trains\n\n[https://www.railpictures.net/images/d1/9/9/0/4990.1306122587.jpg](https://www.railpictures.net/images/d1/9/9/0/4990.1306122587.jpg)\n\n[https://journals.eco-vector.com/files/journals/18/articles/10993/supp/10993-23257-1-SP.jpg](https://journals.eco-vector.com/files/journals/18/articles/10993/supp/10993-23257-1-SP.jpg)\n\n[https://www.passengerterminaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rsz\\_tampa\\_international\\_airport\\_crystal\\_mover\\_apm-1.jpg](https://www.passengerterminaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rsz_tampa_international_airport_crystal_mover_apm-1.jpg)\n\nIf you want to move more people you can use rubber tire AGT/people mover style vehicles. Contrary to popular belief there are in fact rubber tire that don't have steel wheels for backup. AGT systems or people movers have trains that run completely on rubber tires. They have a computer system and guide-way to keep them aligned. They would just need a power source, either batteries or an external source. The Otis hovair trains are basically like tiny metro trains. You would just need to make them small enough to fit inside 14 foot tunnels.\n\nWith these changes the tunnels could provide either Personal Rapid Transit or Light Metro style service and be something other than an UBER in a tunnel.",

My solution was an electric Vespa, I don't need a license, the maintenance is cheaper, it's smaller, and keeping it fueled should be cheaper because it's electric. And then someone asked how much cheaper it was so I did the calculation and at 110v from the wall, and a battery with a capacity of 86 amp-hours\n\n110v * 86amp-hours = 9.46kWh\n\nAnd at an average rate for electricity in Indiana of 16 cents per kWh about, that places my Vespa at *$1.56 for a full charge.* which seems absolutely insane to me, but I can't find anything wrong with the calculation. Is it really that much cheaper to ditch cars? Even if I had to fully recharge is every day, that would still only be ~$600 a year for fueling it. This is absolutely staggering information to me. I've been a passionate urbanist and fuckcars supporter for a while and even I didn't realize until now how much cheaper it could really be.\n\nIs my calculation wrong somewhere or is it really just that much insanely cheaper to skip owning a car???",

      "text": " \n\nI always lived in Lisbon, born and rise in Bairro alto (famous for it´s pubs and crowded nighttime activity) and now I currently live in Benfica that is just next to Monsanto forest park the it´s a municipal protected forest in Lisbon, the largest green patch in the city, with almost 1000 ha, including a lot of mountain bike trials.\n\nHopefully I will be time to time sharing more bike routes, places to visit and good moments in Lisbon on my Tenways CGO600 :)\n\nSince the pandemic I have been discovering the awesome joy of riding an Ebike across the city and let me tell you, on two wheels it´s an excellent way of exploring and seeing the city. Since you can enjoy the beautiful view and it´s city vibes, plus getting some exercise and go to different spots relatively fast. All this in an ecofriendly way and with no additional costs! Yes no huge waits to get into public transports and paying expensive cabs/tourist bus.\n\nBy Facing the north Atlantic Ocean, it\u0019s home to a maritime climate, with an average annual temperature of 16 Degrees and sunny weather all year long, making it perfect for cycling in Portugal from July trough August until late September.\n\nThe cycle paths are not inter-connected, but they are a great way to explore certain parts of the capital. The city boasts about 100 km of bike lanes. Currently, not all are connected but the city is working to create a better cycling environment. The star is the riverside route which accompanies more than 20 km between the port on flat terrain, from the City Centre east towards Parque das Nações and west to the area of Belém.\n\nLisbon\u0019s cycle paths are one of the best ways to see the city. You just need to watch out for tourists and joggers using the path as a panoramic pavement. But there are many other cycle paths to discover Lisbon\n\nToday I will cover what was a great afternoon ride from just below Ponte 25 de Abril (our great bridge) and some of Lisbon\u0019s most iconic places to check while cycling trough the river towards Belem gardens:\n\nMy starting point for this leisure route, Ponte 25 de Abril! Just below the bridge for an awesome view (Doca de Santo Amaro, 1350-353 Lisboa, coordinates 38.698436, -9.178755). I enjoy so much relaxing a bit here, feeling the wind on my face and grasping the mesmerizing view. You really get a mix of vibes, from the trendy fancy restaurants behind you, the giant structure that is our bridge and the calming river across the two sides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgcshbst3bm91.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c890965aafb65df344875ceee6649d70756e29a3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kk4ussqu3bm91.jpg?width=1734&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60469968bbeaa7f5f5d800acada87a73b90fd31b\n\n\\- M.A.A.T. The Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology, the ultimate and top architectural attraction in Lisbon. This is a cultural project for the city of Lisbon that is focused on three areas - Art, Architecture, and Technology and they present national and international exhibitions by contemporary artists, architects, and thinkers. All this just by the seaside where you cross along the bike path towards Belem, also there is a lane next to it that allows you to reach the top of the building with your bike for some pics!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0656wgv3bm91.jpg?width=976&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7961970779c8dae807d1c351793cdc2d25d0fa7c\n\n\\- Monumento dos Descobrimentos (Monument of the Discovers) and we'll have the most beautiful of the Tagus River\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxcbvq7w3bm91.jpg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486d484b36ec6299291bb801f03a5ee8dac1fe75\n\n\\- Belém Tower and its garden, a great monument that typifies the Manueline style of architecture, a symbol of Portugal\u0019s great era of expansion. Built between 1514 and 1520, it originally served as a military base - a protective barrier between Lisbon and possible enemies trying to reach Portugal\u0019s waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It´s surrounded by a beautiful garden where a lot of families and tourist go to rest and sightseeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4jyxu97x3bm91.jpg?width=1806&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8aed713ff1542ccd8a910017969b7ba2548de8d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5abgrnyx3bm91.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19b6c376acbfbb2925a355f240760bf6a5b40de2\n\nNext to it across the road, you really must to go and taste the best \u001cPastel de Nata\u001d (world renown Portuguese custard tart) and drink a Ginjinha (traditional cherry liquor) before your way back, but not too much :)\n\nLink for the my last bike ride on this route so that you can also see the pathway I took on the map: [https://www.relive.cc/view/vXOdYnPN3k6](https://www.relive.cc/view/vXOdYnPN3k6)\n\nTenways CGO600 performance: Just simply great, seems taylored for this and believe me I´m not exaggerating! All the ride with a silent motor, like no one hears it. This may look like something pointless the believe me if you ride dozens of kilometers it will be something to take in consideration because it add´s to that feel of smoothness and just well built machine (most Ebike as noisy and some really noisy!)\n\npeaking about smoothness, well with a light weight Ebike (15kg) and an overall good built I couldn´t ask for better feeling at this price point. It really feels premium, from the starting point where you have instant assist thanks to the torque sensor, up until the 25km where the motor cuts off due to EU law. You can even reach 30km relatively easy with the strength of your legs if you so desire in a flat road.\n\nAll the hills I come across where tackled, the most big hill % at max assist level 3 where done with relatively effort which is great to get fit as well without getting tired. And Lisbon is by no means a flat road city :)\n\nAnother thing that I just love on this Ebike is the looks... The sporty geometry really stands out looking gorgeous, plus it feels comfortable to ride (of course like any other bike you need to choose the correct size, best way is to do a bike fit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulzvv06z3bm91.jpg?width=896&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=257f9e46b1ba9c73d5da6687672d16c6a3d2cfb3\n\nAnother thing that I absolutely love is the range on this, due to the light weight plus the battery specs is more than enough to do 40-50km riding with pedal assist 1, and if you are on flat road you can just switch off the assist at 20km and just ride like a normal bike saving battery for later.\n\nGot to say awesome product, thank you Tenways for allowing me to explore my city on an eco-friendly way. I really do feel that sincerity and passion were put into this product with quality at an affordable price.",

      "text": "In my case, we're talking about a standard ICE car here, not an electric or hybrid.\n\nI find that I generally don't drive more often than once per week, and even then, sometimes I feel like I'm doing it out of obligation. Reasons I've heard include keeping the seals from drying out and leaking, keeping the brakes from rusting, the fact that fuel has a limited lifespan and shouldn't be left sitting too long, something about circulating the fluids, and keeping rodents and pests from getting in. Of course, it helps that it keeps the battery charged as well, especially in the winter.\n\nI live in a suburban neighbourhood in a car-centric city. My house has a driveway but no garage, so my car is parked outdoors. I live within easy walking distance of a discount supermarket; moreover, I can cycle to the local commuter rail station in less than 10 minutes, mostly along a safe trail that is beautiful when it's not winter, and the remainder along low-traffic residential streets. Very close to the train station is a large plaza with a variety of businesses, a general store, and another supermarket. However, there are also some stores I may go to that are too far away to walk and too dangerous to cycle to. Plus, if I want to go to the city centre, I can drive for 20 minutes, or I can get there by bus in over an hour. It's also safe to cycle there, because there are multi-use paths all along the stroads that lead there, but that would take even longer.",

It would make fetching groceries easier. It would help me get more exercise.\n\nOn the con side: It would be *especially* costly because (owing to a balance issue) I will need an e-tricycle which are invariably three times more expensive than even a high-end e-bicycle. It would be adding a vehicle to the streets and another battery pack to the world. The running costs would actually be higher than what I'm doing now.\n\nWhat do you think? \nIs it worth taking up cycling if public transport will do?",

      "text": "Disclaimer: This post is more political than usual and would probably be better suited for r/left_urbanism but I'll post it here first.\n\nIt's no secret that the auto industry is one of the most profitable industries racking in over $32 billion through the third quarter of 2022 just in the United States. The auto along with the oil industry and their lobbyist continue to push back against the bare minimum of policies to address climate change and the environment all while mistreating their workers and preventing people from building a more walkable, liveable society.\n\n[https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/business/2023/09/15/auto-makers--record-profits-should-be-shared--president-says](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/business/2023/09/15/auto-makers--record-profits-should-be-shared--president-says)\n\nAs to why the auto industry is so successful and profitable? Unlike something like fancy shoes or fidget spinners, cars (at least in the United States) are necessary to participate in society, without them (cars) for intensive purposes you can't survive in many places.\n\nCars are needed if you need to find a job, cars are needed to get groceries or whatever, and you need a car to go to work to make some money only to spend most of that cash on refueling and maintaining that car. All while the auto and gas industry racks in the big bucks. And since modern cars are planned to become obsolete in a few years, people need to buy a new one or risk even more financial loss due to a major breakdown. Not to mention that if your car breaks down in a car-dependent area, you're stranded.\n\nNot to be hyperbolic, but cars and car-centric design keep poor people poor and encourage consumerism because rather than walking outside or going to a public swimming pool or gym, people buy home equipment because those public places have been gutted. Car dependency contributes to alienation and isolation meaning that especially for younger people, they spend their time online playing video games because either the outside environment is boring or outright hostile to pedestrians. Not to mention the environmental devastation cars cause not only from direct air pollution but also roads and highways cutting nature and communities (usually African-American communities) in half, encouraging suburban sprawl, and the amount of space and asphalt reserved for cars. Needless to say, car-centric design is bad.\n\nBut okay, that's just capitalism doing its thing, pursuing profits and enriching the 1% at the expense of everybody else. (Right-wing libertarians can screw off, they lack the cognitive ability to think and shouldn't be taken seriously, because once you remove their mask, they're just Fasc\\*sts).\n\n[https://medium.com/discourse/the-libertarian-to-fascist-pipeline-is-shorter-than-you-think-2f2a98b2690e](https://medium.com/discourse/the-libertarian-to-fascist-pipeline-is-shorter-than-you-think-2f2a98b2690e)\n\nBut how does that relate to imperialism? I'll get to that, don't you worry, but first, some definitions. The textbook definition of imperialism is that of \"a policy of extending a country's power and influence through diplomacy or military force.\"\n\nAn Overt example of Imperialism is that of the British and French Empire colonizing Africa and the \"New World\" with British and French people directly controlling the colony while being backed with military force. Nowadays, imperialism is more hidden through financial power and influence rather than direct military force and through Neo-colonialism where \"the use of economic, political, cultural, or other pressures to control or influence other countries, especially former dependencies.\" With definitions out of the way, if you're a decent human being, you should agree that imperialism of all types is bad.\n\nBut not to get you too depressed on how crappy our world is, let's get back to the subject. So, what does imperialism have to do with cars? In the days of overt imperialism, cars played a role in patrolling remote villages and reaching areas that were inaccessible by railways or waterways. Cars and trucks were also used in logistics as while they lacked the capacity of ships and trains, they had flexibility on their side.\n\nTo be fair, trains were used in imperialist ventures but mostly in logistics as they *are* the most efficient mode of transportation, able to carry tons of goods and personnel. But I doubt trains were ever a direct product of imperialism where someone is like \"A yes, we're here to claim this land in the name of locomotive manufacturing.\" Trains were mainly used on the logistical side of imperialism and weren't necessarily a direct product of it. The same, however, can't be said for automobiles.\n\n[https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/feb2020/Role-Of-Automobiles-On-British-Imperialism-In-Colonial-Assam.pdf](https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/feb2020/Role-Of-Automobiles-On-British-Imperialism-In-Colonial-Assam.pdf)\n\nOn the maternal side of my family, my mom and grandparents originally lived in Cambodia in what was once formally known as French Indochina. They fled to Canada as refugees in the late 1970s due to the war and violence that ravaged the region but to stay on topic, one resource that the French controlled was rubber extraction. Not surprisingly, rubber is used in car tires, and even with synthetic rubber, the French held their control of Indochina before eventually being forced out.\n\n[https://academic.oup.com/book/3156/chapter-abstract/144018886?redirectedFrom=fulltext](https://academic.oup.com/book/3156/chapter-abstract/144018886?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\n\nAnother resource that is crucial to the operations of automobiles is oil/gasoline. The oil memes of the United States are very much true as the US either has dealings with shady, authoritarian governments like Saudi Arabia or outright invades another country for control over its resources, namely oil. A prime example is the Invasion of Iraq and no, the United States couldn't care less about \"Freedom and Democracy\" abroad. (To be unbiased, modern-day Russia is imperialist as well).\n\n[https://www.currentaffairs.org/2023/05/the-worst-crime-of-the-21st-century](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2023/05/the-worst-crime-of-the-21st-century)\n\nEven with the production of EVs, imperialism is still at the core of their production as exploitative labor practices are used to extract rare earth minerals, namely cobalt and lithium to create the batteries used to power the electric cars. I mean, just look at Elon Musk and Tesla, I hope you get the picture.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism\\_of\\_Tesla,\\_Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Tesla,_Inc)\n\nOf course, there's more to imperialism than building and operating cars but it shouldn't be surprising or controversial to say that the methods by which resources that are needed for the manufacturing, maintaining, and fueling of automobiles are built off of the blood of people who are colonized and exploited in the imperial periphery.\n\nI'm not trying to persuade you to take a certain political position or something like that as this isn't my political account and I want to reach a broader audience, but I'm merely observing the world around us. While cars aren't the sole product built from imperialism, they are a major one and a profitable one, especially the oil to fuel them. All that I can say is that by acknowledging the plights of people in the imperial periphery and hearing their stories and struggles, we can build a more equal and just world. Plus, the Urban-Planning to leftist and vice versa pipeline (or should I say railway) is very much real. =©=\n\n[https://www.currentaffairs.org/2023/07/anti-imperialism-is-both-morally-correct-and-absolutely-necessary-for-the-left](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2023/07/anti-imperialism-is-both-morally-correct-and-absolutely-necessary-for-the-left)\n\nPS: You don't have to agree with my position or the articles I've cited, but do be respectable and open-minded.

This would happen at a dedicated section of the platform segregated from passengers.\n\nIn the US there was the inter-urban concept, and in the UK we have slower regional passenger rail, which are suitable speeds for freight services and mixing these services may make sense, with both mixed trains and dedicated freight or passenger trains sharing the route at the same speeds with a few passing loops. I would think this sort of service might be limited to about 60 to 70 mph, or less on some routes at about 50 mph, and such services are designed to be cheap to install on account of the slower speed - the vehicles may be self powered multiple units that are autonomous and not require continuous electrification. Fuel cells, and batteries, are coming along as viable alternatives for these lower power applications, and they can recharge at sections of the route where unloading is not required.\n\nDedicated freight trains and passenger trains may also share these routes but at a harmonised speed to maximise frequency.\n\nIn urban areas trams may share those routes, or freight may be transferred to freight trams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "Idea for more flexible transportation",
      "text": "So I had this idea recently that I\u0019ve been playing with in my mind and I wanted to throw it out to see what you all think.\n\nSelf driving cars have been touted as some saviour to traffic but the reality is, it may just make things even worse. It just means more people taking more unnecessary trips and ultimately more cars on the road.\n\nWhat if instead we made a self driving vehicle with seating for 20. 4 seats in each row with all of the rows not accessible to each other. Have 1 row with 4 seats together (for larger groups/family) and the remaining 4 rows with a divider in the middle creating 8 two seat areas that are separate from all other seats.\n\nIf you could open an app and order a ride on demand, this self driving car would come and open a specific door for you. With enough people using the service, you could have most seats filled during rush hour traffic with little more commute time as an algorithm would be able to determine the best people to group into the same car (e.g. they are all going to the arcade from a similar area).\n\nBy using electric power and not having a lot of room to haul stuff around they could be the same size as a normal car. With this being more for just commuting in the city, you could use half the batteries or perhaps even less just fill up more often thereby greatly reducing the impact to the environment from lithium mining.\n\nDuring non-peak times the vehicle may only have 1 passenger but will be able to more efficiently transport during rush hour. \n\nOk, I can hear it. I know what you are thinking: it\u0019s called a bus, stupid (insert car brain insults). This solves a few other problems though: \n\nPeople don\u0019t really like being around other people. Some of the complaints about buses is that there are \u001cunsavoury people\u001d they have to be around and that buses may not be safe for children. Self driving buses would have no one to monitor the situation and there could be more crime on buses if they went the self driving route.\n\nFurther to the last point, buses are not safe for kids where as a completely separated area helps to make this safe while in the vehicle.\n\nBuses just keep driving around even when no one is there to pick up. I realize this may be very short lived but it happens.\n\nSome cities have areas where the density is too low to have buses run all the time. This makes the use of public transportation very difficult whereas a vehicle that picks you up on demand could work.\n\nBuses stop running at a certain point. This means that some people think they still need a car. An on demand service completely takes away that excuse.\n\nThis type of vehicle could transport 60+ people a day and may be able to service up to 30 people and replace 15-20 cars. I just pulled these numbers out of my ass, but they seem reasonable to me.\n\nOf course this would take a huge percentage of the population to make it would BUT could greatly reduce traffic and the need for as many roads.\n\nA few notes: \n\nIf your party is larger than 4, you can use more than 1 area.\n\nPeople could pay extra to get a 2 seat pod to themselves (pay for both seats)\n\nParking could just be on the streets where they are most likely to be needed next.\n\nYou would need a way to build charging stations everywhere and they would have to be a very high amp to charge quickly and save on power. Where you would build these and how you get permission to do this would be hard to figure out. You would want it to be automatic as well.\n\nIf someone needed to move something or have more than a backpack or suitcase, they would need to use something else.\n\nThis doesn\u0019t solve all vehicle needs but does cover the majority of trips people need. More people could probably go to 1 vehicle or including a truck rental (self driving, comes to your door) service for 500% more cost could be a good option as sometimes (though very rarely) people need that.\n\nI also realize this would be hard in smaller cities.\n\nThoughts? Critics are welcome to poke holes in my argument!",

      "text": "trains are most awesome thing on frequented routes - they are cheap, reliable, easy to automate, comfortable and fast, but wait times on non-frequented routes is the issue, as well as overal low utilitization of existing tracks, which increase train ticket costs and make it prohibitively expensive to build tracks to more remote places.  \nObvious solution would be to do basically autonomous cars on tracks - much easier to automate than cars, autonomous means no need to park, or can move to remote parking space and most of the tracks are electrified, so you get all the benefits of electric vehicle with none of the drawbacks of batteries.  \nObviously it would need at least two tracks per route, same as road (two way roads), but it could utilize unused time of existing tracks, as well as cheaper new routes, because it wouldn\u0019t need to carry as much weight per axle.  \nOf course, it would be more expensive to build and maintain compared to trains (per passenger), but cheaper than autonomous EVs, but infrastructure would get cheaper, as it will be used more, so the costs will be divided by more customers.  \nI am surely not the first one to think of this, so my question is, what am I missing?

      "text": "tl;dr) I didn't have $1k for a ebike, I did have $150 to turn my $60 schwann into a moped. I think they're a viable way to get people on a budget onto bikes and out of cars, and aren't talked about enough. Thoughts?\n\nThere's been some pretty active ebike threads lately (which are always awesome!), but that means its also time to talk about ebike's less shiny, estranged 3rd cousin: 2-stroke bike conversions.\n\nI've always wanted an ebike, but like many people get skiddish when I start looking at price tags. Ebikes seem to start at around $1k for reputable brands, and very easily make it up to $4-5k for something winter-worthy which can move a bigger dude. I know that there are cheap conversion kits and posts by DIY battery-builders who can convert a bike for less than $500, but when it comes to strapping a ~~bomb~~ battery between my legs I would prefer not pinch pennies. And before someone mentions how an ebike is cheaper than a car: I agree, but for most people (including myself) abandoning my car is not an option at the moment, so any sort of alternative transport is frankly a luxury.\n\nThis is where I feel like a 2-stroke kit can come in to get people who live 10 miles from work on a bike w/o the $1k+ investment. Conversion kits are cheap and easy to assemble (\\~$150 [https://bicyclemotorworks.com/product/standard-silver-6680cc-bike-engine-kit/](https://bicyclemotorworks.com/product/standard-silver-6680cc-bike-engine-kit/)), and have the power/range of a much more expensive ebike. I acknowledge that gas bikes are less than perfect: they're loud, harder to maintain than an ebike (still quite easy, however), and consume fossil fuels/produce pollution. They can't be taken as easily on public transportation, are legally vague in most places, and still pose their own hazards if handled poorly. But even a shitty moped can easily make 100-150mpg, and while 2-stroke engines are inherently dirtier than 4-stroke cars a [2013 EPA study of 2-stroke bikes](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/94004K13.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1976%20Thru%201980&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C76THRU80%5CTXT%5C00000039%5C94004K13.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=3) showed that mopeds produce \"high hydrocarbons and NO \\[per mile\\] compared with automobiles, \\[but\\] low CO2, very low (if any) NOx and very good fuel economy\".\n\nThoughts?",

Not sure how effective they are. I've thought of powering a car with one, but the shape and size of it might defeat the purpose. It might not be enough power to haul something or even move. Pedaling powers the battery of the car to move it. A van is a better option, but even if there is enough power for sustainable movement, how to control the van. The driver's feet are occupied. Given this is something feasible, it would work best in a train. Possibly with multiple people pedaling. If this is stupid, it won't happen.

It's nicer now, but there's definitely still plenty of traffic lol  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Them** no you don't *understand!* the cars will be self driving so it will be perfectly efficient!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me** ... the cars are bumper to bumper in the tunnels now... how are you gonna make it \"more efficient\" by minimizing the distance any more?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Them** psh. You just don't *get it*\n\nAnd my absolute favorite is when they overcomplicate the absolute most simple things imaginable\n\n&gt;**Me** what if instead of optimizing cars we just optimized how we structured the city itself? Look, the parking lot is bigger than the grocery store. Those apartments are build way over there. What if we just... used mixed use zoning, got rid of the parking lot, and put it all together so the distance is negligible and you can just kind of... you know... walk there? You don't need to bring complex technology into this solution  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Them** ... but... wait... if I can't *drive* to the grocery store, how will I fill my SUV up with food for the entire week? I don't get it, are you dumb? You must be dumb lol, you're just not thinking  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me** uh. you just kinda... get what you need for a day? The grocery store is so close that you can just go again if you need more, it's no longer a task, you just work it into your daily routine  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Them** (face as if their brain is making the AOL dial up noise) but... if no parking, then where would my car be?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me** maybe you don't actually need one? Maybe we shouldn't build society around every single person owning a car to accomplish every menial task?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Them** *You think I shouldn't have a car? But I* ***need*** *my car! If I don't have my car, how will I get to the grocery store?!!?!?*\n\nIt's all just so exhausting to fight with people who think they're mega-brains when really they're pretty average",

      "text": "Not sure if this has been posted yet.. couldn't find it anyways - but we got featured in Carbrain monthly! Be sure to check out the comments section for some great nuanced takes from the car persons. (/s)\n\n[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you imagine your life without a car or a truck? Do you see yourself biking to work or taking the bus every single day? Are you ready to carry groceries and supplies like in the old days? Well, this is what some people are dreaming of. We\u0019re not talking about 100, 1,000, or 10,000 people. No, there are over 217,000 supporters of the anti-car movement! It\u0019s worth understanding what they want, since these ideas tend to spread like wildfire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to a subreddit that has a very explicit name, people that are in favor of banning cars are not looking to make emergency vehicles disappear, they don\u0019t want to disrupt the supply chains dependent on trucks, and don\u0019t look at rural communities to make their plan happen. They also underline that the initiative isn\u0019t political and doesn\u0019t adhere to any set of \u001cleft\u001d or \u001cright\u001d values and beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What these guys and gals wish is to make everyone aware of the cost that we must all support because cars became so important for almost anything we do. This is clearer now that we\u0019ve all gradually returned to normal office hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-car community essentially agrees that building the roads and the needed utilities creates \u001can unwanted economic burden on communities\u001d that has proven to be costly everywhere, especially when you look at the yearly amount of dollars spent on maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they say this won\u0019t stop with the switch to all-electric and self-driving cars, since charging and moving around without human control will almost certainly guarantee the number of vehicles won\u0019t come down, and more money will be needed for charging and resting spots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Not enough room for everyone**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People also think cities give too much space to cars, parking, and gas or charging stations. They want more parks, schools, homes, and businesses instead of vehicles in populated urban areas. Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand, which translates into more cars everywhere if roads are widened and parking spots are created.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These online activists also underline that not everyone can simply buy and drive a vehicle. They say children, teenagers, impoverished parents and adults, and those unable to drive suffer a lot in \u001ccar-centric cities.\u001d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-car movement supporters also argue motor vehicles are dangerous. Occupants may benefit from increased levels of protection as automotive technology evolves and companies create new materials that are lighter, stronger, yet dissipate impact energy in a very efficient way, but those that are not in a car might not survive an impact with one \u0013 something that everybody knows since childhood. But these people insist exercising any *\u001cform of car-free liberty\u001d* is automatically linked to constant threat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They also say cars are nurturing isolation, since people don\u0019t meet so often to have a chat on a sidewalk. You may be inclined to bring up car communities and events, but keep in mind activists are only referring to city life. Urban dwellers might enjoy some more space for weekend activities or just walk to and from work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A change must happen, but not like this**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, the idea to ban cars remains a discussion on [a popular forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/). But the number of people that agree with this idea is frightening. It\u0019s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much, but giving up on fossil fuels and designing better cities might just do the trick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A change is clearly needed, but it can\u0019t happen without motor vehicles. They are an integral part of the U.S. (and the world) and of a major industry, while some certain models create entire communities, and even inspire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All in all, banning cars from public roads and crowded cities might be applicable in specific cases or in some locations, but the U.S. is not ready in any way, shape, or form to give up entirely on motor vehicles. New York City is already struggling with keeping traffic under control after they\u0019ve made more space for bicycles and buses. People have various needs when it comes to reaching different destinations, and we can\u0019t take the comfort of knowing they can go everywhere they need at any given time without offering a public infrastructure that\u0019s working continuously and without delays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle, be it a battery-electric or a fuel-cell (hydrogen) one.",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That\u0019s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.\u001d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/air-pollution-in-nsw-causes-603-premature-deaths-and-costs-48bn-a-year-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\n**The NSW Clean Air Strategy 2021-2030**\n\n\nDoes address cars and trucks with:\n\n*Zero Emissions Bus Transition Strategy* to transition to electric battery buses and hydrogen fuel cell technology. \n\n*Walking and Cycling Program*  to create cycling and walking connections/parths around Sydney.\n\n *NSW Electric Vehicle Strategy* to increase electric vehicle use through government rebates and building charges.",

      "title": "I just realize that most Tesla Owners would rather buy a New Car than replace their old batteries..",
      "text": "TL. DR.  Tesla Owners might choose to buy a new car than repair their old ones.\n\nBecause of depreciation, the value of an old depreciated Tesla + the price of new batteries is very high compared to just buying a new Tesla without wear and tear.\n\nI made [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/uj1shk/its_almost_like_theyre_made_to_be_disposible/) earlier, but after pondering at it for a while, I remember how car depreciation works. And I realized that the value of the car would be a lot less after a short amount of time and then the curve slowly plateaus sometime later. Then it hit me, what if repairing an old car is not worth it for car owners? What if the price of a brand new car is so cheap that depreciation kills the incentive of repairing old cars?\n\nSo I researched. A brand new standard Tesla is worth less than $42,000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cq45di1pxox81.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6baee68967e55c694e12d451179c618f14b515e3\n\nAnd according to [this](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2021/12/30/tesla-exploded-dynamite-repair-costs-22k-moos-pkg-vpx.cnn) viral video, the price to replace the batteries of a tesla, at least for him was $22,000; Over half of its purchasing price. That sounds good right?\n\nNo, because according to the depreciation of cars, they lose HALF their value in the first 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9clkbbiyox81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5b543f5872e839d84e97923a75fd7b58d0b4942\n\nAnd in 8 years they lose 75% of their value.\n\nNow okay, I will make it clear, the graph is for gasoline and diesel-powered cars, so it might sound like I'm comparing apples to oranges. But on the contrary, it might be much worse, as Tesla cars are getting better and better improvements at faster rates. SO THE DEPRECIATION WOULD PROBABLY BE WORSE.\n\nAnd according to [here](https://getoptiwatt.com/blog/how-long-will-your-tesla-battery-really-last) the Tesla battery life is just 8 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5grbws8zox81.png?width=314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdc98a50438aeb048f152577de3e641bb0e0208c\n\nSo in a few years time we will be having car owners with the choice of repairing their cars valued at less than $11,000  and costing them $22,000 or buying a new one entirely for just double that.\n\nAnd this is potentially worse after 16 years, with more parts of the cars depreciating in reliability the value of just buying a new car gets even sweeter.\n\nSo we can almost say that Tesla is selling disposable cars.",

I don't want a new, bigger car right now. \n\nI'm having my first baby, and have been told multiple times that that means I absolutely need an SUV. A few reasons:\n- bending over to put the car seat in will hurt your back (I'm short - reaching and climbing into a tall car isn't exactly comfortable either) \n- it's safer (not if it has blind spots the size of a small country)\n- it'll fit all the gear better (maybe legit, idk but I need to figure that out on my own. I'd rather carry less gear anyways) \n\nI've told people that I'm saving up for an electric car, but apparently that's unsafe because \"what if the baby needs to go to the hospital and there's a power outage and the car battery is dead?\" Like omg, that's not going to happen all at once. \n\nI guess everyone is just really, really anxious about kids, and buying things that are marketed as \"safe\" can be soothing. I wish that our carbrained society didn't have this fixation - babies are expensive and wasteful enough without requiring a $40k gas guzzling carriage.\n\nInfo: I'm in Canada.

      "text": "I've never ridden an electric bike. But I'm familiar with modern battery and motor tech, and how far it has come in the past several years. An E-bike allows you to traverse great distances at speeds similar or greater than the average speed of a car stuck in traffic. You're outside, getting fresh air, and getting a bit of exercise too. If the battery runs out or the motor fails, you just pedal, and can easily maintain a running/jogging speed with the same effort it takes to walk. You can park it pretty much anywhere. They're basically free to operate compared to a car, new tires for an E-bike might be 100 bucks tops, meanwhile my tiny miata was 400 for the cheapest all season tires I could find. Not to mention the lack of oil changes or other maintenance that comes with a large internal combustion engine. The infrastructure for an E-bike is cheap and easy to maintain, too. And, of course, the almost complete lack of pollution caused by manufacturing and operating one. I have no idea why E-bikes aren't more popular, aside from areas with insufficient infrastructure to support them. I guess most people still see them as overpriced toys.\n\nEdit: In case it isn't obvious, It's gonna depend on your use case. If you commute half a mile and have to deal with stairs, a regular bike is better. If you live in an area with no bike paths, a motorcycle or scooter might be better. I'm glad I've spurred so much conversation on the topic!",

      "text": "&gt;July 29, 2024\n\n&gt;The report makes it clear that DOT isn't the only agency that will be blamed if we can't clean up our transportation system \u0014 Congress, state highway offices, and local leaders all need to take a hard look in the mirror if they want to prevent the worst.\n\n&gt;That's in large part, the report suggests, because no level of government has been aggressive enough about reducing how much Americans drive. One recent study cited in the paper found that the only path to meaningful emissions reduction that still allowed for VMT growth required both 80 percent of the vehicle fleet to be electrified by 2050, and the total decarbonization of the electrical grid \u0014 and even then, it just barely squeaked in under the line. Meanwhile, experts estimate that only 30 percent of cars will have batteries by midcentury.\n\n&gt;Or, as the report authors put it bluntly: \"The U.S. will not be able to decarbonize the transportation sector by midcentury without addressing increased demand.\" \n\n&gt;That harsh reality was also underscored in more subtle ways throughout the report, which routinely placed policies that support biking, walking, transit, and other non-automotive modes at the top of its various lists of decarbonization strategies.\n\n&gt;Specifically, DOT says the agency and all of its partners in government will need to \"increase convenience\" by decreasing the distance Americans need to travel to key destinations (and the safety they can expect along the journey), as well as \"improving efficiency\" by supporting mass transportation and better freight strategies.\n\n&gt;\"Increasing clean options\" like electric vehicles was the third item on its list. \n\n(editorial continues)\n\nChart: https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2024/07/AEO-chart.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75\n\n[https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/feds-warns-congress-that-americans-need-to-drive-less-to-survive-climate-change)\n\nFound the post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/1efhtm9/usdot_warns_congress_that_americans_need_to_drive/ (do not vote if you're not a subscriber there)",

      "title": "It's a shame that many National Parks in North American are only (reliably) accessible by cars",
      "text": "One of the great ironies of National Parks in North America, namely in Canada and the US is that they're only reliably accessible by personal automobile. I shouldn't have to tell you how terrible cars are for animals and the environment. There's the direct consequences like collisions (roadkill), road noise, tire particles, constant traffic, habitat loss resulting from just how much space cars, roads, highways, and parking lots take up. \n\nCars kill thousands of people each year, and millions of animals, if it's unsafe for people to cross a highway, it's definitely unsafe for animals to cross. Even though some of the highways crossing through forests have these wildlife crossing bridges, these bridges wouldn't have to exist if it weren't for cars and highways cutting the forest in half!\n\n[This wouldn't need to exist if it weren't for cars!](https://preview.redd.it/n58xou3vzjad1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e25d71d8079d66cd8829efa3acb3e9a7e4d53a4)\n\nThen there's the indirect consequences like air pollution both local and global, cars encouraging sprawling suburbs, mining and extracting resources like oil, metal, etc for the production and maintenance of cars, imperialism, invasions, and wars for said resources \\*cough\\* \\*cough\\* US invasion of Iraq, exploitative labor practices and literal child slaves for lithium mining for battery electrics cars! I could go on about how terrible cars are both physically, environmentally, and socially, but I'll focus on the irony on how many National Parks are only accessible by car.\n\nIt's ironic how the only way to \"experience true nature\" is for someone to hop into a usually gas-guzzling car, drive it down a highway that cuts the forest in half, only to [mow down a rare white brown bear and her cubs in the process](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/). Needless to say, f\\*ck cars, and especially f\\*ck them if they're used to drive through a National Park. And the gall of calling these parks \"protected lands\" while allowing cars to drive through them?! If you want to protect land, prohibit cars from driving there!\n\nOne of the biggest threats facing animals in natural areas isn't human hunters, poachers, or invasive species, but cars! Cars both directly and indirectly are the biggest killers of animals, and it's a shame that most National Parks are only accessible by cars, the biggest threat to animals.\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nI'm not saying that there shouldn't be parks for people to visit as people just walking on trails and such do not greatly disturb wildlife. However, driving there in a car shouldn't be the only option if an option at all. \n\nWhile there are unfortunately collisions between trains on ground level tracks and animals, the number of \"roadkill\" is significantly lower than with cars and measures can be taken to prevent this. As to why train collisions with animals are lower? Firstly, railway tracks do not take up a lot of space compared to a highway. All you need for a railway to be efficient is a double track, and even with larger North American loading gauges, at most all you need is about 7.5 meters width, the equivalent of two highways lanes (correct me if I'm wrong about North American train loading gauges).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kemivdb9ckad1.jpg?width=509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ec593632f618091cb65e04c75c7076bc78b5e8\n\nSecondly, even a frequent railway line with trains every ten minutes is nowhere near the constant, never-ending traffic of a highway. With trains every ten minutes or longer, it allows for animals to cross.\n\nAnd thirdly, it seems like animals are just better adapted around trains than with cars. Rather than worrying about dozens of cars when trying to cross a highway, they only have to deal with one train on tracks that take up less space, meaning there's lower risk when crossing. We've all seen birds and such hang out around train tracks without issue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbdkl9liakad1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b99d181006d8cbcf13c7ee5e21f2c7e0c257e46\n\nNow, in the unfortunately [story with the rare white brown bear](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/), if I read the article correctly, the mother was grazing in the ditch near the train tracks. Now when the metal wheels screeched against the rails, it startled her, I mean who wouldn't get startled by train wheels screeching, I would as trains are relatively quiet except for wheel screech. The startled mother bear unfortunately ran up from the ditch and onto the highway where she was struck and killed.\n\n\"It's the train that scared her onto the highway! If it weren't for the train, she wouldn't have gotten struck!\" A car brain would say. Keep in mind that the bear knew to stay off the train tracks, and that it was the car that made the killing blow. If the highway wasn't there and the bear did got startled, she would've gone back to the ditch and continue on grazing. Not to mention cars kill animals regardless if there's a train track nearby or not. The train didn't kill her, the cars did!\n\nNow, one way to mitigate the impacts that railways have in an forested area, at least once construction is complete is to have the tracks elevated on viaducts as it allows for the train to be fully grade separated while allowing for animals to cross underneath.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4htsj1agakad1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a6cd178cbbf672fd3d4dc89d8d9a0c5197fed3\n\nWhile all human activity does impact wildlife, having elevated railways probably has the lowest impact as once construction is complete, it doesn't cut the forest in half like a surface highway for the elevated tracks allows for animals to cross beneath it safely without having to worry about getting struck.\n\nIt's a shame that most National Parks in North America are only accessible by car, the worst mode of transport for animals' wellbeing due to how many animals cars kill. To preserve our National Parks, we have to restrict cars from entering them due to said negative effects. At best, have elevate trains to them. At the bear minimum, use buses that can take a good 50-100 cars off the road.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yko469ebbkad1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc60d6a7661254b040e5f360fed1bae291a08283\n\nBy limiting and/or prohibiting cars from driving through National Parks can we preserve and truly enjoy the wonders of the natural world.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uhyaujlbkad1.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c06d21a44a3e5a9f173e3781fe668a9fa32b7ba\n\n",

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that.

      "text": "No matter the reason, whether it be pumping out oversized pickup trucks and SUVs, lying about the emissions of their vehicles, actively promoting a car-centric lifestyle, peddling to reactionaries to buy their pickups, shady and unethical business practices, etc. \n\nWhile all auto manufacturers (and most companies) are guilty of unethical practices, it's in the financial interests of the auto manufacturers to ensure a car-centric lifestyle so that people are dependent upon their produces. \n\nRegardless of your reasoning, let me know which auto manufacturer you dislike the most as I'll share you mine. Probably on the top of my list has to be Tesla. \n\nGoing off their products, the notion that battery-electric cars are environmentally friendly is laughable as \n\nA. Electric cars need lots of rare Earth minerals that are mined via slave child labor. \n\nB. Said mining practices are not only unethical but destructive to the environment. \n\nC. Cars are just inherently bad for the environment not just through direct emissions because they require a lot of space which means more forests have to be paved over for roads and parking lots, said surface parking lot creates the urban heat island effect, cars are inefficient and they don't last long mostly due to planned obsolescence, cars kill so many animals directly through road-kill, and cars kill thousands of people each year, and the \"self-driving\" feature of Tesla cars are flawed and shady.\n\nD. Tesla cars burst into flames.\n\nHowever, my primary reason for hating Telsa has to be Elon Musk. Rant warning: Elon Musk is a racist, white South \"African\" i.e settler who got rich off of his parents' emerald mine, has a fucking cult of stans who worship him like he's a God Emperor, and attacks anyone who questions their messiah, and turned Twitter (I refuse to call it X) into a cesspool of racist, reactionary content. He uses child labor in the lithium mines, abuses the workers in the Tesla factories, disregarding their safety, and is just a giant piece of shit. Fuck Elon Musk, Fuck his culty stans, and if anyone drives a Telsa car, note that they are complicit in child labor and exploitation and that they're giving money to a racist piece of shit.\n\n(I know there's no ethical consumption under our current system, but at least try to minimize the impact by not purchasing products from companies that openly practice unethical procedures).\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Tesla is number one on my list of most hated auto manufacturers with Ford being a close second for similar reasons as Henry Ford was an anti-Semitic piece of shit. Let me know what's number one on your list and your reasoning for that. Take care, and stay safe.",

I don't think that a driver is actually thinking \"I should speed now because then I will be home earlier\". I think it is nothing more than a feeling.\n\nIf I use myself as example, 'speeding' on my ebike, why do I do it? Not because it makes me arrive home earlier, but because it feels good. I know that going 30 instead of 27 km/h only saves me 13 seconds per kilometer and that the difference in battery consumption is huge and that its less safe and that while I can get away with 27  30 can get me a big fine, but I still do it because going slower than physically possible on a long straight empty path just feels uncomfortable.\n\nI imagine that for motorvehicle drivers its the same. They don't care as much about time saved as the uncomfortable feeling that slowing down brings.\n\nYou can tell a driver that 130 -&gt; 140 will only save 2 seconds per kilometer but the driver will probably still drive 140 km/h where only 130 is allowed.\n\nIs my theory correct?",

He passes by a bike that's chained up against a streetpost. I see that the rear light of the bike is glowing red. He walks towards it, past it, and then pauses. Then he doubles back and leans down towards the bike. For a moment, I think he's going to remove the light and pocket it. But instead he simply reaches down, find the off switch, switches it off, and then wanders off, on his merry way. \n\nHe doesn't know that anyone is watching him, but it doesn't matter. I guess he's probably also a cyclist. He could have taken the free bike light (you can never have too many), or he could have just sauntered past. But instead he stopped, just to turn out the light so that it might go unnoticed by other passers-by, and to save the owner the hassle of finding his light suddenly out of battery the next evening. \n\nI'm not sure what this story has to do with cars. Maybe it's just your run-of-the-mill good person. But i saw it as some act of solidarity, and it struck a chord with me because I also do that whenever I walk past someone's bike where the lights are left on.",

      "title": "Should transit become cheaper per person when you\u0019re travelling with more people?",
      "text": "For a bit of context, my family and I went to a neighbouring city today to eat at a restaurant there to celebrate my upcoming birthday. We do this every year on or around my birthday but this year I asked that we would all take the train and then the bus to the restaurant when we got there. My parents are very used to driving everywhere so I wanted to show them how easy it can be, and I saw this as a good chance to make them try it. My dad is more hesitant about it than my mom, but since I was literally asking for it on my birthday he also gave in.. until I brought up the price. \n\nFor my entire family, three adults and two youths, it came to about 633 SEK or about ¬55. This is for a 24 hour ticket for the entire region, so it included the train and the bus. (24 hour tickets are the same price as 2 one way tickets so if you\u0019re going there and back you might as well.) My dad has a hybrid car, with a battery that lasts pretty much to this city one way, so he only uses gas on the way home. Because 5 people in the car costs just as much as one person in the car, it would have cost us about 60 SEK in gas or about ¬5 to do this by car. I don\u0019t know how expensive parking is but it wouldn\u0019t have made much of a dent in the order of magnitude price difference. He thought it would be ridiculous to pay 10 times more for a slightly less convenient trip, and I honestly can\u0019t blame him for thinking that. \n\nMy dad didn\u0019t refuse to or anything but I felt like it would take the fun out of it if I knew he just thought it was a massive waste, so in the end only me, my brother and mother took the train essentially because we felt like it, and my dad and sister went by car. The ticket for the three of us cost 390 SEK (¬32).\n\nWith this pricing, for every person above one that travels by public transit it becomes less and less logical financially, even if you compare it to a regular gas car. If you\u0019re a family it really disincentivises using transit unless you\u0019re determined to for some other reason, and me and both my parents agree this is kind of dumb. If traveling 5 people was a bit less, maybe even considerably less per person than it is when traveling alone, it would probably make a lot more people choose transit over driving when traveling together. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\nNote: It was this expensive because the ticket covered the whole region of the country, which is Sweden by the way. You need a ticket like this to travel between any of the three major cities. If you\u0019re traveling within just one of these cities the prices are half of this.",

      "text": "I've had this thought rumbling around in my head for several years now and I've never heard it expressed anywhere. If you listen very many Elon Musk interviews (not recommended) you'll eventually hear him explain how he uses First Principles Thinking to solve engineering problems. The idea is you boil things down to their most fundamental level and work backwards from those simple truths. A classic example is: Electric cars are cost prohibitive because batteries are expensive. OK, well what are batteries even made of? If the raw cost of the materials is low then it stands to reason the cost can be lowered through improving the manufacturing process.\n\nOK, fair enough.\n\nHowever, using First Principles Thinking totally undermines the electric green car fantasy in terms of its ability to solve or mitigate the energy / climate crisis, or even traffic problems. We're asking the wrong question, namely: \"What is the most efficient way to transport every person 30 miles every day using a 4,000lb machine?\" The answer to that question very well may be either a Prius or an electric car. But it's a fucking idiotic question, and constrains your thinking by boxing you in to a particular solution space.\n\nThe correct question is: \"What is the most efficient way to transport everyone in the country to their daily needs, namely: work, school, shopping, and activities?\" And of course the answer is that it's orders of magnitude more efficient to build compact mixed use small towns where everyone can walk/bike/bus (and yes, even drive on occasion for specific purposes) to their daily needs. The laws of physics tell us it will *always* require less energy to move a 200lb person 2 miles rather than 4,200lbs (4,000lb car + 200lb person) 15 miles. *That* is first principles thinking. Stop thinking about how to efficiently move lots of people long distances using individual transport, start thinking about how to get people to their daily needs, since that's what we really care about.\n\nIt's literally as stupid as asking \"How do I efficiently boil 10 gallons of water in order to make a cup of tea?\" Um, stop using a 10-gallon water boiler and switch to a small electric tea kettle. \"But the tea kettle is 10% less efficient on a per-gallon basis!!!\" Yes, even if that's true you're still trying to boil 10 gallons of water just to make a single cup of tea, dumb ass! A slightly less efficient tea kettle that can boil 12 ounces of water will *always* require less energy.\n\nAgain, I don't think these things are very difficult to think through but I've never heard it tied directly to Elon's first principles thinking paradigm.",

The study of course, was not about individual choices, saying \"Here we argue that a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches provides a robust base for the review of the mitigation potentials of consumption options.\"\n\nIn question 3 on the BBC, they ask \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" However, the study found that the \"best transport choice\" is neither of these. The study found, \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options\" (their emphasis).\n\nSo, I am typing an email to the BBC's corrections department, to change question 3 to accurately represent the study to say that living car-free is the best transportation option.\n\nIn case they decide to re-word the question to ask \"Which is the better transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" I am also arguing that the study does a poor job of accounting for the real-world factors of Tesla vs. bus, namely:\n\n1. it does not account for CO2 emissions from construction of the vehicle.\n2. it does not ask where the electric car gets its electricity from.\n3. it does not make a traffic analysis; use of mass transit makes fossil-fuel cars less polluting by reducing traffic\n4. it assumes only short urban trips can be replaced with mass transit; the study found that public transit has CO2 emissions as low as 0.00-0.09 kg/km depending on the fuel source, since public transit is sometimes electrified anyway. Looking only at the exhaust pipe (which our study does), mass transit and electric cars are almost identical.\n\n.\n\nI provide my letter below and invite everyone to restate it in your own words asking that Question #3 be corrected to \"living car-free.\" The part about comparing electric vs mass is optional.\n\n.\n\nTo: [newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk](mailto:newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk) \\[newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk\\]\n\nBBC,\n\nI recently saw your quiz ([https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348)) on how individuals can make personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint.

Question 3 asks \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate?\" The study found that \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options,\"  (emphasis theirs). However, your quiz only lists \"electric car\" and  \"public transport\" as options for \"the best transport choice.\" The  correct answer in your quiz, according to the study, should be \"Living  car-free.\"\n\nBut  even if we wanted to compare electric cars to mass transit and ask the  better choice, there are four important aspects of the study to  consider.\n\n1. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe. Obviously electric is  zero, but mass transit varied between 0.00 kg/km (for electric buses  and trains) to 0.09 kg/km. Compare that to fossil fuel cars, which the  study found to have emissions between 0.6 and 3.6 depending on the  model, and electric and mass transit are almost identical. The study  assumed that mass transit would only replace \"short and urban car  trips,\" meaning the other trips were calculated as being done with a  fossil-fuel car. It's not a fair comparison.\n2. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the electric power plant it charges from. [This study](http://idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/Tesla_Motors.pdf) found that Tesla electric cars still generated 0.0461 kg/km when the grid is based on natural gas.\n3. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the CO2 released from production of the vehicle. [This Politifact article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/11/viral-image/producing-electric-cars-battery-does-not-emit-same/)  notes that just producing one electric car's battery can generate  between 4,500 and 7,500 kg of CO2, depending on the electricity source  of the factory. While buses also emit CO2 just by being built, this  value should be divided by its average ridership, which unfortunately  the Leeds study does not touch on.\n4. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering a traffic analysis. If more people take mass transit, there is less  traffic on the road, meaning the fossil-fuel-burning cars become more  fuel efficient. If they are replaced with electric cars, there is no reduction in traffic.\n\nThe  study is very helpful for a lot of reasons, but question number 3  should not be a comparison between electric cars and mass transit. It  should simply state that the \"best transport choice\" is living car-free,  as the study reports.\n\nBest regards,\n\n***\\[your IRL name\\]***\n\n***\\[your IRL email address\\]***",

There's often been a claim that eBike fires were due to \"cheap Chinese batteries\" but now it seems that China is implementing it's own safety standard on eBike batteries to break away from that.\n\nBefore you get too excited about the idea of getting safer eBike batteries there's a few caveats. For one, the regulation doesn't take effect till November 1st of this year. Plus it only covers domestic sales, no word yet on if it'll effect exported batteries to western countries. \n\nOf course if you live in China and have been putting off the idea of getting an ebike because of the (rare) chance of battery fires, this should give you peace of mind.",

      "title": "Why drive a Tesla when a WWII-era steam train can outdo it in emissions?",
      "text": "***WARNING: MATH AHEAD***\n\nSo recently, I watched an episode of the amazing podcast Well There\u0019s Your Problem, specifically episode 113 discussing battery-electric locomotives [1]. Around the 56 minute mark, host Justin Roczniak remarks that he and Tom Coletti did some \u001cback of the napkin math\u001d to determine the relative environmental impact of transporting passengers on a steam-locomotive powered train versus electric automobiles, and came to a pretty shocking conclusion about the break-even point. After seeing this, I was inspired to do the math myself and see if I could replicate his conclusions, here\u0019s what I found.\n\nWe\u0019ll start with the steam locomotive in question: for my math, I used Union Pacific FEF-3 locomotive number 844. This locomotive was built in 1944, and was frequently employed on passenger trains up until around 1957. Soon afterwards, it became one of the last surviving mainline steam locomotives still in use and was used from then onwards as a PR ambassador for the Union Pacific. This locomotive represents the state-of-the-art for steam locomotive design as it was when the art ended following WWII. \n\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the UP, the 844 has a fuel capacity of 6,200 gallons of No. 5 fuel oil, and one full tank will give the locomotive a range of approx. 300 miles [2]. This means that the engine burns around 21 gallons per mile. According to Climatiq, No. 5 fuel oil emits 10.24 kilograms of CO2e per gallon burned [3]. \n\n21gal per mile * 10.24kg CO2e per gal = 215.04kg of CO2e per mile\n\nTo make the math later on a little easier, I\u0019ll convert 215.04 kilograms to 215,040 grams.\n\nNext, let\u0019s take a look at the emissions from electric vehicles. Remember, although these vehicles do not directly pollute, the electric grid that these vehicles often get their charge from does. For my math, I decided to use the Tesla Model Y, simply for the fact that it is the best selling electric vehicle in the US. According to a study published to Statista, a Model 3 charged off of the US grid will emit 116 grams of CO2e per mile [4]. \n\nNow for the fun part. We\u0019ve established an apples-to-apples comparison for emissions from the 844 and the Model Y, so now we can simply divide and find the quotient:\n\n215040g / 116g H 1853.79\n\nSo it takes about 1854 Teslas to equal one 844 in terms of CO2e per mile. Assuming one person in each of those Teslas, how many passenger cars will the 844 need to pull in order to carry 1854 passengers? Let\u0019s give 844 the best shot possible by having it pull St Louis Car Company Bi-Level Commuter Coaches. These cars have a pretty high capacity of 169 seats per car, and when loaded have a weight of around 79 tons (62 tons for the empty car, plus 17 from the 169 200-pound passengers aboard) [5]. \n\n1854 / 169 H 10.97\n\nSo, with 11 passenger cars behind it, the 844 has broken even and produces less CO2e per mile than a fleet of Teslas. In the podcast, Justin says his math came out to about 10 cars, so we can say that his math is about right. Now for the even more important question, how fast can the 844 go with those 11 cars? Well, at 72 tons per car, this train would weigh 792 tons total. To find speed per train weight, I will refer to a set of charts used by the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 30s-early 40s to calculate tonnage ratings. On page 22, we see a chart for the FEF-1 class locomotives, which are similar enough to the FEF-3s to be comparable. At 792 tons, this train could reach nearly 100 MPH on flat track; just shy of 70 MPH on a 0.5% uphill grade; and just over 50 MPH on a 1% grade [6].\n\nTLDR:\n\nWhen pulling 11 bi-level commuter coaches, a 1944 steam locomotive produces less emissions per mile than if all the passengers in those coaches were to drive individual Teslas. Not only that, but this train could pull those coaches on flat track at a much higher speed than those Teslas could legally drive on our highways today, and at speeds similar to highways even when climbing hills. Keep all of this in mind whenever people try to tell you that electric vehicles are the way out of our current climate crisis. They aren\u0019t. Trains are.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0qcxyyllQ4\n[2]: https://www.up.com/heritage/steam/844/\n[3]: https://www.climatiq.io/data/emission-factor/d0440c0d-4ffc-4838-9079-43df928f54f3\n[4]: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401887/tesla-lifecycle-emissions-model-3-model-y-by-selected-countries-and-regions/#:~:text=While%20the%20emissions%20from%20a,Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.%2C%20respectively.\n[5]: https://www.irm.org/player/cnw1/?roster_type=custom\n[6]: https://utahrails.net/flebbe-papers/UP_Horsepower-Curves-and-Tonnage-Ratings-Charts.pdf\n",

One online ABC article about the issue was originally posted with the false statement that \"Hundreds of e-scooters and e-bikes are catching fire in Australian homes...\" That wildly inaccurate bit of information has since been removed, but not before a [Google crawler indexed it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hundreds+of+e-scooters+and+e-bikes+are+catching+fire+in+Australian+homes)\n\nDespite media reports to the contrary, e-scooters and e-bikes are not bursting into flames at an alarming rate. Over 5.5 years to mid 2022, there were less than 100 lithium-ion battery fires in Australia reported to the ACCC; remember, a dozen or more lithium-ion battery containing products can be found in the average Australian home today, including in laptops, tablets, children's toys, drills, etc. [Only 9 (yes nine) of those fires were caused by batteries inside e-mobility devices.](https://consultation.accc.gov.au/accc/lithium-ion-batteries-issues-paper/supporting_documents/ACCC%20Lithiumion%20Batteries%20Issues%20Paper.pdf) Nine e-scooter and e-bike fires over 5.5 years, compared to 10's of thousands of car fires over the same period (speculative based on [&gt;9,000 car fires in NSW alone in just a 36-month period](https://www.fireextinguisheronline.com.au/blog/post/electric-vehicle-fire-extinguisher-australia)).\n\nSo why the media frenzy on these devices being a risk? Vehicle manufacturers and energy companies have been manipulating the media and controlling the narrative around transport options for 100 years now ([reference 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOttvpjJvAo), [reference 2](https://www.drilledpodcast.com/)), they are world renowned experts at [manufacturing consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU).\n\nIn urban areas, a substantial amount of the distance we drive is for short trips, easily achievable by e-mobility devices. In Sydney, [50% of all vehicle km driven are for trips less than 5km](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/HTS%20Report%20Sydney%202012-13.pdf). If we are allowed to view new e-mobility options as the cheap, convenient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, spatially sustainable, and relatively safe products that they are, then we'll stop driving cars as much as we do. In turn, we'd also start demanding governments do more to make our streets safer for those who aren't driving cars... which in turn will cause more people take up alternative transport options.\n\nLeft unchecked, e-mobility devices have the potential to significantly reduce the amount we drive cars in our cities; this will hurt the bottom line of amongst the richest and most powerful businesses in the world. Something they will not allow to happen without a fight. Their decades old signature move? Narrative control and media manipulation.\n\nTL:DR; E-scooters and e-bikes are not catching fire at the rate the media is portraying, not even remotely. It is likely the usual powers are at work to ensure the general public are terrified of any transport option that is not a privately owned car.",

      "text": "So I live on a country road where it is 35mph or less all the way to town. Before EUCs I road an ebike which pissed off the car-brains according to Nextdoor. So, I upgraded to a 30+ mph Inmotion V11 EUC. Despite about a 10mph increase in my cruising speed I was still scolded and criticized by the car-brains for going a few mph slower than the posted speed limit and for being on the road. So, I upgraded again to a 40mph Nikola AR+ EUC and wouldn't you know it still annoys the car-brain's and results in various criticisms, road rage and more. I have witnessed countless cars speed pass me in turns on double yellows sometimes forcing oncoming traffic to slowdown and/or go off the road to allow them by. It amazes me the risks the car-brain's will take to save merely seconds worth of time, not to mention the laws they intentionally break so they can get to the redlight or stop sign first. Some of the car-brain's claim I don't pay taxes and shouldn't be able to use the road, but my batteries are heavily taxed, and I am legally allowed on the road so idk. Some of the car-brain's on Nextdoor said I shouldn't live out here if I am not going to drive a car, but I live where I live as I can't afford to live anywhere else. I can't wait to get a 45+/50 mph EUC and probably hear them cry in outrage at how I am now going too fast for the road that they regularly speed on with their cars. Probably the same dip$hits that speed past me only to get in front of me and slow down for a turn they otherwise could have waited patiently behind me to make which would have cost them little to no extra time, all while they create a dangerous traffic situation due to their feeling of needing to be in front.

      "text": "I live in the Netherlands but maybe my question applies worldwide. Though I'm too unaware of traffic laws in other countries to say anything about it. But here, Netherlands:\n\nExmple:\n\n1. There is a 50 km/hr road and bike path next to eachother. The bike path is full of fat tree roots and holes, which could damage my bike and could also cause me to fall if I don't pay attention for even one second. It would be safer for me to use the perfectly smooth road next to it, but no thats illegal, I have to use the bike path because the traffic sign says so.\n2. You have a 45 km/hr ebike. Your battery is empty so you ride at legpower, 15 km/hr. But are you allowed to use the bike path? No, the category of your vehicle makes you \"fast traffic\" regardless of the speed you ride with, so you have to use the road where cars fly past with 50+. How stupid is that!\n3. Fast mopeds legally have to use the 50km/hr road, but they are not allowed to actually drive 50. They are max allowed 45. You can imagine how much danger and frustration that causes when cars are behind. Seriously, why that weird number 45 and not 50?\n4. 25 km/hr ebikes you don't need a helmet or anything at all. 25 km/hr moped you need a helmet and insurance and drivers license. Why does this difference exist...\n5. If you race downhill, or get tailwind and go 40 km/h, thats perfectly fine. No need for a helmet, no need for insurance, no need for drivers license. But have an ebike assist more than 25 kmhr? You need these 3 things. Why would assisted 30 km/hr be more dangerous than unassisted 40?\n\nSome laws are dangerous to obey, (see 1 and 2 and 3), some laws are just weird (see 3 and 4 and 5)\n\nAlot of traffic laws don't make any sense at all, some of them look like someone who has never participated in traffic themselves made them up randomly.\n\nI just wonder why. Who comes up with those silly stupid laws / signs and why? Why are there so many restricting laws instead of giving people the freedom to determine what is the safest way for them to participate in traffic? I often find myself doing dangerous things as a result of obeying dangerous traffic laws because I do not want to get fined. These stupid laws achieve the exact opposite of what they were intended for.\n\nThere is already a law that basically says \"creating danger or hinder in traffic is illegal\" (Which contradicts the laws mentioned in 1 and 2 and 3 by the way), and that law alone should cover everything and be enough. If people obeyed that law, traffic would be nice. If people don't obey that law, they aren't going to obey other laws anyways. So I don't see the point of all these laws that are already covered by another law anyways. So why?",

Driving is fine, get home and have some seafood after being picked up by family. Altogether a good evening.\n\nThen the next fucking day I get in a crash on a route I\u0019ve taken thousands of times, on the same section of road my dad got rear-ended on with me and my little sister in the car.

      "text": "If you dont know what technicals are, they are basically a Toyota Hilux single cab pick up truck with a DSHK HMG bolted on a swiveling pintle to the truck bed. Ever since the Toyota war between Chad and Libya more or less pioneered the technical, every conflict ever since including Ukraine and Myanmar has been using the \"light\" (in military terms, but very heavy in civilian terms) vehicles and light weaponry as a very effective low cost tactic of fighting asymmetrical warfare.\n\nEven lighter vehicles have been employed in combat roles, WW2 had motorcycles with sidecar mounted machine guns, today's insurgencies commonly use motorcycle technicals with rpk's mounted on them. I thought based on that, why couldn't we do the same with bicycles and ebikes?\n\nBicycle mounted infantry had been a relatively common tactic from 1890-1910, the Nazis confiscated bicycles from occupied territories to serve as transport vehicles for their armed forces, and in the modern age with cargo ebikes being able to carry an adult passenger and a total mass of 250+ kg, I don't see why something like the [Propel Urban Arrow](https://propelbikes.com/product/urban-arrow-family-cargo/) or any analog or electric bakfiet couldn't have a pintle mounted machine gun in the front cargo basket or otherwise be used as a patrol / logistics vehicle, especially in places where full sized automobiles and trucks are too big to fit or otherwise are inadvisable.\n\nWhile I am aware the Ukrainian ebikes seen in [this article](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html) are more like Surrons and e motorcycles, the same concepts of micromobility in combat still apply to lighter ebikes imo. They dont use gasoline, they are quiet and far less detectable via sound and thermal signature, the fact that they are smaller than cars means they are smaller targets and take up less space, they can be recharged by the electrical grid assuming its still running in the area of operations, and even with dead batteries, they carry more cargo at a faster speed than personnel on foot.\n\nThis is definitely an idea i would say most of the pro 2nd crowd in the USA is completely overlooking in their blind support for rolling coal and lifted trucks.",

Nobody can dictate how your house/garden has to look like (except zoning laws, of course) and additionally new developments aren't carried out by large corporations so there are no neighbourhoods made completely out of similar looking houses.\n\n\n\n2) infrastructure\n\nThere is regular bus service from 5:30 to 23:30 on weekdays and from 00:00 to 3:30 / 5:30 to 00:00 on weekends.\n\n-&gt; Connections to the rest of the country are very good, meaning I can get away 80 km from home in an hour just by public transit.\n\n*I do need to add though that transit is way to expensive here which is one major drawback\n\nFurthermore, residential streets are narrow and don't allow more than 30km/h. The main road has two lanes, one for each direction and is capped at 50km/h. So you can comfortably cycle through the town in in residential streets (or one the main road, even though it's less pleasant) and walk on the continuous sidewalk. These things allow people to live without a car, reduce sprawling as less land is zoned for roads or parking.\n\n\n\n3) small businesses\n\nSmaller services such as hairdressers don't require a large customer base and are thus ideal for serving your village or maybe additionally your neighbour village. It's completely possible to run a business in your home or use part of your property for business.\n\n \n\n4) financing\n\nThere is no large town here that could support the suburbs. Thus single-family developments have to be paid for and aren't carried by subsidies. This isn't that tragic though as most middle class citizens can afford multi- or single family homes - their cost is reduced by not being dependent on a car and not being far away from everything else.\n\nIf you can't afford that you can still rent an apartment!\n\n\n\nSo, according to some people this place here should be an overdense shithole? Not at all, it's peaceful, spacious and there are a lot of green spaces.\n\nAll in all, I like how we do things here. Reducing car dependency leads to more flexibility in life, more prosperity and more communal, liveable places and I hope this way of building towns becomes commonplace everywhere.",

Basically they were saying stuff like people who drive electric cars should only be able to power them with solar and wind, if you are giving up fossil fuels you have to 100% give them up.  Overall making fun on anyone who cares about the environment because we all use and consume stuff and so aren't we just laughable hypocrites.\n\nI said i actually don't think electric cars will solve our environmental problems or help us develop more sustainable cities.  I said i don't feel people that own them are inherently better, some people buy them for status symbols, I know they take up energy and batteries have mined lithium.  I said better planning of cities and development where less people have to use cars and getting less cars on the road is a more important goal.  It could even make it better for those who want to drive and emergency vehicles if there is less traffic.\n\nStill I get most people currently in the US have to deal with a reality where you have to drive.  I'm not the one judging someone for having a car, electric or not, i don't know their situation.  And the state of our electric grid is not an individual person's fault even if we can make the choice to use less energy.  I overheat easy and I live in Florida, I'm using AC.  I like that options for different kind of vehicles exist, we need to look at all options even if i don't think it is THE solution and that ultimately we need less cars.  And that i don't like the idea that if you can't be perfect it is not worth doing something at all. \n\nBoth of my comments got a laugh react from them.  \n\nI can't explain how much it hurts to try so hard to be reasonable and understanding and get laugh reacts.  People can be assholes and carbrain society is just one thing making it worse.  But it really hurts and i don't think any people anywhere else will care about my feelings from this exchange.",

      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

Since 1990, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the weight of the average pickup has increased by twelve hundred and fifty-six pounds\u0014thirty-two per cent. A recent post on Vice observed that the largest pickups and S.U.V.s today are as big as Second World War-era tanks. Now pickups are going to get heavier still. The Lightning, because of its lithium-ion battery, weighs approximately sixty-five hundred pounds; in some cases the pickup can be more than two thousand pounds heavier than its gas counterpart. You\u0019ll be capable of assaulting a mountaintop redoubt, even if you\u0019re just driving to the store for milk.\n\nNot only are large E.V.s not as green as smaller E.V.s.; what about all the people who aren\u0019t in big vehicles? Analysis from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has shown that pedestrians who are hit by pickups or S.U.V.s are two to three times more likely to die than those who are hit by cars. In fact, the number of pedestrians killed by vehicles rose forty-six per cent between 2010 and 2019. According to the Governors Highway Safety Association, if you count deaths against vehicle miles travelled, 2020 saw the largest increase in pedestrian fatalities (twenty-one per cent) since nationwide tracking started, in 1975. Even though fewer vehicles were on the road early in the pandemic, more people died.\"\n\nIn my opinion electrifying is not the solution.\n\nLet's have a meaningful discussion about this.",

I now have a light rail station connected by a BICYCLE bridge over  the EVIL I-5 right next to my house. I\u0019ll still need my bike for the last mile and a half after I get off the train, but I can do that in my sleep. I spent a few hours looking at different routes on Google Maps last night and there\u0019s a grocery store directly on my way home. This is the European commute I have always dreamed of!!!!!\n\nPlus, I can visit my mother anytime I want by taking the light rail all the way from Northgate to Angle Lake in under an hour.

But looking at the numbers, I think it has more problems than benefits, the cars have high leasing, maintainance and fuel expenses, managers use them more for personal use than work related issues, and with remote conferences on site visits are not as often as they used to be.\nI think we could manage better having just a couple of \"service cars\" to be used as needed and using Uber/Taxi or renting at Hertz if necessary. I mean I would love to give them ebikes, but with the current car culture that would be problematic.\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "title": "I cannot find any legitimate \"use\" for a pickup truck. For most \"utility\" tasks that pickup trucks are marketed for, a cargo van can do just as well if not better.",
      "text": "For real, I cannot find any legitimate use for pickup trucks that would justify their existence. A cargo van is better suited for most tasks that pickup trucks are marketed for. And don't get me started on the possibilities with a Bakfiet cargo bike.\n\nThe main inspiration for creating this post was that a few months ago, to clear up some junk in my grandma's garage (most of the junk is from my uncle who dumps it in her garage, family issues. Also he's pretty carbrained as well) we opted to rent a utility vehicle. There was a small discussion on whether we should rent a U-haul pickup truck or a U-haul cargo van. I said \"Go for the van\" and we did. Thank goodness we didn't make the wrong choice (this event happened before I got interested in urban planning and the negative effects of car dependency) because if we had chosen the pickup truck, it would have been a disaster. Needless to say, we got the van, loaded the junk in the back, and dropped it off at the dump. If we'd chosen the pickup truck, not only could we have not loaded it with as much junk as the pickup truck had an open truck bed, but everything would have flown out from the back causing a disaster. (Please forgive us for being ignorant, only recently did we find out just how impractical modern pickup trucks are).\n\nThis got me thinking. With all of the tasks that pickup trucks are marketed as being capable of, hauling cargo, utility vehicles, and vehicles for trades like plumbing, HVAC, etc. I would argue that a cargo van is just as capable if not better suited for these jobs and tasks than pickup trucks. Meaning that there's literally no reason for pickup trucks to exist, and if I had my way, (I don't care if I get called authoritarian, I have the right NOT to get run over by an oversized pickup truck. You do not have the right to endanger everyone else because of your fragile ego and small <F) the production of pickup trucks should be discontinued.\n\nUsing a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter as the basis for the cargo van, let's go down the list of potential \"uses\" for a pickup truck and see if the van is better suited.\n\n[https://www.mercedes-benz-vans.ca/en/sprinter/cargo-van?ds\\_rl=1254851&amp;gad\\_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7oeqBhBwEiwALyHLMzAH6RhysWIL01gv9YZcvjwI-65lREi1A4vfe9C4in9JwjU\\_X34aLBoC5YkQAvD\\_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.mercedes-benz-vans.ca/en/sprinter/cargo-van?ds_rl=1254851&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7oeqBhBwEiwALyHLMzAH6RhysWIL01gv9YZcvjwI-65lREi1A4vfe9C4in9JwjU_X34aLBoC5YkQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\n[https://www.mbvans.com/en/sprinter/cargo-van](https://www.mbvans.com/en/sprinter/cargo-van)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8wn4xbh1p3d1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23e39c6cbcb3ec3fcfee5acf2767b89520086017\n\nCargo:\n\nWhile pickup trucks can carry stuff in the truck bed, the ironic thing is that the truck bed of modern pickup trucks is so small that nearly everything in the back sticks out, posing a risk for everyone else. A cargo van can not only fit cargo lengthwise but can also stack cargo up to the roof not to mention that it can fully enclose cargo, protecting it from the elements. When my family rented the cargo van, we stacked the junk all the way to the top. We were surprised by how much stuff we could fit in the back and side note, with our personal 2019 Honda Odyssey Minivan, we manage to fit and entire door inside of it. Try finding a modern pickup truck that can fit a door in the truck bed without it sticking out.\n\nWhen it comes to transporting large amount of cargo securely, sorry pickups but trucks but this point goes to the van.\n\nVan: 1\n\nPickup Truck: 0\n\nVersatility:\n\nWhile a standard stock cargo van is suitable for most tasks, the nice thing about the Sprinter is that it can be customized to have more passengers seats, turning it into a pseudo shuttle bus. While I'm not sure about the specifics, I can theorize that the Sprinters can have removable seats, allowing the user to add/remove seats when needed. As for pickup trucks, the \"crew cab\" variants sacrifice cargo space for passengers, making it impractical as crew cab pickup trucks are neither good for passenger capacity or cargo. It tries to do both but fails, whereas the cargo van can do both tasks/swap between the two (cargo and passengers) with ease.\n\nVan: 2\n\nPickup Truck: 0 \n\nPedestrain Safety:\n\nWhile neither vehicle has the best visibility or a low hood design, the Sprinter cargo van is slightly better as it's hood is short and angled downwards allowing for better visibility and is less dangerous for pedestrians. Also, random everyday \"civilians\" aren't driving around Sprinter vans all the time as the trades, delivery companies, etc. are the ones chartering out these vans. As for pickup trucks and their hood design, do I even has to explain it? They're literally killing us!\n\n[https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-safety/the-hidden-danger-of-big-pickup-trucks-a9662450602/](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-safety/the-hidden-danger-of-big-pickup-trucks-a9662450602/)\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/americas-cars-trucks-are-getting-bigger-are-front-blind-zones-children-rcna52109](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/americas-cars-trucks-are-getting-bigger-are-front-blind-zones-children-rcna52109)\n\nVan: 3\n\nPickup Truck: 0\n\nPracticallity:\n\nGoing to a different story. So, my dad's sedan was damaged and was in the shop for repairs. So we were given a F-150 pickup truck as a courtesy vehicle. And with first-hand experience, I can safely say that pickup truck are the most impractical vehicle for everyday use. Firstly, it had an open truck bed, meaning that when couldn't put luggage or groceries in the back. Sure, some truck have a cover or canopy, but those are add-ons for the elephant in the room. Second, it's so tall and hard the climb into. When we decided to use it for some furniture, I had trouble loading it in the truck bed due to it's height. And finally, it was a gas guzzler. My dad spent so much money one fuel which is in sharp contrast to the turbo charged Mercedes-Benz C Class that he drives that is rather rule efficient. As for the cargo van, well when we loaded the U-haul van, it was very practical and didn't cause us any trouble. Do I need to explain myself further?\n\nVan: 4\n\nPickup Truck: 0\n\nNow, the only category that pickup trucks might have an edge is which towing but A. vehicles made for towing should be designed without a boxy, pedestrian-killing hood, and B. who the hell can afford a motor home and a yacht?\n\nVan: 4\n\nPickup Truck: 1\n\nAnd finally, to address the \"open truck bed\" for transporting loose gravel. Not only are the beds for modern pickup trucks short, but there's literally a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter with a flat open bed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2ez5wv47p3d1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f93e52a4d123a4ed9e50b1597c574d52b96278c5\n\nNot to mention that a small trailer would be better for gravel as many of them can dump the load like a dump truck.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ja43lpli7p3d1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74d05948df76865aa806ac425ae494a84ab69a9b\n\nFinal verdict\n\nCargo Van: 5\n\nPickup Truck: 1\n\nApart from towing which lets be honest, most pickup truck drivers never towed anything in their lives, a cargo van is better for most if not all utility tasks. They're versatile with large cargo and passenger capacity, safer for pedestrians, and are just more practical for day to day tasks. For \"tasks\" that pickup trucks are marketed for, a flatbed variant of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is more that capable of performing that, or a small Home Depot rental trailer as most cargo vans have some towing capacities.\n\nSo in conclusion, I cannot find any reason that justifies the existence of modern, North American pickup trucks as cargo vans are better in almost every single way. The sole reason for the existence of modern oversized pickup trucks is that they are marketed towards the worse people ever, pickup truck drivers with anti-social, reactionary politics. \n\nIf I had my way, I would end the production of pickup trucks or at the very least end the sale of them to civilians as personal vehicles used for non-work purposes (I mean you can say that for all personal automobiles, but lets start with the worse of the worse) as they have no reason for existing apart from people with a fragile ego and toxic personality. While it's a chicken and egg question regarding pickup truck drivers, I can safely say that by eliminating pickup trucks, we can help to mitigate the toxic personalities they embolden.",

      "text": "I'm an automotive tech by trade, before that I was a auto body tech, and before that I worked in an auto parts store. I also do some specialty aftermarket work. Its pretty anti- my own damn profession to be anti car, but some of the things I have seen makes me insanely paranoid on the road. I just want to share some of the things I have seen in my 8 year career.\n\nWhen I worked in auto parts:\n\n-People working on cars who obviously had no buisness working on them.\n\n-Buying parts is a game in itself. Some manufacturers just have no quality control. Its ok if its a coil or fuel pump, a danger when its a ball joint. I will only buy moog ball joints.\n\nWhen I did body work:\n\n-Once worked on a customer pay car. Bumper reinforcement was caved in, they only wanted the cover replaced. Absolute hazard to anyone on the road. Left it disassembled in one of my bays for a week insisting the owner makes them pay for one, even offering to pull one from a junkyard and do the labor for free.\n\n-Sketch \"techs\" with no regard for safety. Budget non-certified shops do it. Vehicles leave being more of a hazard than before the wreck\n\n-Cars coming in with only undercarriage damage. Typically \"ran off the road\" (code for distracted driving) or driving too fast for conditions.\n\nIn my past and current mechanical jobs:\n\n-2 seperate occasions have had failed brake lines. Both declined repairs. \"They're buddy can do it cheaper\" is code for they're gonna limp it home and have their buddy Bubba come put compression fittings on. They are not automotive grade and anyone who uses these should not be allowed to pick up a single tool again.\n\n-Disgusting cars. These have an impact on driving habits and no one acknowledges it. If you have stuff shifting in the back you're going to take wider turns and focus more on the stuff in the back than on the road. I've also seen smokers cars that have tar covering the windshield to the point of causing visibility issues. Fucking disgusting.\n\n-Anything that doesn't keep the car running is neglected. Bald tires, bad brakes, neglected brake fluid, compromised brake boosters, tail lights and head lights out, it all poses a danger to everyone but people are ok with neglecting them if they can continue driving. Its only once the car doesn't drive is when people care, not when they drive unsafe. I will say, bald tires is one that transcends economic classes. I've seen people with Hyundais replace tires as soon as they're in the yellow, and I've seen new Mercedes drive off with bald tires and fucked alignment\n\nIn my aftermarket experience (really me just doing more fun shit off the clock) I deal with a lot less.\n\nI have had to tell people If I fuck with their suspension I'm raising it since their dumbass is bouncing all over the road with zero suspension travel. I've told people to stop being stupid and put an exhaust on their car. I've not touched cars until safety issues are fixed. I absolutely refuse to do any lifted cars. I'll lower cars (and drive a lowered car myself) as long as its not too crazy, ball joints, bushings, and tie rods are in good condition, no excessive camber, and I align it after. If I do aftermarket headlights, they aren't going to be excessively bright, and they'll be adjusted. Not a big fan of non oem headlights/ taillights but some cars, finding oem lights are hard if not impossible.\n\nI also don't work on anything joker themed. Its more common than you all would think. I just think its tacky.\n\nThats a long rant though. Be safe out there because chances are that the motorists around you got in their car thats already unsafe. Then they ear their breakfast and talk on their phones driving it.",

      "title": "Sending a letter to the BBC about their recent quiz",
      "text": "A day or so ago, the BBC posted a [quiz](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348) about how we as individuals can minimize our CO2 emissions based on a [meta-analysis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/pdf) of 6,992 studies. The study of course, was not about individual choices, saying \"Here we argue that a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches provides a robust base for the review of the mitigation potentials of consumption options.\"\n\nIn question 3 on the BBC, they ask \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" However, the study found that the \"best transport choice\" is neither of these. The study found, \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options\" (their emphasis).\n\nSo, I am typing an email to the BBC's corrections department, to change question 3 to accurately represent the study to say that living car-free is the best transportation option.\n\nIn case they decide to re-word the question to ask \"Which is the better transport choice for the climate: buying an electric car or using public transport as much as possible?\" I am also arguing that the study does a poor job of accounting for the real-world factors of Tesla vs. bus, namely:\n\n1. it does not account for CO2 emissions from construction of the vehicle.\n2. it does not ask where the electric car gets its electricity from.\n3. it does not make a traffic analysis; use of mass transit makes fossil-fuel cars less polluting by reducing traffic\n4. it assumes only short urban trips can be replaced with mass transit; the study found that public transit has CO2 emissions as low as 0.00-0.09 kg/km depending on the fuel source, since public transit is sometimes electrified anyway. Looking only at the exhaust pipe (which our study does), mass transit and electric cars are almost identical.\n\n.\n\nI provide my letter below and invite everyone to restate it in your own words asking that Question #3 be corrected to \"living car-free.\" The part about comparing electric vs mass is optional.\n\n.\n\nTo: [newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk](mailto:newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk) \\[newssiteerrors@bbc.co.uk\\]\n\nBBC,\n\nI recently saw your quiz ([https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58996348)) on how individuals can make personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint. Your quiz was based on [this University of Leeds study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8589/meta). Question 3 asks \"What\u0019s the best transport choice for the climate?\" The study found that \"*Living* *car-free* has the highest median mitigation potential across all of the reviewed options,\"  (emphasis theirs). However, your quiz only lists \"electric car\" and  \"public transport\" as options for \"the best transport choice.\" The  correct answer in your quiz, according to the study, should be \"Living  car-free.\"\n\nBut  even if we wanted to compare electric cars to mass transit and ask the  better choice, there are four important aspects of the study to  consider.\n\n1. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe. Obviously electric is  zero, but mass transit varied between 0.00 kg/km (for electric buses  and trains) to 0.09 kg/km. Compare that to fossil fuel cars, which the  study found to have emissions between 0.6 and 3.6 depending on the  model, and electric and mass transit are almost identical. The study  assumed that mass transit would only replace \"short and urban car  trips,\" meaning the other trips were calculated as being done with a  fossil-fuel car. It's not a fair comparison.\n2. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the electric power plant it charges from. [This study](http://idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/Tesla_Motors.pdf) found that Tesla electric cars still generated 0.0461 kg/km when the grid is based on natural gas.\n3. The study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering the CO2 released from production of the vehicle. [This Politifact article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/11/viral-image/producing-electric-cars-battery-does-not-emit-same/)  notes that just producing one electric car's battery can generate  between 4,500 and 7,500 kg of CO2, depending on the electricity source  of the factory. While buses also emit CO2 just by being built, this  value should be divided by its average ridership, which unfortunately  the Leeds study does not touch on.\n4. The  study only counted emissions at the exhaust pipe, not considering a traffic analysis. If more people take mass transit, there is less  traffic on the road, meaning the fossil-fuel-burning cars become more  fuel efficient. If they are replaced with electric cars, there is no reduction in traffic.\n\nThe  study is very helpful for a lot of reasons, but question number 3  should not be a comparison between electric cars and mass transit. It  should simply state that the \"best transport choice\" is living car-free,  as the study reports.\n\nBest regards,\n\n***\\[your IRL name\\]***\n\n***\\[your IRL email address\\]***",

While many functioning transit agencies do accomplish that goal, in an attempt to curve back car dependency and encourage transit use, many agencies employ Park and Rides.\n\nFor those who didn't know (though most people do), Park and Rides are where people park their cars (usually at a train station) and ride transit (usually a train).

Specifically, Park and Rides with cars as secure bicycle parking at train stations is always good and based.\n\nI'm relatively neutral regarding Park and Rides as while we should encourage people to minimize car use; if they are going to use cars, might as well have them use Park and Rides as it offers several benefits to drivers. \n\nSeveral benefits of Park and Rides include bypassing traffic and being faster than driving (if it's a train), parking costs as while parking in cities is expensive, parking at Park and Rides is cheap if not free, security as at least with more elaborate lots, they tend to be pretty secure, and overall savings by not driving their cars as much meaning that they won't have to spend as much on fuel, maintenance, and wear and tear. And by driving less, their car lasts longer with fewer mechanical issues. Side note, I've seen some pretty high-end sports cars like Mustangs and yes, even the dreaded modern pickup trucks at the Park and Ride at the commuter train station near where I'm staying.\n\nSmall rant here but while Park and Ride make sense for train stations; while visiting Washington State with my father, some agencies have Park and Rides in their bus loops. No offense to buses but for many people, why would they ride the bus if it gets stuck in the same traffic? At least with a train, they are grade-separated or at least get priority. However, I do see some cars parked at bus-only loops. Rant over.\n\nHowever I will say this, transit agencies should prioritize being able to transport passengers without people needing to drive for a portion of their journey as Park and Rides should be secondary to foot passenger service.\n\nI know that in Toronto, Canada, GO Transit and its commuter train service was originally created as a way to curve back cars flooding and congesting the city. As such, many stations were basically giant parking lots, and while the GO Train helped to transport people to the city; because it was originally intended as a Band-Aid to car traffic, many of the stations were difficult to access without a car. Thankfully, that's changed as some stations have amenities and development nearby and trains have more service in both directions but still, improvements can be made as many stations have massive parking lots.\n\nTo play devil's advocate for a second, if we *do* have car-free cities, and if (personal) cars are to still exist, we might need Park and Rides, especially for stations that are in less populated, rural, and suburban areas. However, if there are going to be Park-and-Ride-lots, please no surface parking, it's an eyesore, a waste of space, and inefficient compared to parking garages and multi-level underground parking.\n\nEither way, I'm open to hearing your opinions on Park and Rides and whether or not the transit agencies in your area employ them. Take care!",

      "text": "I live in the Czech republic, a country in Central Europe. We have the most dense rail network in the world. We also have excellent public transportation.\n\nI barely travel via car. But every time I do, I just hate it. Roads are congested, unsafe, crazy. I believe any Czech can vouch for just how crazy the D1 highway is. I've simply come to realize that cars are not the ideal transport mode.\n\nI love trains. Trains are f**ing amazing here. I get on a train from Prague, the capital, to Brno, the second largest city and can relax and read a book or even sleep in a very modern train (\fD Railjet). There is also a restaurant on said train which serves extremely delicious food. \n\nJust a few days ago, I was taking the aforementioned trip via train, after being forced to partake in the same trip via highway just the day prior, and went to the restaurant car to get some food. I was sitting there, watching the world go by, eating some of the most delicious *sví\rková* (regional dish) I've ever had. I also had draft beer which was fairly good and realized - why in the world would I choose to take the highway when I can have this level of comfort for a fraction of the price gas would consume?\n\nEdit: to get more into the price aspect - a train trip from Prague to Brno (cca 260km) costs me on average $8. Driving there would cost me at least $25 and that's me being fairly generous with the fuel consumption.",

      "text": "Today is a very important day for me. Twenty years ago, I left my car at home and took the bus to work. It was an experience, but I never went back to using a car for daily transportation. \n\nAfter a while, I sold it. In São Paulo in 2010 I rediscovered the bicycle. In Florianópolis in 2021 I've got a cargobike to carry my daughter around. \n\nIn twenty years, I aged ten.\n\nIn those twenty years:\n\n- Thousands of square meters were covered in asphalt and concrete for cars\n- Traffic only got worse\n- Cars are bigger and much more expensive\n- Fuel prices only went up\n- We still kill thousands of people each year on the roads and streets\n\nWhat will the next twenty years be like?\n\nWhat was once cycling activism has become class consciousness and an awareness of how the car is an instrument for keeping the working class chained to empty dreams, like the ackward image I saw of a Porsche stuck in traffic on a Monday morning.\n \nSo you have a Porsche in Brazil and still have to wake up early on Monday comrade?! \n\nGiving up the car changed who I met, how I interacted with people, and even altered my love life.\n\nMy wife first saw me as I entered an office on Avenida Paulista in 2010 carrying a folding bike. \n\nI told my daughter that she's only here because one day I decided to leave the car at home.\n\nFinancially, I'll always be an exploited proletarian, but I'm a little less so. I was 25 when I gave up the car and was always struggling financially.\n\nAfter that, I managed to save 10, 20, sometimes 50% of what I earned. I bought land, I paid for the house. I did the math: It was due to not having a car.\n\nToday, I'm celebrating with my wife in a nice place. We took an app car, we'll probably take a couple more today. It's something we do once in a while. It's expensive, the company sucks, but In the end, it doesn't come close to the cost of a simple car repair, not to mention everything else. \n\nWe don't pay the app car to ride in it, we pay for it to go away.\n\nWhat about driving experiences? You know what we see in car commercials? Well, I only buy those part of the experiences.\n\nFor example: in 2018, I drove a super 4x4 truck through Patagonia. Returning it to the small airport in Balmaceda at the end of the trip was just as enjoyable.\n\nIn 2008, I drove across east Canada in a rental car. I even had the chance to drive on the Gilles Villeneuve F1 circuit in Montreal. It was just for fun, not as a serious means of transportation.\n\nFor that, nothing so far beats the trains I took in Europe. \n\nI get the fetish, just don't let it affect my daily choices.",

I dont think so - I frequently encounter situations like, going up a steep hill and still overtaking mopeds while on my ebike, meaning that I have more climbing/accelerating power than these.

      "text": "Obviously, people have reasons, like time / convenience / /comfort /room for passegers\n\nSo wanting a car is completely understandable. But wait...\n\nWhen I look at how expensive it is to buy/own/rent/use a car.. everything gained from it seems not worth the cost, not even close. I understand that having a car has benefits, but they simply aren't big enough to justify all the money you have to lose for it.\n\nSo when I see someone who owns a car, I assume that either they are financially irresponsible, or rich, or in some weird situation that forces them to need a car, which is unlikely because here in the netherlands everything can be biked and also decent public transport.\n\nI have many reasons to not get a car, or even a drivers license, but money is the main reason for me. Getting a car would give me slight benefits at the cost of huge loads of money. Why would I do that? Why do people do that?\n\nHere you can get those 45 km/h electric moped/ebike. IN other words, 80 seconds per kilometer. For a car traveling 100 km/h that would be 36 seconds, so you save only 44 seconds per km. If you commute 20 times per month, 20km and 20km back then thats 20x40 = 800 km per month, 800x44 = 35200 seconds or about 10 hours of time saved, multiply 10 by the minimum wage of about 10 per hour you get ¬100 saved, at the cost of.. ¬300 monthly costs related to the car. Stupid. You pay about ¬300 per month in order to save ¬100 worth of commuting time. I guess the other ¬200 is for the comfort even though it doesnt rain every day.\n\nCar drivers are the opposite of lazy. They work super hard to be able to pay for fuel, tax, insurance, car maintenance, parking, fines, etc.. while I on my bike don't have to work hard because owning and using my ebike costs nothing.\n\nI just don't get it.

Always have to check the road. I'm too stressed to sleep when someone else is driving, so I just sit in the little metal box with no room for my legs. If more than 2 people are in the car, it's crowded and you don't want it to last very long.\n\nYou feel like an a$$hole driving through little villages where people and animals are outdoor, and houses are close to the road.\n\nSleeping in a car is not comfortable at all. You rapidly run out of fresh air.\n\nThere are potentially many spots and things you can visit pretty much everywhere, but it means that you are always hitting the road again, and always in a state of FOMO. Also, to be honest, a huge part of the trip is on highways and in the smell of gas, from one petrol station to the next. These places are horrible, when not spooky.\n\nThere's always this sense of losing fuel and money every mile. When you pay a train ticket (or ride a bike), it's done once, and go.\n\nIn short, I don't know what people appreciate in a road trip. It may be fun in very specific micro regions with the perfect balance between remoteness and comfort, but the route to get there is always exhausting. \n\nI'd rather take the train and then stay a few days in the same place.

Including their own offspring?\n\nI don\u0019t understand how an adult would think that it\u0019s okay to pollute in general but especially at the place that their kid(s) and others are at. Then of course there\u0019s the financial burden of idling their empty oversized tanks every day. I would figure that this alone would be enough to prevent them, given that caring about others and the environment doesn\u0019t seem to.\n\nI wouldn\u0019t be surprised to find that these very same motorists are amongst the ones who complain the loudest about the cost of fuel.",

      "title": "The concept of Jay walking being illegal is more dangerous to pedestrians than Jay walking itself.",
      "text": "This history of Jay walking is rooted in a publicity scandal orchestrated by the automotive industry to sell the idea that pedestrians that cross the street at any location other than a crosswalk and in any direction others than a right angle from the sidewalk are suicidal maniacs with no regard for public safety. \n\nThe principal of this publicity stunt was to force pedestrians off the roads (where they were allowed to walk freely at the time) and reduce the competition for road space for cars. (Unsurprisingly, this was also right around the time Ford and Firestone were buying up streetcar companies just to put them out of commission - another anticompetitive practice for claiming the road in the name of cars). \n\nThe unforeseen results (or maybe intended, who knows) of this scandal and outlawing of Jay walking, was a deontological self-righteousness in drivers that feel personally offended by Jay walkers since it is \u001cillegal\u001d. I can only image this also plays a major role in the car apologist mindset that is to blame for demanding reflective vests of anyone not in a Ford F-150. \n\nI think it\u0019s time Jay walking be made entirely legal at the federal level. Jay walking laws don\u0019t stop the majority of people from doing it. They don\u0019t generate revenue for the state the same way tolls or tickets do. So that means their primary purpose is to fuel a self-righteous rage in car drivers that feel like the road is their birthright. By legalizing Jay walking, car drivers would no longer have this defense. If a car driver hit a pedestrian, it would be entirely their fault (as it should be excluding some edge cases like insurance fraud). \n\nThere should still be crosswalks and guidelines to use them over Jay walking, but all intersections of commercially active streets should be considered unmarked crosswalks.\n\nFor highways, large arterial roads without commercial activity, and rural roads, this may not apply. But for all urban areas and even suburban ones (including 3-4 lane main arterial roads in densely packed commercially active neighborhood centers with good reason for pedestrian traffic) this should be the case.\n\nPlease feel free to give me feedback on this proposal. I\u0019d like to see where it may fall apart.\n\n[edit]: the idea of Jay walking being dangerous, and a lot of the anti-jaywalking comments i hear hinge of the assumption that a pedestrian jaywalking is doing so without thinking twice before stepping into the road. I\u0019d like to remind everyone that pedestrians are thorough aware of the dangers of the road and do the mental calculus necessary to judge how safe it is to cross the street. Its no more of a danger to pedestrians than crossing at a walk sign without looking while cars are allowed to do right on red (in this case a walk sign even provides a false sense of security and a car is still able to cross your path, even sneaking up behind you in some cases).",

      "text": "TL;DR - Your car is precisely how the government tracks you, and dictates where you go. And you are a LOT less private than you assume lol. Read item 3 for that one.\n\n\nI know Fox News, with an assist by the State of Texas, recently tried to make the anti-car movement a scary Leftist scheme to destroy your personal liberty, but there is no political stance which fuels r/FuckCars. I assume most people on this sub are Left-leaning, because 1) this is Reddit lol, and 2) most people here seem to live in urban areas. But the anti-car idea is not tribalistic in a political nature, even though everything appears to be these days...\n\n\nITEM 1: All roads in the US are carefully mapped by... *the government*. The roads dictate where you can go. The government creates the roads with tax dollars (which is outrageously more $$$ per capita than public transit and/or pedestrian/cyclist/skateboarder, etc. could EVER muster, btw). \n\nITEM 2: You have to register your car annually, which gives the government so much information about you. You pay for parking, tolls, etc, and all of this is constantly tracking you. The rates you pay is more government control over you, because you have no other option, and they set that rate.\n\nITEM 3: And, buckle up for this one....\n\nI recently worked for an auto insurance company in the claims department. There was a software program available to us (not even just the government - we were a private company, but still given access to this) that has photos of your car on the road, or even parked at your residence, identified by a license plate reading bot, taken without ANY driver's explicit permission. I believe something similar to those Google Map Streetview cars (or perhaps those cars exactly) are actually scanning the streets for these photos... *all the time.* They have photos of you in your car. I *very* rarely came across an instance that had zero hits. Even in very rural areas.\n\nThe software can then give out all the information about who the car is registered to, and what other people *may* be driving it (all family members, roommates, other people even just loosely linked to the insurance policy, etc.). Then the addresses of where all these people have ever lived *in their entire lives*. And, lastly, any phone number, email, or social media profile that *may* be linked to them, with a certainty percentage next to each one.... Oh, and a damn accurate family tree of everybody who has ever been connected with that car under it's current or past registration.\n\nWe would use this technology to see if people were lying about when and what damage occured on their car. If a photo from 4 months ago had severe front end damage, a policy started 6 weeks ago, then a claim for a front-end deer hit was made for event which they claimed happened 1 month ago... hmmm...\n\nSome people have NO idea how much their car obliterates any sense of privacy they ever had lol. It is quite literally how the government tracks you.",

      "text": "So, a couple of times I've visited Canada Place, the main cruise ship terminal for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (getting there by the SkyTrain, of course). While the phrase \"cities aren't loud, cars are!\" is very much applicable in all cities that allows cars into them, to push that point home, not sure if anyone has noticed that a fricken cruise ship is quieter than cars!\n\nI've seen several cruise ships depart from Canada Place in person, and one of the main things that I notice is just how quiet they are (to the people on the docks at least). The ships don't produce any loud engine noise, with the only sounds being at most the gentle churning of the water from the maneuvering thrusters. And unless the ship is reversing, the cruise ships don't even horn (if they're facing forward when departing). The loudest part of the dock are the forklifts used to load luggage... and cheesy early 2000s music the ship plays.\n\nNote how I can fall asleep near a cruise ship and not even notice that it's leaving. Try falling asleep near a busy highway. \n\nUp North in Horseshoe Bay is a BC Ferries terminal, but the ferries are quiet, no horning when departing, with the nosiest part being the cars unloading, because cars. But apart from that, these modern passenger ships are quiet (at least to us landlubbers on shore).\n\nPS: I know cruise ships are an environmental disaster and they should be limited and/or no longer use diesel fuel. And that they *do* produce noise pollution that mainly affects marine animals underwater due to noise from the propellers reverberating through the water, etc. But I'm just mentioning how compared to cars, cruise ships are quieter, at least on the surface.",

After that, sign [this petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/support-gap-funding-for-public-transportation)\n\n* The state budget is due in a couple of weeks, and the current draft will defund transit. If we don't stop this, public transportation in California could be set back generations, with some agencies lost entirely. Visit [https://www.savecaliforniatransit.org](https://www.savecaliforniatransit.org) for more info\n* Suggested talking points are included, but please tell your own personal story if you can\n* Asm. Ting only represents San Francisco, but all Californians should still call in. He's the budget chair, so he has disproportionate power and is the main person blocking transit funding. Be honest, if you're not a San Franciscan then state which assembly district you are from\n* After calling Ting's office, additionally try to call your own assemblymember, your state senator, and the governor's office! You may also use [this tool](https://sftransitriders.salsalabs.org/2023budget/index.html) to send an email, although calling is best if you can\n* San Francisco is the 2nd most transit-dependent city in the nation. Tell the assemblymember that if he kills BART, he'll be remembered as the man who killed San Francisco\n* Signing the petition will also add you to an email list so you can stay updated on the fight to save California's transit\n\n*That's all you really need to know, feel free to ignore the rest of this post. Additional context is available below for anyone who's interested*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPublic transit agencies in California are in a tough situation. By American standards, we have better-than-average transit (low bar!), and accordingly our transit systems have relatively high ticket revenues. Agencies grew dependent on these fares for their budget, and suffered greatly when Covid knocked out the reliable commuter market. Although ridership is recovering, the recovery is not fast enough to plug the budget holes.\n\nCurrently there is [a proposal](https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1650901636355883009), championed by Sen. Scott Weiner &amp; others, which would not only save our transit systems but also make them better than ever. $5B in operations funding, tied directly to accountability &amp; reform requirements. For the first time, this state could have adequate funding for transit, alongside meaningful oversight to ensure it is used correctly.\n\nHowever, many voices in the state government are opposing this funding, most notably [Asm. Ting](https://twitter.com/cyrusphall/status/1657144633531711489) and [Gov. Newsom](https://twitter.com/orkoliberal/status/1657216211447578624/photo/1). There is a budget deficit, but it seems disingenuous considering that Weiner's proposal is self-funding, and we're not even considering cutting any of the tens of billions in the highway budget.\n\nThis may be confusing, as you've probably heard of all the funding that's been allocated by the Biden administration, and all the new projects underway in California. However, these grants are generally only allowed to be used on capital projects, which is to say new infrastructure and vehicles. The funds that actually pay for operators and fuel are known as operating funds. These are traditionally covered by fares &amp; state-level funding, both of which are currently lacking. We're ironically headed for a situation where the feds are building us lots of new infrastructure, and our agencies won't have the ops funds to use it. I realize that transit funding can be a bit wonky, so check [this presentation](https://t4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/James-Corless-Indy-academy-5-14-15.pdf) for more context\n\nThere's [a large coalition of organizations](https://www.savecaliforniatransit.org/#h.pi7ad553kzh3) fighting to ensure that transit funding gets into the budget. Frankly, we're losing, and things don't look good if they keep going how they're going. Assuming nothing changes, BART and Caltrain will be the first to collapse in 2025-26. The small bus agencies serving mid-sized towns &amp; suburbs will follow. San Jose's VTA and the LA Metro have the longest runways, with strong local funding, but even their budgets will run out by 2030. Muni may survive, but it will be a fraction of its former self, with 20 bus routes on the chopping block this year alone\n\nThe various transit agencies in California haven't always been perfectly run, and that's part of the reason why Phil Ting and others want to defund these systems. But the reality is, destroying our existing transit agencies won't magically make things better. The real answer is adequate funding accompanied by meaningful oversight. Please call Asm. Ting's office, sign the petition, and get involved in saving California's public transportation",

I can use busses to travel further if needed, there are plenty of smaller roads and well-placed bike paths away from traffic, and I love that I can reduce or increase the pedal assist depending on my mood.\n\nWhen my car was still working it occurred to me that cars are actually extremely overpowered. Even my little 4 cylinder just felt way too powerful. Who need this much power just to drive a couple miles?\n\nI get that cars have plenty of uses and it's a necessity for some, especially in the states, but wow I wish more cities were bike friendly.

      "title": "Auto Manufacturers don't like Automatic Emergency Braking ",
      "text": "\n\n\nIn April 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced a new rule requiring automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems in nearly all new cars and trucks sold starting in 2029. The AEB technology automatically stops a vehicle if it detects a potential collision with another car or pedestrian. \n\nHowever, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a trade group representing major automakers, has petitioned the NHTSA to reconsider the rule, calling it \"practically impossible\" and excessively costly to meet. \n\nThere could be another reason that automobile manufacturers don't want highly effective AEB: About 25% of all car crashes will result in a total loss. If AEB eliminates most of these crashes, there will be less demand for replacement autos, both new and used, negatively impacting sales going forward. \n\nNHTSA's report, \u001cThe Economic and Societal Impact of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 2019,\u001d states that in 2019 23 million vehicles were damaged. \nEstimates are that 25% of those damaged vehicles were totalled: 5.8 million.\n\nSo crashes total approximately 5.8 million vehicles, creating demand for replacement vehicles. That turnover fuels both new and used car sales. **Effective AEB chokes off this revenue stream**, both by reducing the number of accidents and the seriousness of the remaining accidents. That revenue stream is approximately $180 Billion annually. An effective AEB could reduce the \"Crash &amp; Replace cycle\" by 50 to 90%, costing car dealers and manufacturers billions in sales.\n\nThese greedy A-holes are willing to allow the carnage to continue, carnage that kills more than 40,000 people annually so that their revenue isn't impacted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In many American places, police do not care about you stuffing 1500-3000w motors on these things. Use it to your advantage.

      "text": "Over on r/FuckCarscirclejerk there is frequently criticism of the facts and figures thrown around on this sub; [such as this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckCarscirclejerk/comments/11o0pg5/i_can_tell_you_for_one_no_one_is_paying_716_a). I too looked at that post an thought: \"man that seems high, is that right?\" So I decided to calculate my own annual cost of car ownership for comparison:\n\nI own a 2013 Prius C Two that was bought in 2013 new from a dealer. I bought it for its MSRP of $20,030, with $5,000 down and financed the rest at 4.5% apr. That equates to a total purchase cost of around $23,500. Spreading that over 10 years of ownership so far (without discounting because I'm lazy) equates to **$2,350 per year**.\n\nThe car has depreciated around 60% in the time that I've owned. Looking up the same model on AutoTempest it looks like a safe estimate for its current value is around $9,000. Spreading that value back over the 10 years of ownership (again with no discounting because again I'm lazy) means I can assess **$900 per year** back against my cost.\n\nThe car has been driven around 140,000 in the past 10 years, or 14,000 on average annually. It gets a combined 49.5mpg. Over the last 10 years in Indiana the average retail gas price for regular (again no discounting) has been $2.78/gal. This equates to an annual fuel cost of **$785 per year.**\n\nOver the last three years (2020, 2021, &amp; 2022) I have spent on average **$420 per year** on service and maintenance. in those three years I replaced the tires for the second time in the life of the car and the brakes for the first time in the life of the car so they are probably higher than average years.\n\nMy current insurance premium is **$950 per year.** I am a male in my late 20s so this is likely higher than the mean for most drivers. I also carry pretty high coverage and low deductibles.\n\nMy vehicle registration cost **$200 per year**. It's actually higher for me than most in Indiana because Indiana has higher registration fees for efficient vehicles to offset revenue losses from gas taxes.\n\nI have paid on average **$225 per year** for parking.\n\nSum all that up and you get a **total annual cost of $4,030.** This is no doubt a sizable chunk of cash, but no where near as high as many posts on the sub would lead you to believe. **Granted I own a relatively cheap car that is rather efficient**, I can't help that others make worse buying choices. (I acknowledge that cost of ownership is highly subsidized in many ways and does not contain any of the external cost to the world, that is not the point of this post.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you may be thinking: \"Who fucking cares u/Adept_Duck= It's still expensive as shit and in a more perfect world you wouldn't have to own a car at all!\" To you, I say, you are correct, but when advocating for change, it is in the interest of the advocator to not open themselves up to unnecessary scrutiny and argument. Data that appears counterfactual with only a cursor review is not persuasive, in fact it is counterproductive, leading opponents to loose faith in your credibility and discount all of your argumentation. For data such as cost of ownership, averages provide limited utility and ranges would be better used. Additionally transparency about calculation method and assumptions should be provided. The goal is encourage people to question why they spend so much on personal transportation cost (myself included; $11 a day WTF!) not to look at something and go \"there's no way its that expensive, that must be made up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Edited to incorporate feedback from commenters.\\*",

While American and European Auto industries are making cars nearly unaffordable, the Chinese EV industry is threatening to undercut them and ruin their fun. If the cheap EVs do come, then there may be a surge in EVs on the road, but I don't think it would be permanent. This may be a great opportunity to reduce the power of the Auto industry in our countries and reduce our dependence on cars.\n- Chinese electric Cars are small. I don't want a ton of cars on the road, but if we are going to have cars on the road then I'd rather have a small electric cars than huge SUVs that we already have.\n- Chinese EVS are cheap, and they undercut the competition. Anything that hurts the lobbying power of the Auto industry is a good thing and it helps wean us off car dependency.\n- Anti-China sentiment may fuel boycotts for Chinese products( Chinese EVS ) . This might help create a public transport boom.\n- An auto industry crash may cause a bit of economic turmoil, but it is the best chance we have to remove car dependence from our societies.

      "title": "Poland and its car culture.",
      "text": "I've experienced car culture and its effects many times. For starters, Poland and its cities are walkable and have great public transit. After WW2, the government started to build lots of neighborhoods made out of prefab panel blocks with green spaces and services in between. They have at least one arterial road connecting them to the city along with public transit. One square km can fit as much as 20 000 people depending on the neighborhood and its plans. The first car for the people was Fiat 126p, it appeared in 1977 and many people bought it. The passenger train network was developed as well as the intercity bus network. But then came 1989 and the fall of socialism. People immediately started to earn more money and bought cars. Housing cooperatives and housing estate administrations started to build more and more parking lots to make room for all these cars. Malls and supermarkets with even bigger parking lots were built and they became busy immediately. Housing developers immediately started building new high, medium, and low-density housing. They often were mixed-use if high-density but had lots of parking lots, often leaving barely any spaces for a pedestrian. Highways and dual carriageway expressways were built, with a grid all over the country. The suburbs became a thing, yet they are connected to a street with a bus. Passenger rail quality dropped and PKS, the intercity bus service became poor and a symbol of the socialist period. Cities, especially their centers became polluted due to traffic, especially transit traffic despite ring roads made of highways and expressways. Recently, fuel-guzzling, space-occupying, and deadly SUVs became more and more popular as people became even richer, and copying the west is the priority here. Now pedestrian deaths dropped a bit. You now need to give way to a pedestrian on a pedestrian crossing, it is illegal to kill them and you need to drive 50 kmh or 30 mph in a built-up area. Most drivers and people are at least partially carbrains. They argue that car-dependent suburbia is nice and that owning a car is their own business. Politicians mostly from the right are too, like when they say that they don't want a dictatorship of cyclists. Whenever a city tries to add bus and bike lanes or reduce parking lot sizes, crabrains write on the internet about how they are discriminated against and if someone is talking about bikes and that they're good, they say that you won't drive it in winter or snow. And they say that the car has a stopping distance of meters and that pedestrians should be more careful and not jump under the wheels and hood. Well, if you need 60m to stop, then you should be careful because of what weapon you have. And the police don't take this seriously most of the time. All while neighborhoods of prefab blocks of flats are still in high demand.                     \n\nWriting this was hard, considering how walkable cities can be, yet drivers think that they're the only ones who can have full rights.",

It\u0019s surprising how inefficient cars and road infrastructure are. The cycle to work only takes about 10 minutes longer than my drive. \n\nIn a sense I feel liberated. There\u0019s a sense of freedom in not having to worry about weekly fuel expenses, servicing, insurance costs, etc. \n\nIt made me wonder if anybody else has made the decision to go 100% car free? Is going car free even possible where you live? \n\nIf anyone else is debating going car free, I can\u0019t recommend it enough. Not driving the past month has really been enjoyable, with little sacrifice.",

Vance wants tax rebates for gas cars instead of EVs](https://qz.com/jd-vance-trump-gas-car-rebates-evs-1851594703)\n\n&gt;*As recently as 2020 Vance was seen praising solar energy and begged for a \u001cclean energy future\u001d to cure the \u001cclimate problem in our society.\u001d When it became clear to him that he\u0019d need Donald Trump\u0019s endorsement to win the Ohio senate race, he began a dramatic shift his positions on climate denialism and fossil fuels. This bill proved to Trump that Vance would kiss the ring in exchange for power, killing the old Vance to grow a new one in his image.*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*The Drive American Act seeks to gut the Biden administration\u0019s electric vehicle tax rebate program, with the first half of the bill undoing the program altogether. In the latter half of the bill, Vance proposes that American taxpayers follow him into a ridiculously circular logic that would instead place up to a $7,500 rebate on all new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, trucks, and SUVs. Vehicles with larger payloads and more seats would be eligible for more of the incentive. In order to take advantage of this, you\u0019d need to live in a household making less than $300,000, and the vehicle could not exceed $80,00o. Both \u001climits\u001d are well north of average.* ",

      "text": "Not sure if this has been posted yet.. couldn't find it anyways - but we got featured in Carbrain monthly! Be sure to check out the comments section for some great nuanced takes from the car persons. (/s)\n\n[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you imagine your life without a car or a truck? Do you see yourself biking to work or taking the bus every single day? Are you ready to carry groceries and supplies like in the old days? Well, this is what some people are dreaming of. We\u0019re not talking about 100, 1,000, or 10,000 people. No, there are over 217,000 supporters of the anti-car movement! It\u0019s worth understanding what they want, since these ideas tend to spread like wildfire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to a subreddit that has a very explicit name, people that are in favor of banning cars are not looking to make emergency vehicles disappear, they don\u0019t want to disrupt the supply chains dependent on trucks, and don\u0019t look at rural communities to make their plan happen. They also underline that the initiative isn\u0019t political and doesn\u0019t adhere to any set of \u001cleft\u001d or \u001cright\u001d values and beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What these guys and gals wish is to make everyone aware of the cost that we must all support because cars became so important for almost anything we do. This is clearer now that we\u0019ve all gradually returned to normal office hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-car community essentially agrees that building the roads and the needed utilities creates \u001can unwanted economic burden on communities\u001d that has proven to be costly everywhere, especially when you look at the yearly amount of dollars spent on maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they say this won\u0019t stop with the switch to all-electric and self-driving cars, since charging and moving around without human control will almost certainly guarantee the number of vehicles won\u0019t come down, and more money will be needed for charging and resting spots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Not enough room for everyone**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People also think cities give too much space to cars, parking, and gas or charging stations. They want more parks, schools, homes, and businesses instead of vehicles in populated urban areas. Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand, which translates into more cars everywhere if roads are widened and parking spots are created.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These online activists also underline that not everyone can simply buy and drive a vehicle. They say children, teenagers, impoverished parents and adults, and those unable to drive suffer a lot in \u001ccar-centric cities.\u001d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-car movement supporters also argue motor vehicles are dangerous. Occupants may benefit from increased levels of protection as automotive technology evolves and companies create new materials that are lighter, stronger, yet dissipate impact energy in a very efficient way, but those that are not in a car might not survive an impact with one \u0013 something that everybody knows since childhood. But these people insist exercising any *\u001cform of car-free liberty\u001d* is automatically linked to constant threat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They also say cars are nurturing isolation, since people don\u0019t meet so often to have a chat on a sidewalk. You may be inclined to bring up car communities and events, but keep in mind activists are only referring to city life. Urban dwellers might enjoy some more space for weekend activities or just walk to and from work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A change must happen, but not like this**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, the idea to ban cars remains a discussion on [a popular forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/). But the number of people that agree with this idea is frightening. It\u0019s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much, but giving up on fossil fuels and designing better cities might just do the trick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A change is clearly needed, but it can\u0019t happen without motor vehicles. They are an integral part of the U.S. (and the world) and of a major industry, while some certain models create entire communities, and even inspire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All in all, banning cars from public roads and crowded cities might be applicable in specific cases or in some locations, but the U.S. is not ready in any way, shape, or form to give up entirely on motor vehicles. New York City is already struggling with keeping traffic under control after they\u0019ve made more space for bicycles and buses. People have various needs when it comes to reaching different destinations, and we can\u0019t take the comfort of knowing they can go everywhere they need at any given time without offering a public infrastructure that\u0019s working continuously and without delays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle, be it a battery-electric or a fuel-cell (hydrogen) one.",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That\u0019s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.\u001d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/air-pollution-in-nsw-causes-603-premature-deaths-and-costs-48bn-a-year-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\n**The NSW Clean Air Strategy 2021-2030**\n\n\nDoes address cars and trucks with:\n\n*Zero Emissions Bus Transition Strategy* to transition to electric battery buses and hydrogen fuel cell technology. \n\n*Walking and Cycling Program*  to create cycling and walking connections/parths around Sydney.\n\n *NSW Electric Vehicle Strategy* to increase electric vehicle use through government rebates and building charges.",

Nobody really knows.\u001d The former US president added that rising sea levels, caused by melting glaciers, would have the benefit of creating \u001cmore oceanfront property\u001d.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk, meanwhile, said it was wrong to \u001cvilify\u001d the oil and gas industry, the key driver of planet-heating pollution, and that the only imperative to ditch fossil fuels was that they will one day run dry.\n\n&gt;\u001cIf we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,\u001d said Musk, who is also chief executive of the electric car company Tesla. \u001cWe do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;\u001cWe still have quite a bit of time & we don\u0019t need to rush and we don\u0019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that. Like, leave the farmers alone.\u001d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk said the main danger of allowing carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere was that at some point it will become difficult to breathe, causing \u001cheadaches and nausea\u001d to people. This would occur with CO2 at about 1,000 parts per million of the Earth\u0019s atmosphere, more than double the current record-breaking concentrations.\n\nTo be clear, this is a problem soon because we're talking about indoor air which needs to be replaced with outdoor air. The higher outdoor CO2 concentration makes that process more difficult. We don't have to wait until the atmospheric levels are 1000 ppm https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000237 \n\nI think this pretty much confirms what we've been saying for years:  electric cars are here to save the car industry, not the planet. \n\n",

I booked a \"VW golf or similar\" from Europcar, but when I went to the rental station they said they could only offer me a Jeep Renegade, or something even bigger. Sigh. I just wanted to get on the road so I took it. I thought \"fuck it, it's only a few days, and hey, maybe I'll see what all the fuss is about.\"\n\nFUCK. ME.\n\nWhat an awful vehicle. Suspension was shockingly bad on the motorway, it felt like we were bouncing our way there, I pulled over twice as I was sure we had a flat tyre or that something else was wrong. Then there was the fuel efficiency, I had half a tank after only 300km. When it was almost empty, it cost 120 Euro to fill it (@ ¬1.7 / L). but the biggest surprise of all was safety. I actually felt \\*less\\* safe than in a smaller car. I could feel the handling was poor at higher speeds. It was raining the whole way there, and the road was wet. After some regular maneuverers (switching lanes for example) I felt very aware of how top-heavy the vehicle was. By the time I got to Munich the idea of driving it on narrow alpine roads or trying to find parking in small Italian towns was filling me with dread. I changed it for a hatchback and immediately felt much better. The rest of the trip was fun, smooth, and much more economical. Lastly, I don't ever know how its possible, but our luggage took up all the space in the trunk of both cars, despite one being twice to size of the other.\n\nI hate SUVs, but I always assumed for the driver, there must be some obvious advantages.

Because I wanted to tell you that the country could be out of gas for cars after next weekend (if they're still striking). It means that people will be unable to use their cars if they're not electric, airlines in Iceland would shut down next weekend (if still striking) but it would have some big consequences for the people here, like lack of products in every store (including food) because Iceland is so car-dependent. This also means that public transit (which is almost all based on gas) could also shut down and it might cause that a lot of people will be unable to get to work (unable to drive and possibly taking public transit).

The Labour government looks set to - at the very least - remove the 5p a litre subsidy that has been in place since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to some analysis, the subsidy costs the UK government £14bn a year (source: https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2024/03/07/uk-budget-the-cost-of-freezing-fuel-duty/).\n\nIn fact, the cost is likely much higher, because of other impacts like the subsidy increasing carbon emissions by 7% (source: https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-fuel-duty-freezes-have-increased-uk-co2-emissions-by-up-to-7/):\n\nIf anything, the UK government should not just raise it by 5p. It should be raised to where it would have been had no interference taken place, which is closer to 10p a litre.\n\nThen give businesses the ability to claim commercial use back to reduce it to it to its current level. But for personal use, it should be ramped up.\n\nDriving is too cheap; as much as many drivers love to complain about the cost, they quite happily sit idling with their engine running, or waste fuel taking their kids to school when they live a walkable distance away.",

I cannot understand why because:\n\n# Good things about limiting all cars to 25 km/h:\n\n* If busses and trains go much faster than cars, this will increase the use of public transportation over long distances and decrease the use of cars. It will also increase the use of bikes because cars would no longer have a speed advantage.\n* Inside of towns cars won't be racing around pedestrians and cyclists. Instead, they will match the speed of cyclists. ( **This is the main reason** )\n* Assuming that car motors get designed for 25 km/h, they would become much more fuel efficient. Compare 130km/h + 20 headwind with 25 km/h + 20 headwind, the car would have only 9% air resistance at 25 km/h as it would at 130 km/h. This will greatly increase the fuel efficiency.\n* Highways will become accessible to everyone: not only cars, but also cyclists could now legally and safely use them.\n* Unless on a highway... going fast can be very stressful.\n* No more noise pollution from cars traveling at high speeds\n* Because less accidents happen, insurance will become much cheaper so this is even a good thing for the drivers!\n* Bike paths would probably not be necessary anymore.\n\n# Bad things about limiting all cars to 25 km/h:\n\n* Commute takes longer, inconvenient to drivers. But there is the option to use faster public transportation.\n* Slower in case of emergencies. But even this is not nearly as bad as all the deaths caused by high speed vehicles.\n\nUnless I missed something big, it is extremely obvious that limiting every car to 25 km/h has more bigger upsides than downsides.",

      "text": "Me and my partner would like to visit Milan for a weekend and we live in Lausanne. The connections are fantastic. A one-way train, takes a bit over 3 hours. Scheduled at the right times for us too. On paper, everything sounds amazing, and I guess it is in real life too, if you're rich. \n\nWe'd be paying over ¬280 for the train, and these are the cheapest tickets available. \n\nIts 660km round trip. At 7.5L/100km and ¬1.85/L, that's 91 euros. The drive is 20 minutes longer than the train. So guess what we are going to do, however much I hate to say it. \n\nEurope, get your fucking act together. Most people are on a budget and can't afford to throw money at trains when driving is so much cheaper (if you have a car anyway). Our trains are excellent, but the prices are inaccessible. Stop funding \"new lanes and smoother roads\", start subsidizing train fares to actually make people want to use them. It's called public transport, not private transport. And public services are supposed to be publicly funded. \n\nTrain are NOT supposed to be a luxury. That's what cars are supposed to be.\n\nEdit: Booking flights to Edinburgh turned out to be cheaper overall than taking the train to Milan. So that's where we are going. And I'm actually taking the train to the airport instead of driving, but I managed to get \"supersaver tickets\" for that, but none were available for Milan.\nSorry, but the European train pricing system is completely fucked. It truly needs to step up its game and compete with the cost of fuel (not the cost of car ownership) if it ever wants to become competitive in the eyes of the average car-owning person. And it especially needs to be able to compete with planes.",

      "text": "I wanted to share a personal experience on how not owning a car has significantly boosted my savings and helped build wealth over time.\n\nLiving in a tier-1 city presents its own unique set of challenges, but it has also provided me with valuable lessons on smart investments. For instance, instead of buying a car\u0014which I could have easily afforded\u0014I chose to invest the money that would have otherwise gone towards the initial cost, insurance, maintenance, fuel, and repairs. This decision has not only saved me a significant amount of money but also allowed me to allocate those funds into more profitable and less depreciating assets. By making this choice, I\u0019ve been able to grow my wealth and avoid the financial burden that often comes with car ownership in a busy urban environment.\n\nI decided to move closer to my office, which significantly saved me both money and time. The daily 2 km walk not only helped me stay fit but also freed up extra time for my hobbies. On days when I felt too tired to walk, I conveniently used carpooling services and Uber. This change has really boosted my health and productivity, showing it's a smart and cost-effective choice.\n\nChoosing not to own a car has been one of the best financial decisions I've made!

      "text": "And all of this under a post showing how the US lost much of its train network through the decades, ironically enough. Seriously where do people get this idea and how do we convince people that it's not a conspiracy? \n\nThe question is kind of rhetorical as many people making such claims have per-confirmed beliefs which say otherwise (which automatically means they're right to them despite not posting any sources) and will not listen to reason no matter how sound it is.\n\nYou're telling me that car manufacturers making bigger and bigger vehicles (US ones in particular as this wasn't the norm in the world) for seemingly no reason, suddenly saying how everyone needs all of that \"utility and size\" and phasing out smaller, older cars and their parts isn't them manipulating the market and making people pay more for more fuel inefficient, dangerous vehicles. (And I fucking love how apparently the entire US suddenly lives in a secluded part of the country in some log cabin with no electricity, with having to drive 50 miles through ice and snow, and they say they all need their trucks, riiiiiiiight)\n\n  \nYou're telling me they didn't lobby politicians to build more roads and highways, often bulldozing poor, POC neighbourhoods which were areas of dense housing, and if it wasn't that it was bulldozed to construct bunch of samey looking single family homes (with car garages ofc).\n\nYou're telling me, that, back when cars were first introduced en masse, they caused a bunch of crashes but didn't try to victim blame pedestrians so they can make roads more friendly for cars. Yeah a world that was so used to walking on roads were all very happy suddenly that roads were excluded from walking on said roads, totally.\n\nYou're telling me that, despite the US being very similar to the rest of the world before cars and that almost every town and village had some rail connecting them to larger cities, it's just that rail fell out of favour and no one was using it anymore suddenly (because buying cars worth thousands was apparently a very enticing financial decision), so that's why rail closed down has got nothing to do with the auto industry.\n\nYou're also telling me that it's not the autoindustry's fault that public transit, dense housing, better cycling infrastructure and such faces MASSIVE backlash and protests from people who they totally didn't carwash? (Reminder, Elon Musk admitted to sabotaging the Californian High Speed Rail project)\n\nLet's also not mention other dumb shit which the auto industry totally didn't try to play down and play dumb... Like adding lead to fuel, ignoring warnings and its sideffects for... decades... \n\nEven if all of this was just a huge coincidence (it absolutely wasn't), then it's the dumbest, most unfortunate and selfish (and in some conscious decisions, extremely vile and racist ) set of circumstances the US (and other parts of the world) got themselves into.\n\nSo, what the fuck? How do you even keep up with these mental gymnastics? I'm asking as a genuine question.\n\nI get it, all corporations bend the truth and play dirty tricks for profits, but why is it suddenly the car and oil industry that were angels the whole time?",

Our coworker was walking home last night and was struck by a truck while in a marked crosswalk, killing him and leaving behind his wife and daughter without a breadwinner. He had fallen and slipped on the ice, and couldn't get up in time. The truck, being lifted with a huge front end, prevented the driver from seeing him, and it ran him over while he was trying to crawl to safety. We closed down for the day, and my coworker drove me home.\n\nLast summer my mother-in-law was hit by a car and killed. The vehicle was pulling out of a parking lot and was going over 20 according to witnesses. Police made no report or arrest even though they were there. Turns out the man who killed my MIL was a retired police officer, and his son was one of the officers present. My sister and brother-in-law are suing the state.\n\nA few years ago my childhood friend was killed walking home from work when a vehicle exiting their driveway struck her. Her adoptive family couldn't sue the driver on her behalf in order to cover funeral expenses due to old state laws. Back when railroad workers were imported from China, companies lobbied to pass a law preventing families from suing on behalf of deceased relatives so that their Chinese laborer deaths wouldn't make the railroad companies liable. My friend's adopted family, Chinese Americans themselves, petitioned the state legislature to get the law struck from the books and won.\n\nNone of these people I knew were in the wrong place at the wrong time. All of them were walking exactly where they were supposed to be walking and were killed by fools piloting fossil-fuel-powered 1-ton battering rams. I don't own a vehicle; I walk and bike everywhere I go, I've lost 3 people in my life to vehicle/pedestrian collisions, and I'm constantly afraid that one of these cars passing me is being driven by an idiot, that I'm going to end up a statistic that most people look at and say \"oh well, I like the freedom of owning a Ford F150, America!\"\n\nFuck cars.",

      "text": "I have had some version of this conversation with so many different people and always makes me laugh when I get pushback on this statement. I am pretty sure most folks have no idea how much their cars cost them. \n\nI just tell them to do the math and everyone of them has a hard time stomaching that if anything $500 is often low. My math :)\n\n* Average gallon of gas: $3.50 (I live in California so this is low for us high for others, but over 10 years probably reasonable)\n* Annual Mileage: 10k miles\n* Average MPG: 30 miles\n* Annual cost of insurance: $1k\n* One time purchase cost: $20k\n\nMaking a couple assumptions that you keep the car for 10 years (longer than many do), that the cost of maintenance is about the same as what you spend on gas (I heard this is a good general estimate of maintenance costs), and you do not pay any interest on the purchase:\n\n* Cost of fuel is: (($3.50 per gallon * 10,000 miles)/ 30 MPG) * 10 years = ~$11.6K\n* Maintenance cost: $11.6k\n* Insurance: $1,000 * 10 years = $10,000\n* Purchase cost: $20,000\n\n* The total 10 year cost : $10k + $11.6k + $11.6k + $20k = $53k\n* Annual cost : $53k / 10 years = $5.3K / year\n* Monthly cost : $5.3k / 12 months = ~$450 / month\n\nSo a bit lower than $500 but these are conservative estimates and most of the folks I have this debate with keep their car for 5 years, pay interest on their purchase, pay way more than $20k for the car, and pay more than $1k per year for insurance.",

A carbon tax is [widely regarded](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0474-0.epdf?author_access_token=tst1A-oZnQ8zUO18wGGPQdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nfy3PIgvrwnNXQzIbXH8z1Wkqhm6g5NiMnxMk__ebsKxGQNB0hMf1Vpo-ZiNplSt5LeLyks-Q3sdrpBdfxxHvAfQylqqwqHxgEml7GEGOxaQ%3D%3D) as the single most impactful climate mitigation policy.\n\n[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level). \n\nTaxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (it [saves lives at home](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x)) and [many nations have already started](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the \"rich\" can afford fossil fuels in the first place. We [won\u0019t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224); the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).\n\nJust [eight years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20140723120752/http://closup.umich.edu/issues-in-energy-and-environmental-policy/13/public-views-on-a-carbon-tax-depend-on-the-proposed-use-of-revenue/), only 30% of the public supported a carbon tax. Four years ago, [it was over half (53%)](https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx). Now, [it's an overwhelming majority (73%)](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/ps_2020-06-23_government-and-climate_00-01/) \u0013 and that [does actually matter for passing a bill](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651).

According to NASA climatologist and climate activist [Dr. James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen), becoming an [active volunteer with Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://cclusa.org/x) is [the most important thing you can do for climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8). Climatologist [Dr. Michael Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Mann) calls its [Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend) policy [an example of the sort of visionary policy that's needed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/). And [**having more volunteers helps**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizensClimateLobby/comments/tonz9h/districts_with_more_ccl_volunteers_have_more/).\n\n[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is *necessary* if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with \"high confidence\" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

The idea [won a Nobel Prize](http://environment.yale.edu/news/article/william-nordhaus-wins-nobel-prize-for-economics-of-climate-change/).

I bought one last year, because my car died, and I needed a vehicle on the cheap - because well, without one, getting to work is impossible. \n\nI hate how the SUV gets lousy gas mileage like a small truck, with much less ability to do truck like stuff. \n\nI hate how SUVs are built on car platforms but with truck style bodies to make them have the ability to drive like a car, but sway like a school bus if you have to swerve out of the way. \n\nI hate how consumerist the SUV is! Look at all the shit you can haul!!! Like we didn\u0019t have vehicles that could hold all your shit before. \n\nI hate how they are basically pedestrian killers. They sit higher, they are loaded with screens to take your eyes off the road, and well, since they are heavier than a normal car, take more time to stop. \n\nI got into bike riding a year ago. Hardcore. Road, gravel, MTB - love it all. I enjoy traveling by bike. Being able to appreciate the world around me, feeling the wind, not being bound to a road. \n\nThe area in which I live is bound by roads. Poorly maintained roads that have also not at all kept up with the growth of the area. Driving absolutely sucks here. I hate doing it. Also, what are we mainly driving for? To go to work. To pay for the car that gets us to work. \n\nI\u0019m tired of hearing about how much taxes would go up to have competent public transportation. Are you seriously thinking it would be more than the weekly fueling up, the monthly insurance payment, the car payment, or if paid off, the inevitable service costs of maintaining a car? I think not.  Also, adequate public transportation would probably reduce road maintance costs, reduce our need for petroleum, give us a few more green spaces, multi use trails, and maybe a few less hours at work, because the expenses aren\u0019t so high. \n\nAnd the SUV is the perfect device to keep us plugging along, ignoring the whole problem they created. \n",

I live in California and they\u0019ve paved over paradise to add \u001cone more lane.\u001d I was trying to exist on my bike and recently e-bike but it\u0019s not enough.

There is no public transit here. I did my safety classes, obsessed on bikes and weighed pros and cons then I bought one. Do I like the idea that I still use fossil fuel, fuck no! Other than that though it has been an amazing shift. I can do everything and more. I can bypass traffic. Getting lost is no longer stressful it\u0019s a new way to explore. Being on a bike invites conversation. I talk to so many that would love to get out of their giant suvs and hop on two wheels. Maybe it\u0019s not much and I know the whole system needs to change, but this is taking on car dependence in my own way. I can be apart of nature not in a box sheltering from it. I can smell all the smells and my anxiety has gone down from having to hop on a bicycle to compete with cars. Being able to accelerate quickly is peace of mind. Working on the bike has been a joy too which is surprising because I never liked wrenching on cars. \n\nI know it\u0019s dangerous but it\u0019s not like cars are safe. I still want trains and trams. I want clean air. I know I am vulnerable but we all are. I watched a huge dodge pickup miss a mountain turn a day ago and land on the cab after a 20 ft drop. I\u0019m not sure if they survived. \n\nIt feels like I found a cheat code and I wanted to say my experiences. I think that if more people were on bikes the world would be a better place.

      "title": "\"Idling cars don't use much fuel\" -- my thoughts",
      "text": "Saw a conversation on here about how cars, when idling, are very efficient and don't use a lot of fuel. Knowing that, maybe some would say that it's okay to leave your car idling in the winter.\n\nProblems with cars don't just come from fuel consumption. It's also about emissions -- and not just CO2 and climate change.\n\nI want to tell you all a story from when I was younger.\n\nAround 4 years ago, I went to a small music festival out in the woods. Middle of nowhere. The air out there is as clean as it gets unless you're willing to do some hardcore hiking. People drive their cars out to this big empty field surrounded by trees, and then they turn their cars off. Generators are banned except by the festival crew for running sound systems and lights.\n\nAll that to say, there are basically no engines running out there.\n\nThat time of year, it gets cold at night. My partner and I did some LSD and smoked some weed. Weed makes your body temperature drop, so we were freezing our butts off. LSD makes you notice all kinds of stuff you wouldn't normally notice, like smells.\n\nWe decide to go sit in the car and run the heater for a little bit, just so we can get a break from the cold. We're sitting in there nice and comfortable. I need to... I don't know, brush my teeth or something, so I get out of the car.\n\nRight away, I'm hit by the smell of exhaust. Our one car idling in this field is making the air all around us smell like shit. Thank god none of our neighbors were home, or else I would have felt bad about polluting their space. Our car was just one car. Imagine if all of them were running. Imagine a whole city of cars.\n\nIt's the kind of thing you don't notice, normally. You get used to that smell, in the city. If I was sober, I probably would have ignored it completely. It would have just been normal. But I didn't tune it out, then.\n\nEver since, I smell it. I've never allowed myself to be desensitized again. Some roads smell worse than others. Sometimes when I'm on the freeway, I can tell the difference between the smells of different cars.\n\nThat smell isn't just unpleasant. It's not just a quality of life issue.\n\nThat smell is giving people cancer.\n\nDon't let your cars sit and idle.",

Usually.\n\nBut this costs money in fuel and wear and tear.  So I stopped driving to work.  \n\nIn the summer I switched to ebike.  It takes 90 minutes to get to work.  Getting 3 hours of physical activity is a good thing.  So I dropped a bunch of weight.  I leave home earlier and I get home at 4:30pm.  3 hours of exercise costs me 1 hour of evening home time.  This is worth it.\n\nIf it is raining or dreadful out, I switch to walking and transit.  I walk 6km daily and take the skytrain and bus.  I get my daily minimum exercise, save money and read or reddit or whatever.  Traffic ain't so bad when you can have your nose in a book.\n\nPeople at work ask how I can spend so much time commuting.

Did a little experiment and drove the speed limit for a week and drove over the speed limit (like most cars in my city) for the next.

Now I don\u0019t know about most people but risking points, tickets, accidents, and getting much worse fuel economy isn\u0019t worth the 4 minutes I save. I actually saved money by driving the limit because I consumed less fuel and spent less time at red lights. I got 5.6 L/100 km (41 mpg) on the week I wasn\u0019t speeding, and 6.8 L/100 km (34 MPG) on the week I was speeding.

It can fit my bike and any lugguage in the back easily so it's very helpful (for a car anyway...). My car is quite old but I just found out they don't make the station wagon version anymore - it seems everyone is getting SUVs instead! Out of interest I checked the boot space information online and the station wagon actually has way more than the SUV, also uses less fuel, greater visibility etc etc. What is going on here??? Do people just want to be higher up from the ground?? I really don't get it!! As a cyclist a station wagon just seems so much safer/closer to road level and also more efficient.

      "text": "A short while ago I was in an argument with someone saying how high speed rail is not economically viable because American cities are built for the car and if you want to travel long distance, it's much cheaper to take a plane ticket than a train ticket.\n\nArguing aside, my main concern was what will happen when easily accessible fuels will all but disappear. There are other methods to extract and refine oil from places but they're much more expensive. There are also biofuels but a lot of farmland of corn needs to be diverted to the production of said biofuels. Corn is used for the production of foods and feeding livestock. Diverting a huge amount of that produced corn for fuel would make the food market price absolutely skyrocket.\n\nSo I suggested that we make towns more efficient with how they're planned, provide more affordable and dense housing, provide good inner city public transit, provide reasonable alternatives to driving cars and provide people with high speed rail between major cities. We should save the cheaper, more easily extractable fuels for other purposes as well as greatly reduce its consumption and thus, reduce impact on the environment\n\nThey began parroting how it's not economical to do that and I asked what is their plan for such fuels run out. \"We will eventually figure out a solution\".\n\nSo is that it? You want to delay fixing a very serious and KNOWN problem that can very well potentially devastate many things about life as we know it, all in the hopes that someone intelligent will come along and fix this problem. That whose fix we've already known about for decades and basically solved but you still deny its implementations because It wON't bE eCOnoMicAL. You could bulldoze apartments and businesses for car infrastructure and single family housing but you can't picture doing so again to revert the now well known and studied mistakes in modern society. \n\nIt's likely that the person just doesn't care because they'll be very old or dead so they don't have to deal with the consequences. Meanwhile here I am dealing with 30-40 degree summers and dying, and my town's renovating roads and building more free parking instead of planting tree shade.",

However, this trend has negative effects on the environment as SUVs produce around one-third more greenhouse gas emissions per kilometer than cars on average. This trend threatens Canada's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-50% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. A study found that while SUV drivers are drawn to the vehicle for its comfort, style, and safety, some were willing to downsize due to policy changes.

      "text": "I recently got a new job, it's about 14 miles distant by direct measurement, but it's in an inner suburb and I live in a different inner suburb, so the quickest transit is to go into the downtown and back out again, and that adds up to a lot\n\nby transit my commute is 90 minutes to 2 hours (depending if I do transit only or drive+transit), while by car it's 30 minutes to 80 minutes (depending on the traffic); I get free parking at my place of work so...my resolve to commute via transit is faltering a lot; 3 to 4 hours per work day on transit is *a lot*; add on top of that that transit where I live is hardly reliable: I did a test run and I added a good half-hour due to late busses and subways\n\nultimately, I would love to live car-free, but that feels like an increasingly unobtainable goal given just how long it takes to get to work; I know that there are a lot of hidden costs to driving that you have to take into account beyond just gas and insurance, but with transit fares at $14 per day (plus another $5 if I choose to park-and-ride) it's just difficult for me to not see driving as more viable at least until I can move to somewhere closer to where I work\n\nthanks in advance, trying my best not to give up\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the input! I realized I'm actually really lucky that there's a fully grade-separated bike path at least half of the way that goes literally right to my workplace's front door, so I could combine an e-bike with transit",

      "text": "For context I live in Worcester and work in Boston Massachusetts. Ever since starting my job I've never once driven to the office, I always drive to the train station and take the commuter rail because I like trains and hate driving.\n\nNow unfortunately today the MBTA did its usual thing and melted down, meaning I had to drive into the office. I'm now home and it left me wondering genuinely why do people drive to work in the city when okayish commuter rail is just as slow as driving?\n\nUsually my commute door-to-door is about 2 hours inbound and 1 hour 45 minutes outbound on the train. And driving door-to-door was 1 hour and 25 minutes inbound and...1 hour and 45 minutes outbound? And the train + parking at the commuter rail station is cheaper than parking in the city (not to mention less gas money, no tolls, much less miles on the car). \n\nPlus you can do whatever you wish on the train, sleep, eat, beat everyones ass in word hunt - and i'd much rather look out the window of a train rather than my rear view mirror thinking oh god not another Ford F150 trailing my ass again!\n\nAnyway I end today being even more confused as to why a) America doesn't invest in even decent train infrastructure that could handily beat driving and b) why people drive to work in major cities when a self-driving car called a train (that will go just as slow as your car, at least in america) exists.",

      "text": "Edit: I would like to and want to move, but moving cost money that I don't have, which is why I am trying to get a job. Thanks for the advice otherwise though. And my main concern is that I can't get a decent job as many places require me to have a license/car and are far from me.  \n\n\n(I'm in US if anyone cares)\n\nIt just feels like I am destined for failure without a car, I just can't do anything. I am lucky enough that I can bike around my town, but that's about it, going anywhere out of town is out of the question, getting a job is a pain in the ass, friends want to hang out somewhere? I need a ride, I want to go somewhere a bit further out? Oh well, better hope there's a bike route or I can find a ride. So much of my town and area doesn't even have side walks, just roads, whole neighborhoods with no sidewalks.\n\nThere aren't any decent paying jobs near me, and all we have here that I can easily get to are stores, and it doesn't even matter if I can get to the place or not half the time when there's a job I want I look through it \"requirements: drivers license\" even some random minimum wage jobs have this, I've had people even offer me jobs but then ask \"but do you have a car?\". I'm tired of this, I'm tired of my mother getting on me for not having my license yet, I'm tired of feeling like a burden on people for not being able to afford a car, I'm tired of feeling trapped in this town because I can't get a better job.\n\nI don't even fucking want a car, cars have been nothing but a plight on my family for years, without fail every year the biggest issue is \"the car has a problem an needs fixed\" just constant money down the drain, even at work my coworkers and managers stressing about something that needs fixed on their car, something broke down, etc etc, then you need to pay for gas, insurance, new tires, it just never ends, even now, I helped my mom pay for a car with the hopes I'd be able to use it when I get my license but now the transmission is going out, everyone here is stuck buying old used cars and hoping they don't have some unknown issue because buying a new car cost more than what they make a year.\n\nBut I guess you could always get a car payment right? Another couple hundred dollars every month to worry about, just what you need, and for what? To get to places quicker? Carry groceries and protect from the weather, sure that's nice, but is it really worth all of the hassle? I don't think so, but it doesn't matter what I think I need a car anyways. They said driving is a privilege not right, but they damn well made sure that you life is a shit ton harder without this \"privilege\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Which has caused many people in my school to complain. \n\nFor context, I live in an urban area with a fairly extensive public transport system. It's far from ideal but everyone manages to get to school. As students we get *free* metro passes that are good for the entire year. All of this means that intracity travel is fairly accessible.\n\nLike many people here, my opinion is a little bit more nuanced than \"cars bad\" and if people living in rural areas or public transport dead zones are forced to drive then I have sympathy for them. But if the solution to your issue at the gas pump is staring you dead in the face, four dollars a gallon is just the cost of your slothfulness.\n\nSo to bring this full circle I'll answer my classmate's question: \"It's gonna stop costing fifty dollars to fill your tank when you learn to ride the bus.\"",

      "text": "Every time I hear an American say \"but gas is 6$ per gallon!!\" or a European say \"A liter is 2.5¬!\" I just cant stop and think for myself, that is obscenely cheap. Its an absolute \"bargain\" for how much damage cars cause to our cities, countries, our health and the earth. \n\nEven if driving were to cost 2 or 3 times more I still wouldn't think its enough. the fact that some countries barely tax their gas and vehicles is so mind boggling to me. \n\nThat is not to say that I think driving should exclusively be a rich persons thing, Fuck the rich. I would prefer if most people that don't have to drive wouldn't drive but people care more about their money rather than doing the right thing. Maybe even if it was way more expensive we'd have more support for transit, cycling and walkable places worldwide. \n\n\n\nEdit: while i know this take is sadly radical, didnt expect it to be a bit too radical for r/fuckcars . I wanted to clarify by what I mean \"too cheap\" \n\nYeah owning a car is absurdly expensive, can range anywhere between 10k to 25k a year. Not to mention the cost of buying one in the first place. \nHowever all of this is not even the \"true\" price. The US is addicted to subsidized gas so the true price of gas is shocking to most. Even the true price doesn't come close to being enough considering how much damage is casued by them.  Taxing US gas at least to the levels of other western nations would be s good start. However gas is just cheap worldwide.",

They identified the number one, most impactful factor to generate demand for oil and it is (drumroll): cars.\n\nNot cruise ships, not containers ships, not private jets, not agriculture, not \u001cthe 100 corporations\u001d, not single-use plastic, but getting the most number of regular people to buy cars and drive them everywhere. \n\n(Note that I\u0019m not saying we should not care about these other sources of pollution, just setting things straight as these are used in countless instances to discredit environmental concerns with cars)\n\nThey focus on Africa because that\u0019s where the infrastructure is the least prevalent. They know full well that the way to generate car sales and traffic is to get governments to build roads and they will obviously \u001chelp\u001d them in that regard. Building car infrastructure entices people to buy cars and they will in turn demand more car infrastructure once they engineered their life around owning a car. The vicious circle is launched for generations like it was in the US and Western Europe in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe EPA also reports that the [biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the USA is transportation](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions), the biggest percentage of which is private cars (again, not commercial trucking or delivery vans but people driving individual cars to transport themselves and their phone and Big Gulp cup).",

Not only you have the pay the car straight up which is like $50,000 on average. You got monthly payments. Maintenance as these things break down. More money! Even gas is stupid expensive. $60 or more! That's ridiculous! You'll end up spending thousands of unneeded payments when you could be saving! You'll be financially ahead. Without a car, the amount you can save will be unmeasurable. Not only money will be saved. It's also better for the environment. If you're in a financial issue.

      "text": "Anyone else here in a mismatched marriage when it comes to carbrainedness? \n\nWe live in a really dense urban prewar neighbourhood - the perfect place to be car-free or car-lite. Both of us work less than 5km away from home, so our big stupid car sits unused most of the week. My spouse agreed to live here because it's \"cool\" to live downtown, but he would really much rather have a bigger house with a garage and stuff (he still thinks family who've bought mcmansions in new subdivisions are more \"grown up\"). He doesn't seem to register the costs of the car (ie will complain it's too expensive to rent a car and in the same week complain about the huge repair we had on the car). We keep the car because of \"camping\" and \"grocery shopping\" even though we camp twice a year and we live within walking and biking distance of a million groceries. \n\nNormally I just do my thing and let him do his. I know I'm lucky to live this lifestyle. Grocery shopping is his chore so I can't really complain if he wants to go do a massive haul at the big box store once a week by car. He thinks it's \"inefficient\" to make smaller trips by foot or bike. \n\nHe happens to work near the bakery of a product we really like that is also sold commercially in most groceries but he usually ends up buying it at the grocery store on his weekly trip instead of fresh from the bakery that he walks by daily. \n\nToday I was taking my kid to a sports event in the middle of nowhere, so I was very reluctantly out with the car. He texts me that they had been out of said product when he was shopping, so could I make a detour to the grocery chain and see if they had any? When I asked him why he couldn't just get them tomorrow when he literally walks by the store, he said they're cheaper at the grocery. Like time driving and gas are free. \n\nIt just never ceases to amaze me how strong the messaging is. He so strongly associates \"suburban\" things with being a grown up and success, and is so bad at weighing the costs of driving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Yet I also think the necessity for having a car is so hugely overblown - and was reminded of this recently not only by [this new video on the true cost of having a car](https://youtu.be/c2rI-5ZFW1E), and from returning to in-office work.\n\nReturning to in-person work a few days a week has reminded me just how irrationally ingrained the myth of needing a car is in the U.S. I live exactly .90 miles from my apartment door, to my office door on a college campus. Many of my colleagues and people who work in my building have houses in the same neighborhood, ranging from .50 miles to 1.5 to the building. Walking to work this week, I counted *five* of my colleagues living in that same neighborhood all driving this 1 mile to work. One of them stopped, perplexed that I was walking, and asked if I needed a ride. I could literally see the campus down the hill from where we were at. It is an 18-minute walk or 7-minute bike ride. They are paying 40k for the car by the looks of what they were driving, plus gas/registration/maintenance, plus parking on campus - which is $150 a semester - for a car that will sit in a parking lot unused for 99% of their day, all to save themselves 15 minutes??? How indoctrinated are we as a culture, that people cannot even imagine walking a mile? A few others live further away, but on a bus line - and the public bus to campus costs less for employees - yet still drive.\n\nFuck cars.",

After going into the pollution that comes from producing materials for cars, the inefficient use of space, and how no amount of technology could solve these problems, I explained what the benefits of public transportation and densification. He admitted that he'd never thought of it like that and it was a very convinced that there was not nearly as much value in EVs compared to a more developed transit sytem.\n\nAnd all this with someone who was a self-admitted car enthusiast.

Walkability and bikeability makes all the bitches bad af. I swear everyone in the whole city was in shape cuz they bike everywhere. Plus more hot girls walks is good for everyone\n2. The bike infrastructure was so good that even drunk you can get around on a bike safely. Getting to bars, clubs, parties and booty calls was a fun drunken bike ride. \n3. It's way cheaper. Uber rides gone, gas cost gone, expensive repairs gone and car payments gone. This means more money for booze, weed, gamblin and throwin bangers with the boys\n\nThis movement should be looking for support from every corner. The frat-boy's of today will be the Brett Kavanaugh's and George Bush's of the future wielding great power.

      "title": "I did it. I sold my car.",
      "text": "I am in a very car-centric region, and honestly, it was and still is nerve-wracking to be car-free. But overall I am so glad and so proud. I\u0019m going to share the specifics of my story here just in case anyone is curious, or in case my methods/ money math/strategies might help anyone else who is considering making the switch. It is looooooong. I\u0019m writing it mostly for me, in the interest of navel gazing, but I\u0019d love to have you join me for a circle jerk!\n\n\u0014\u0014\n\n**background**\n\nIt was time to move, and I decided to pay more to live near a small transit center. It\u0019s an older suburban \u001cdowntown\u001d neighborhood, which means that almost everything is walking or biking distance, though it\u0019s not a bustling skyscraper \u001cdowntown\u001d area. There are lots of small businesses, everything from bougie breweries, to dentists\u0019 offices and coin-op laundromats. You know, businesses that RESIDENTS use; not just shit for tourists. There are TWO community theaters walking distance from my house. In other words, it\u0019s heaven on earth - at least as much as you can get around these parts.\n\nIt is definitely a slowly gentrifying \u001clower-income neighborhood.\u001d You\u0019ll see cars on the lawn and some houses overrun with weeds. And then one block down, you\u0019ll see the \u001cvillage,\u001d with the businesses I mentioned above. In between you\u0019ll see& everything in between.\n\nAnd I\u0019ll admit, I am an early gentrifier. There is no way around that truth. I hate it. On balance, I feel like my actions have more of a positive impact than negative, even just by virtue of being car-free. I fucking hope. But I wanted to throw that acknowledgement out there.\n\nI also think that the best way to have a positive impact is to deliberately patronize the long-standing small businesses in the area as much as possible. Not to avoid the newer cafes and whatnot, but to make sure that I\u0019m not giving them all my coins. That\u0019s a bit of a tangent, but it\u0019s important to me that I fight against what happened to my nearby hometown - so much rapid development catering entirely to tourism that there is nothing but AirBnBs and locals are forced out altogether. There are no more laundromats or accessible necessities in that downtown area anymore. Only hipster bars with $18 cocktails and $30 lunchables (\u001ccharcuterie\u001d)\n\nI will also admit that I made certain assumptions about the crime rate here. Looking at actual statistics, this place is significantly lower in crime than my old suburban hell neighborhood with abundant parking and HOAs to keep the weeds in check (the REAL problem /s). And this despite having higher population density, being near a transit center, and having several bars in the area. Still lower crime. Amazing.\n\nGee - maybe it\u0019s because people here know their neighbors and have a goddamn sense of COMMUNITY?? Who\u0019d have thunk it.\n\nFor example, there is a large and beautiful mural near me, which, based on the date next to the signature, was done 17 years ago. It depicts the history of the city and honors local small businesses and historical figures.  The paint is a bit faded, but it\u0019s still gorgeous. And here\u0019s the thing. There are plenty of little gangbangers and taggers around here, but nobody has touched that mural in 17 years. I get misty eyed every time I think about it.  Again, the power of actual community, which is stolen from us when everybody is in an ever-more-bloated metal box, with a Ring camera on their door, paranoidly lurking NextDoor rather than being outside and talking to their neighbors. You know, the way people are supposed to do.\n\n**The numbers**\n\nIn case you\u0019re curious, here\u0019s how the math maths (trigger warning; rent is fucking expensive around here):\n\n**Old rent: $1995**\n\n(my old landlord had not raised my rent since 2020, which means it was artificially LOW for this area, believe it or not.)\n\n**New rent: $2800**\n\n(I know. Yikes on bikes. For context, the next cheapest option I would have had for a 1 br would have been $2400 in suburban hell, with almost no transit, walkability, or bike lanes. Instead I have a 2br in the midst of everything for $400 more. I may be able to rent out the extra bedroom soon, but holy shit, everything in this 1975-built apartment is tiny. There is no garage, no broom closet, etc. so I would have to significantly downsize even beyond what I have already done. Most of the square footage challenge is my own goddamn fault with lifestyle creep; I know that. But on the other hand, I have to emphasize how impossible it is to get away form the extortion-levels of rent around here. The cheapest option I found when I was looking was a converted hotel room for $1650, and that was 45 miles away form my work. No chance to sell the car because public transit would be 2.5 -3 hours one way.)\n\nAnyway&\n\n**New transportation expenses: $60** for a monthly bus / train pass, plus electricity to charge my ebike, and probably more maintenance on the bike coming up soon.\n\n**MINUS the car expenses:**\n\n**Car note: $286**\n\n**Car insurance: $200**\n\n**Gas: \\~$150-200**\n\n**\\*\\*Conclusion: \\*\\*** Even before factoring in maintenance, registration, parking fees, car washes, etc., my total costs per month of housing + transportation comes out at maybe a $300 increase total.\n\nLooked at differently, if my old landlord had raised my rent 10% each year, (the maximum allowed in my state) I would be paying probably the exact same amount by now (in total housing + transportation) but I would be chained to that goddamn metal box, which would soon need expensive repairs.\n\nJust to point out, my car payment and insurance were pretty godddamn low, even for what they are. This was for a 2019 Sentra which I bought used at the end of 2019.) So, this huge savings would be even bigger for a lot of people.)\n\n**Now for the intangibles (positive first)**\n\nI walk around sometimes floating on air, thinking to myself, \u001cwow! I live in a real place! I live in a NEIGHBORHOOD!!\u001d I have a favorite brewery and other 3rd places around here. So even if I don\u0019t go in, I can still wave hello at the owners and employees as I pass. Did I die and go to a heaven built by Mr. Rogers??\n\nYesterday morning I woke up and realized I was lower on groceries than I thought. So I thought, \u001cI\u0019ll walk the dog and then figure out breakfast.\u001d As I was walking her, I realized I was actually really fucking hungry. But guess what. There is a pub a block away from me that has dog-friendly patio seating, is open for breakfast, and takes Apple Pay (so even though I didn\u0019t bring my wallet, I could pick something up.). That means that while walking my dog, I was able to make the impromptu decision to pick up breakfast to-go without even having to go home for my wallet or to drop her off or to get in the car to drive somewhere. Can you imagine?? Six months ago, I could not have.\n\nI talk to people, every day. Living in suburban hell, I could easily go the day talking to nobody except my dog.  Or maybe a phone / zoom call.\n\nI\u0019m more outgoing in general. I an an introvert and a socially anxious person, but it\u0019s easier and easier every day to initiate a conversation with a stranger. It\u0019s incredible how huge the shift has been for me already, in such a short time. So, like& are my neuroses really a core part of my personality, or a learned cultural practice? (Car culture).  I shit you not, I feel like a deep-rooted part of my soul is healing.\n\nEvery time I walk or bike around, I discover something new that I never noticed before.\n\nI get to take the TRAIN. Do you understand?? I get to take the TRAIN!!! ALL THE TIME!!!  I am getting to know the conductors!! And I have my favorites - the guy who gave me a train safety pin because I am a huge fucking dork who can\u0019t hide my excitement; the trans woman who is a whiz at \u001ctetris-ing\u001d all of the bikes into the bicycle car.\n\nI love trains more and more every time I\u0019m on one. I\u0019ve been car-free for about 2 months, and I still get a thrill every time I hear the horn and see the train coming in the distance. I understand why people were excited enough about trains to write \u001cshe\u0019ll be comin\u0019 \u0018round the mountain when she comes.\u001d\n\nI use a buggy/trailer on my ebike to get groceries and it\u0019s the highlight of my week. I\u0019m a mile away from a major grocery store (actually, I have 3 or 4 major grocery stores within a 1 mile-ish radius, but this one is my preferred), so about once a week, I order my groceries for curbside pickup online. This is so much easier and faster than walking the aisles of the store, and I\u0019m less tempted by impulse purchases. I can literally shop from my couch, add things directly to my digital shopping cart throughout the week (instead of a list) and then checkout / set a pickup time when I\u0019m ready. And every single time the employee brings out the cart with my groceries, they say, \u001cis all of this going to fit in there?\u001d And every single time, I get to be a little smug about the fact that everything fit, with room to spare& \u001cwe didn\u0019t even have to use the saddlebags or the basket!\u001d I\u0019ll say with feigned surprise.\n\nI\u0019ve quickly gotten spoiled by this new method. Last time I had to actually walk the aisles of a grocery store, I was so annoyed. \u001cThis is taking forever / where is the goddamn bread aisle??! / what a fucking hassle / this is for the birds / how in the blue fuck did I live like this my whole life until now??\u001d\n\nAnd if I forgot eggs or whatever? Guess what - there are multiple small corner stores a short walk from my house. Ethically, I find these more appealing than shopping at the major chain grocery stores anyway.\n\nI thought I would need to factor increased costs for Uber/Lyft (It would still be worth it), but I think I am actually using ride sharing LESS often living here!\n\nIt absolutely blows my mind, after even a few short months, how strange I now find it to own a car. A friend of mine recently casually mentioned going to her favorite lash lady, 36 MILES AWAY, without blinking one of those beautifully be-lashed eyes. Thirty six goddamn miles?!?! That is a 4.5 hour bike ride, ma\u0019am. That is a full 24 hours of walking. How disconnected have we become from the very ground beneath our feet (or tires) that this is just normal? To casually drive your SUV 36 motherfucking MILES to get your eyelashes done??! Not to be a hypocrite - I have absolutely done things every bit as wasteful, if not worse, behind the wheel of a cage.\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n**Biking can be fucking scary.**  I\u0019m a pathologically non-confrontational person, but it\u0019s hilarious how instinctively I will go into immediate RAGE when a driver wrongs me, honks at me for taking the lane when it is necessary and perfectly legal, etc. I do NOT hesitate to scream profanities. And if I can catch up to you, you WILL get a lecture on CVC 21208 and CVC 21202. Ha.\n\nIn the past year (before I moved to this neighborhood, actually), I just so happened to eyewitness TWO DUI crashes in which the driver hopped one or more curbs. I know it\u0019s statistically just a wild coincidence, but good lord it\u0019s scary to think about as a cyclist / pedestrian.\n\n**Perception.**  Let\u0019s not pretend that any of us are impervious from caring what other people think. I fucking \\*hate\\* the look of pity from people when I \\*joyously\\* share the news that I\u0019ve sold my car.  But a few years ago, I would have reacted the same way. In car-dependent regions like this, there is a general assumption that you don\u0019t go car-free unless you are extremely poor, severely disabled, or you have multiple DUIs. Obviously, those are all marginalized / pitied / hated groups of people.\n\nIncidentally, my own carbrain father has been super critical. I am in my late 30s and fully financially independent, so it\u0019s none of his goddamn business, but he has characterized this decision as \u001cregressing,\u001d \u001cadolescent,\u001d \u001cdependent,\u001d and on and on and on. It's his way of expressing concern, which I understand, but I can\u0019t pretend it doesn\u0019t hurt.\n\n**Shit takes longer.** Not nearly as long as I though it would, but it does take longer to get around town. It means being more prepared in advance, being a bit more of a planner. This is all fine with me. But it\u0019s something to factor in.\n\n**The month of August.** Good god, it is so fucking HOT and HUMID right now. Thank god for the ebike. Even with the minimal effort and the breeze in my face, I am finding that I need to arrive to places at least 10 minutes early in time to cool down and stop sweating. Ugh. In general, I will have to be even more cognizant of, and prepared for, the weather. Let me just say that fortunately, I live in a place known for good weather. The reason for the rent being so high in the first place is the \u001csunshine tax.\u001d And isn\u0019t it ironic that this place, of all places, should be so car dependent? If you made it this far, fuck it, it\u0019s Southern California. You could probably figure that out if you stalked my profile anyway.\n\n**My doggy.** She is a 65 pound senior. There is a groomer a block away, but I am very attached to her old vet, a good 5 miles from here. We also visit my parents fairly often, who are close by. I bought the bike buggy/stroller specifically for her, but she is slow to warm up to it, and I can\u0019t blame her. I\u0019m not even sure I like the idea of her being in it on these bumpy-ass roads. That means getting a ride (being \u001cdependent;\u001d thanks for the verbiage, pops) or an Uber Pet (highway robbery). What I\u0019m trying to say is that even though getting myself around is pretty easy, getting \\*her\\* around town is a challenge. 100% worth it, and one day pretty soon I\u0019m going to be devastated to no longer have that challenge. Just saying. I wish I could take her on the train. I\u0019ve considered registering her as an emotional support animal, and it\u0019s caused me to reevaluate my previous assumption that people who do that are assholes who delegitimize actual service animals. I mean, there\u0019s still SO much truth to that, but& it\u0019s complicated, I guess.\n\nThe whole thing is complicated. Overall I am so stoked on my decision and wanted to share it in this group of like-minded folks. If you made it this far, thanks for reading!! Feel free to AMA.\n\n\\*edit: formatting",

      "text": "I have had some version of this conversation with so many different people and always makes me laugh when I get pushback on this statement. I am pretty sure most folks have no idea how much their cars cost them. \n\nI just tell them to do the math and everyone of them has a hard time stomaching that if anything $500 is often low. My math :)\n\n* Average gallon of gas: $3.50 (I live in California so this is low for us high for others, but over 10 years probably reasonable)\n* Annual Mileage: 10k miles\n* Average MPG: 30 miles\n* Annual cost of insurance: $1k\n* One time purchase cost: $20k\n\nMaking a couple assumptions that you keep the car for 10 years (longer than many do), that the cost of maintenance is about the same as what you spend on gas (I heard this is a good general estimate of maintenance costs), and you do not pay any interest on the purchase:\n\n* Cost of fuel is: (($3.50 per gallon * 10,000 miles)/ 30 MPG) * 10 years = ~$11.6K\n* Maintenance cost: $11.6k\n* Insurance: $1,000 * 10 years = $10,000\n* Purchase cost: $20,000\n\n* The total 10 year cost : $10k + $11.6k + $11.6k + $20k = $53k\n* Annual cost : $53k / 10 years = $5.3K / year\n* Monthly cost : $5.3k / 12 months = ~$450 / month\n\nSo a bit lower than $500 but these are conservative estimates and most of the folks I have this debate with keep their car for 5 years, pay interest on their purchase, pay way more than $20k for the car, and pay more than $1k per year for insurance.",

Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/americans-are-willing-to-pay-177-annually-for-carbon-tax-survey-finds). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the \"rich\" can afford fossil fuels in the first place. We [won\u0019t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224); the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).\n\nJust [eight years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20140723120752/http://closup.umich.edu/issues-in-energy-and-environmental-policy/13/public-views-on-a-carbon-tax-depend-on-the-proposed-use-of-revenue/), only 30% of the public supported a carbon tax. Four years ago, [it was over half (53%)](https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx).

According to NASA climatologist and climate activist [Dr. James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen), becoming an [active volunteer with Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://cclusa.org/x) is [the most important thing you can do for climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8). Climatologist [Dr. Michael Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Mann) calls its [Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend) policy [an example of the sort of visionary policy that's needed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/). And [**having more volunteers helps**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizensClimateLobby/comments/tonz9h/districts_with_more_ccl_volunteers_have_more/).\n\n[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is *necessary* if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with \"high confidence\" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf). It is literally [Econ 101](http://sites.bu.edu/manove-ec101/files/2014/10/EC101Outlines14-Externalities.pdf). The idea [won a Nobel Prize](http://environment.yale.edu/news/article/william-nordhaus-wins-nobel-prize-for-economics-of-climate-change/).

      "text": "I stopped driving a year before the pandemic, ever since I got into a car accident. As a full-time worker and college student back then, who lives in LA county and was attending school in Los Angeles, I was first distraught as I became used to depending on my car. The freedom of a set of wheels was indeed invigorating, but it came with a terrifying sense of road range for me, I always arrived home more angry. Los Angeles drivers are some of the shittiest drivers and people in the world, I still have a thing against pickup trucks and priuses, even as a silent backseat driver.  However, as someone who has taken public transit and walked on foot for the majority of my own life, I eventually began to love the freedom of being on foot and public transportation again. I love that I can go anywhere I want by the own will of my feet, or without being financially trapped with obligations. I no longer had to pay for gas, insurance, and all the inconveniences that come with cars. I no longer wait in traffic at all, as I calmly ride a train or a subway at ease while others are trapped and stuck in disgusting traffic. I happily watch them all suffer as I calmly breeze by them in my public transit. \n\nMy partner and my mom always try to tell me how something bad can happen on public transportation. To me, I honestly just think they're both a bit stupid when they try to come at me with this 2d flat logic. ANYTHING \"BAD\" CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE AT ANYTIME, just the way the reality is. When I drove on the freeway, I always saw countless cars that were wrecked to a pulp, sometimes even with dead passengers. Why do people suddenly become blind when they have a subjective perspective?  \n\nI know that both my mom and my partner view me as less than for having a car in some way, and both are always trying to tell me to drive. I just freaking hate it, it always makes me feel trapped, especially when there is no real need for me to drive. They don't, and won't, understand how deeply beneficial it is for me to not drive.

      "text": "The suv sucks. I bought one last year, because my car died, and I needed a vehicle on the cheap - because well, without one, getting to work is impossible. \n\nI hate how the SUV gets lousy gas mileage like a small truck, with much less ability to do truck like stuff. \n\nI hate how SUVs are built on car platforms but with truck style bodies to make them have the ability to drive like a car, but sway like a school bus if you have to swerve out of the way. \n\nI hate how consumerist the SUV is! Look at all the shit you can haul!!! Like we didn\u0019t have vehicles that could hold all your shit before. \n\nI hate how they are basically pedestrian killers. They sit higher, they are loaded with screens to take your eyes off the road, and well, since they are heavier than a normal car, take more time to stop. \n\nI got into bike riding a year ago. Hardcore. Road, gravel, MTB - love it all. I enjoy traveling by bike. Being able to appreciate the world around me, feeling the wind, not being bound to a road. \n\nThe area in which I live is bound by roads. Poorly maintained roads that have also not at all kept up with the growth of the area. Driving absolutely sucks here. I hate doing it. Also, what are we mainly driving for? To go to work. To pay for the car that gets us to work. \n\nI\u0019m tired of hearing about how much taxes would go up to have competent public transportation. Are you seriously thinking it would be more than the weekly fueling up, the monthly insurance payment, the car payment, or if paid off, the inevitable service costs of maintaining a car? I think not.  Also, adequate public transportation would probably reduce road maintance costs, reduce our need for petroleum, give us a few more green spaces, multi use trails, and maybe a few less hours at work, because the expenses aren\u0019t so high. \n\nAnd the SUV is the perfect device to keep us plugging along, ignoring the whole problem they created. \n",

      "text": "I live alongside a stroad in an otherwise very pedestrian-oriented area (it was all I could afford), and I'm so damned sick of hearing kids with their muffler-deleted cars blasting through my area.  There are several of those flashing light pedestrian crossings along said stroad, and a park where kids regularly play and people hang out.  Tons of foot traffic.  And these idiots use it as a drag strip.  You can hear them slamming on the gas for a mile each direction.\n\nBeing obsessed with acceleration is a part of larger car culture that I don't think gets talked about enough.  Speed kills, and being able to get up to speed faster might feel safer to drivers since it allows them to merge into traffic more easily, but like most (often inaccurate) driver perceptions of enhancing their own safety, it puts pedestrians and people on bikes more at risk.  I don't *want* somebody at the stoplight where I'm crossing the street to be able to reach 60mph in 2.3 seconds.  I don't want that driver making a right turn to be able to lightly tap the pedal and get a big surge of speed.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I was always suspicious of Tesla even a decade ago before Elon Musk completed his mission to make himself look like a crazy idiot in front of the whole world.  As a brand, they've always been more concerned with including lots of distracting high-tech stuff in the cabin and with pushing the limits on acceleration than with helping the environment.\n\nMaybe instead of being in a constant arms race to have the biggest, fastest, heaviest vehicle, manufacturers should be including intelligent speed limiters that use GPS to cut acceleration and top speeds when driving on urban streets.  Except I know they'll never do this because it doesn't make them more money.  (So the government should pass regulations to *make* them do it.)",

      "text": "I'm 17, graduating high school next month, and have never had the desire to learn to drive. I ride my bike to school every day and mostly to everywhere else, and I'm extremely content with doing so. I'm going to community college right across the street from my high school, so my upcoming commute won't be any different in terms of distance. After I get my associates I plan on going to a university in western Europe, in an urban city where I will most likely not need to rely on a car either for my daily life. Already, that will be 5-6 years of not having an urgent or consistent need to drive a car. So based on my lifestyle and future plans, getting a drivers license is not really at the top of my list of priorities for the near future.\n\nMy family on the other hand, more so my older relatives, are very judgmental and think I'm being immature and childish. Because to them, driving a car = being an adult. Even though I am incredibly self-reliant and independent already without needing to drive a car. I do great in school, and I've never been rebellious or anything as a teen, so I'm honestly offended that my family is upset with me because of this. I am proud to be a bicyclist; to me it represents staying true to my values, beliefs, and passions.\n\nNot only do I actually enjoy riding my bike, but I honestly feel guilty every time I'm in a car. Because of the CO2 it emits as well as the overall city infrastructure that driving encourages, which is not very sustainable or even pleasant from my experience. I don't want to dedicate my time learning a skill that I don't want to learn, nor do I think I will use. My parents have also always struggled financially, so I honestly don't know why they want me to drive and spend more money on gas, etc.! Riding my bike costs nothing. \n\nI don't think I am being childish or immature. I think I am making a reasonable, mature, and individualistic decision for myself. Why is riding a bike instead of driving seen as less than? Do you think biking labels people? or brands them, like as people who are \"eco freaks\" or less wealthy, etc. Maybe that's why my family wants me to drive :/\n\n In my opinion, choosing to ride a bike when you have the opportunity to drive is a brave and bold decision, one that I respect.",

      "text": "I had a Chevy Colorado that I bought new in 2018. I\u0019ve worked remote that entire time, so most of the time we were using it to run up into the mountains on the weekends. Since we moved into our local city in western Washington last year, it\u0019s been spending more and more time parked in front of my house bc:\n\n- I hate sitting in traffic. \n- I hate trying to find parking downtown. \n- Gas has gotten wildly expensive. \n- My wife\u0019s CRV can handle the forest roads we use on the weekends just fine. \n\nA few months ago, I watched Not Just Bikes video on the scourge of American trucks, and it really hit home how costly and harmful they are. I looked at our budget, and between the payment, gas, maintenance, insurance, and annual state taxes we were putting away $800 a month for a vehicle that spent most of its time parked in front of the house! \n\nMy wife and I decided to do a trial run of parking the truck. The thought was to see how it would impact our life just to have one car. There was some concern that it would be difficult to navigate if one of the cars broke down, or we needed to haul something, etc. The result after 3 months? No noticeable difference to our lives whatsoever. If we need to haul something (a rarity) we can rent a truck for a day. If the car breaks down, there are rental options or rideshare options or friends with vehicles. \n\nSo, yesterday, we finally pulled the trigger and sold the truck to a local dealership that gave us a good price. Between the reduced car costs and using the proceeds to pay off other debts, it should free up $1250 a month in cash flow. Also, it\u0019s one less oversized vehicle on the road, at least in our household. Looking forward to continuing to use my bike to get around (and maybe getting an e-bike soon) and not having such a huge black hole in our budget. \n\nThanks for all the awareness this sub provides to issues around car dependency. It really does put some good out into the world.",

      "text": "After WW2, the federal government took hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money to build car centric infrastructure, the interstate and highway systems, and continues to take billions every year to repair and expand it. And yet, if you don\u0019t individually pay several private companies thousands of dollars to buy a car, maintain it, and get insurance for it, it is completely useless to you. They pretend WE didn\u0019t already pay for it. The way this country was built was purposely designed to funnel money to the auto industry, and they robbed us at gunpoint to do it.\n\nThis is what the government does with every major industry, it steals our money to give subsidies to private corporations, and then makes us pay for their products twice when we need them. And it ENSURES that we need them, because the world they built makes us reliant upon them. The pharmaceutical industry, oil and gas companies, power, water, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, housing, banking, tech, its all the same tactic. Just funneling your money into their friends pockets, who then generously donate to their re-election campaigns.\n\nPublic transportation is the obvious answer to so many of the problems we face as a nation and a planet, and yet the government will never willingly transition to it, because the auto industry pays them too much. When faced with a choice between what will help its citizens and what will help corporations, the government chooses corporations every time. Capitalism and democracy are fundamentally incompatible with each other, and in the US, capitalism has always held the real power.\n\nEdit: I\u0019ve been corrected in the comments about the origin of the Interstate system. To clarify, I\u0019m not arguing that highways are by themselves a bad thing, or began as a conspiracy to make people drive cars. I\u0019m sure the folks who designed them had the best of intentions. But its been 70 years since then, and many other countries have adapted and modernized, accommodating highways AND modern HSR, as well as robust local transit methods. Meanwhile the US has done nothing to match them, instead investing its hopes in EVs as the future, which will never be as energy or space efficient as public transit. The recent Inflation Bill will give car companies enormous sums of money to promote EV development, money which could have gone to solutions we know work. So I think my assessment of modern car-brain is accurate. The auto industry has become the new railroad industry of the 1800s, and bends the government to its will. In the next 10 years, YOU will be expected to buy an expensive electric car to \u001cdo your part\u001d, even though they were funded with your tax dollars.",

When I told him the parking at work costs $5 a day he said that he would never work there because he shouldn't have to pay to come to work (work subsidizes about 80% of our parking compared to the market rate).\n\nMy work is 1.5 miles from his apartment, he works 20 miles from his apartment. He literally pays more in gas for his SUV to get to his current job than it would cost to get to my work. When I suggested he could bike instead, he said he hated all the bikers in the city and didn't want to be one of them. This is in an area with amazing bike networks and knowing that I bike to work.\n\nWhen another friend pointed out that there is a bus stop right next to his apartment that he could take he said he wouldn't want to ride the bus like a poor person.\nSome car brains you can't fix no matter how easy a city makes it to not use a car.",

      "text": "It was a shit day at work today, so for a change of pace and because it is very hot in my apartment, I went for a bike ride through the city in the evening after it rained. Perhaps not the best idea with dusk appraching, but I got lights on my bike and I mostly stick to bicycle paths anyway.\n\nHowever, on the way back I got thirsty and stopped at a gas station to buy a bottle of water. The gas station is not directly at an intersection, but to get back to the bicycle path I need to turn left on a big one, at least a big one for here in austria. The intersection has five lanes: Two in each direction and a left-turning lane in each direction that face each other.\n\nSo I am sitting on my bike in the left turn lane, waiting for my signal. I advanced to the middle of the road as we are taught so I don't see my actual traffic light anymore, as I am supposed to turn when the oncoming traffic halts (or there isn't any). What I can see is the pedestrian signal turning red. A car is in the left most lane coming toward me, but I can tell that it is slowing down, probably already seeing the green light blinking or the yellow on. He won't make it across.\n\nI think \"Okay, lane is free, then I can step on the pedals and get across\" and do just that.\n\nWhat I did not expect was that right behind the guy I saw, an absolute asshole swerves into the inner lane, opens the throttle so that he can get across the intersection on a yellow (if not red). What is actually on the intersection he does not care about at all. He barely misses me, passing only inches behind me. If I had delayed my movement for half a second I would have been his new hood ornament. And I almost die of a heart attack anyway.\n\nAnd all that for a single fucking red phase at the intersection.",

I move next to the building for what safety I could get. He starts screaming at me, daring me touch his truck again. At this point another guy walked over and interceded on my behalf.

Shouldn't the target of our anger be car manufacturers, oil and gas companies, and government rather than just your average car user? They are the powerful entities that design our world in such a way that makes it hard to use other methods of transportation other than cars. Shaming/mocking/attacking your average individual who uses cars feels counterproductive to getting more people on our side and building a grassroots movement to bring about the change we want to see.\n\nEdit: I just wanna clarify, I'm not advocating for people to be \"nicer\" or whatever on this sub and I feel like a lot of focus in the comments has been on that.

I want to sum up the responses here and give my takes on how I think we can do better.\n\n# Our messaging is pretty good, actually\n\nMost people said we have decent messaging. Most top posts in this sub point out real problems with current infrastructure. The focus is systemic, not individual (mostly). The FAQ does a great job of explaining the purpose of the sub.\n\n**The sub name is divisive but ultimately a good thing**\n\nYeah it's negative, yeah it's anti-car. Yeah it pushes away some people. But it attracted a lot more people than it repulsed. It made people curious. Other urbanist subs with more palatable names have been far less successful.\n\n**Most of the detractors haven't read past the name**\n\nUnfortunately, having a divisive name has pushed away some people. These are people who probably would have never gotten on board, though. If you aren't willing to read 2 more sentences about what a sub is about, you're probably a lost cause!\n\n# Things we could improve\n\n**We need to avoid any hint of hating individuals living in the system**\n\nThis is a controversial point, but I'm pretty firmly convinced by now. We need to be crystal clear in this sub that we are about hating *car-centric design,* hating *cars* to some degree (although some of us may enjoy them as hobbies) and being pro walkability and transit.\n\nWe do not hate *drivers!* Most people depend on driving because of the system.\n\nTherefore we need to purge any language that sounds like we hate the victims of a car-infested world.\n\n**Stop using pejoratives**\n\nPejoratives create division. They create an us-vs-them dynamic. You should only call someone names if you have zero intention of changing their mind. Politicians, public figures, and bad-faith individuals who have made it their life mission to wreak havoc are fair game to ridicule. But it should always be crystal clear *who* you are insulting and exactly why.\n\n\"Nazis are assholes\" is fine, because you should have no intention of ever collaborating with nazis.\n\n\"NIMBYs are assholes\" isn't a good idea because a lot of NIMBYs are simply misguided and could have their minds changed. You want NIMBYs to listen to you, not disregard you.\n\n**Stop saying \"Carbrain\"**\n\nThis is my unpopular opinion. Feel free to change my mind. But I'm pretty confident that this word is hurting our cause.\n\nIt's a pejorative for people who can't see the harm of car-centric design. There are many problems with this language\n\n1. It's not clear what it means or who it refers to. At first glance, it seems to be referring to anyone who drives a car. This would be victim blaming because most drivers are coerced into driving.\n2. Even after finding out that it refers to people who support car-centric infrastructure, the very fact that it's a pejorative term means it will drive away people who disagree with you. I would like to draw more people to the cause, not drive them away.\n3. Many \"car-brains\" are simply people who haven't realized the harm of car-centricity or even realized that alternatives are possible. Many of these people aren't far from being convinced! Starting off by insulting them will ruin your chance.\n\nAs I said, please change my mind.\n\n**Stop calling people \"cagers\"**\n\nThis has all the problems of \"car-brain\" times 2. It literally sounds like a slur.\n\n**Generally avoid \"us vs. them\" language, even when talking about people who support car-based infrastructure**\n\nStop using language that defaults to assuming all opposition is extremist, that all opposition is set in their ways, that they are all mean, stupid, etc. Use language that recognizes different people as being points on a spectrum.\n\nSome people hate you for what you believe. Others simply think you're misguided. Others agree to some extent, but think you're extreme. And others think you're not extreme enough! Get used to thinking of people as complex, even people who work against your most passionate causes.\n\n**People will be confrontational -- but you don't have to be**\n\nThis sub has a great name. It invokes a lot of emotions and gets people interested. But it also gets people riled up from the start. Be ready for people to come at you swinging.\n\nYou don't need to swing back. Ask them why they're angry, ask them what they want. You'll likely find they agree with you more than they realize -- point this out!\n\n**Stop saying \"orange-pilled\"**\n\nIt's cringe, it sounds too much like \"red-pilled\" or \"black-pilled.\" It also is [related to bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-orange-pill-theory-reality) for some reason. What's another term we can use for \"I can't unsee how cars cover everything and take up so much space in the world around me\"?\n\n# The future is bright -- go talk to your city council\n\nWe are at our best when we focus on activism. The memes are great and they get us motivated. Now go out and vote! Talk to your politicians! Touch grass!\n\nI think this movement has a real chance of making a difference. With gas prices spiking, millenials and Gen-Z running out of money, and a general feeling of loneliness and isolation in the internet age, I think the anti-car pro-walkability movement has a chance of working. It's been done in places around the world, and many cities even in the US are seeing real change.\n\nDon't be pessimistic.",

The new rates will be reduced to ¬15 for cars &lt;1000kg or Electric cars &lt;2200kg. The standard rate will be ¬30 and an increased rate of 45¬/mo. for gas engined cars &gt;1750kg, electric vehicles &gt;2200kg.

      "text": "Just as an example of how fucked American public transit is, it costs me $18.20 to take transit ($6 each way commuter rail fare plus $3.10 each way subway fare). Meanwhile, to drive, it costs me $6.90 - I get roughly 29 mpg in my car, it's 20.5 miles each way so 41 miles round trip and my local gas station right now is $4.88 per gallon.\n\nOn top of that, even when there's traffic it takes me 45 minutes to drive to work, compared to around  1hr45 minutes by transit; I have to transfer twice and subway service is so infrequent (every 15 to 20 minutes even during rush hour) that I often wait upwards of 10 minutes on each transfer.\n\nJust to show how utterly rotten to the core our transportation policies and priorities are. And I live in a major US city that's somehow touted as one of the more transit-friendly places to live.  \n\n\nEDIT: Sincerely thank you to everyone pointing out I'm not taking into account things like insurance or maintenance costs, or even the social cost of greenhouse gasses. However, I think my main point is that when confronted by the choice of an upfront cost of $7 versus the upfront cost of $18, most people are going with the cheaper one. \n\nWe should live in a world where driving a car costs far more than transit, even without factoring in long-term or \"hidden\" costs, but sadly my country does not think that way, and the simple disparity of transit fare versus cost of gas (even when gas prices are nearing record highs for the US) shows how utterly fucked things are here.",

      "text": "From **Quartz**: [Trump's running mate J.D. Vance wants tax rebates for gas cars instead of EVs](https://qz.com/jd-vance-trump-gas-car-rebates-evs-1851594703)\n\n&gt;*As recently as 2020 Vance was seen praising solar energy and begged for a \u001cclean energy future\u001d to cure the \u001cclimate problem in our society.\u001d When it became clear to him that he\u0019d need Donald Trump\u0019s endorsement to win the Ohio senate race, he began a dramatic shift his positions on climate denialism and fossil fuels. This bill proved to Trump that Vance would kiss the ring in exchange for power, killing the old Vance to grow a new one in his image.*\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*The Drive American Act seeks to gut the Biden administration\u0019s electric vehicle tax rebate program, with the first half of the bill undoing the program altogether. In the latter half of the bill, Vance proposes that American taxpayers follow him into a ridiculously circular logic that would instead place up to a $7,500 rebate on all new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, trucks, and SUVs. Vehicles with larger payloads and more seats would be eligible for more of the incentive. In order to take advantage of this, you\u0019d need to live in a household making less than $300,000, and the vehicle could not exceed $80,00o. Both \u001climits\u001d are well north of average.* ",

      "text": "Not sure if this has been posted yet.. couldn't find it anyways - but we got featured in Carbrain monthly! Be sure to check out the comments section for some great nuanced takes from the car persons. (/s)\n\n[https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/an-anti-car-movement-is-brewing-in-the-us-188433.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you imagine your life without a car or a truck? Do you see yourself biking to work or taking the bus every single day? Are you ready to carry groceries and supplies like in the old days? Well, this is what some people are dreaming of. We\u0019re not talking about 100, 1,000, or 10,000 people. No, there are over 217,000 supporters of the anti-car movement! It\u0019s worth understanding what they want, since these ideas tend to spread like wildfire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to a subreddit that has a very explicit name, people that are in favor of banning cars are not looking to make emergency vehicles disappear, they don\u0019t want to disrupt the supply chains dependent on trucks, and don\u0019t look at rural communities to make their plan happen. They also underline that the initiative isn\u0019t political and doesn\u0019t adhere to any set of \u001cleft\u001d or \u001cright\u001d values and beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What these guys and gals wish is to make everyone aware of the cost that we must all support because cars became so important for almost anything we do. This is clearer now that we\u0019ve all gradually returned to normal office hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-car community essentially agrees that building the roads and the needed utilities creates \u001can unwanted economic burden on communities\u001d that has proven to be costly everywhere, especially when you look at the yearly amount of dollars spent on maintenance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they say this won\u0019t stop with the switch to all-electric and self-driving cars, since charging and moving around without human control will almost certainly guarantee the number of vehicles won\u0019t come down, and more money will be needed for charging and resting spots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Not enough room for everyone**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People also think cities give too much space to cars, parking, and gas or charging stations. They want more parks, schools, homes, and businesses instead of vehicles in populated urban areas. Anti-car supporters also argue that making more space for cars creates induced demand, which translates into more cars everywhere if roads are widened and parking spots are created.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These online activists also underline that not everyone can simply buy and drive a vehicle. They say children, teenagers, impoverished parents and adults, and those unable to drive suffer a lot in \u001ccar-centric cities.\u001d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anti-car movement supporters also argue motor vehicles are dangerous. Occupants may benefit from increased levels of protection as automotive technology evolves and companies create new materials that are lighter, stronger, yet dissipate impact energy in a very efficient way, but those that are not in a car might not survive an impact with one \u0013 something that everybody knows since childhood. But these people insist exercising any *\u001cform of car-free liberty\u001d* is automatically linked to constant threat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They also say cars are nurturing isolation, since people don\u0019t meet so often to have a chat on a sidewalk. You may be inclined to bring up car communities and events, but keep in mind activists are only referring to city life. Urban dwellers might enjoy some more space for weekend activities or just walk to and from work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A change must happen, but not like this**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, the idea to ban cars remains a discussion on [a popular forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/). But the number of people that agree with this idea is frightening. It\u0019s impossible to have a car-less society. After all, people would still crash even if they rode bicycles or scooters. Removing cars may not change much, but giving up on fossil fuels and designing better cities might just do the trick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A change is clearly needed, but it can\u0019t happen without motor vehicles. They are an integral part of the U.S. (and the world) and of a major industry, while some certain models create entire communities, and even inspire.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All in all, banning cars from public roads and crowded cities might be applicable in specific cases or in some locations, but the U.S. is not ready in any way, shape, or form to give up entirely on motor vehicles. New York City is already struggling with keeping traffic under control after they\u0019ve made more space for bicycles and buses. People have various needs when it comes to reaching different destinations, and we can\u0019t take the comfort of knowing they can go everywhere they need at any given time without offering a public infrastructure that\u0019s working continuously and without delays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those that support the anti-car movement should be happy with switching from an internal combustion engine to an all-electric vehicle, be it a battery-electric or a fuel-cell (hydrogen) one.",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That\u0019s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.\u001d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/air-pollution-in-nsw-causes-603-premature-deaths-and-costs-48bn-a-year-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\n**The NSW Clean Air Strategy 2021-2030**\n\n\nDoes address cars and trucks with:\n\n*Zero Emissions Bus Transition Strategy* to transition to electric battery buses and hydrogen fuel cell technology. \n\n*Walking and Cycling Program*  to create cycling and walking connections/parths around Sydney.\n\n *NSW Electric Vehicle Strategy* to increase electric vehicle use through government rebates and building charges.",

      "text": "I grew up in the hood, until I was 13. My parents got better union jobs and bought a house in a middle class suburban neighbourhood. They also bought two cars, because our new neighbourhood is a car dependent shit hole. I hate it here. Everyone\u0019s old and there\u0019s literally nothing to do. If I want to meet my old friends, I have to drive them back and forth which is a pain in the ass. Back there I can meet my buddies after school at the local diner or park, if we needed any snacks or whatever the corner store was just a minute walk away. The commercial building in my new place is over a 20 minute walk and it\u0019s a shitty gas station. Is this what \u001ceconomic mobility\u001d means in North America? Because I hate it. Rather live in the hood and \u001cstruggle\u001d than be a slave to the system. I still resent my parents for that. ",

Nobody really knows.\u001d The former US president added that rising sea levels, caused by melting glaciers, would have the benefit of creating \u001cmore oceanfront property\u001d.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk, meanwhile, said it was wrong to \u001cvilify\u001d the oil and gas industry, the key driver of planet-heating pollution, and that the only imperative to ditch fossil fuels was that they will one day run dry.\n\n&gt;\u001cIf we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,\u001d said Musk, who is also chief executive of the electric car company Tesla. \u001cWe do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;\u001cWe still have quite a bit of time & we don\u0019t need to rush and we don\u0019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that. Like, leave the farmers alone.\u001d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk said the main danger of allowing carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere was that at some point it will become difficult to breathe, causing \u001cheadaches and nausea\u001d to people. This would occur with CO2 at about 1,000 parts per million of the Earth\u0019s atmosphere, more than double the current record-breaking concentrations.\n\nTo be clear, this is a problem soon because we're talking about indoor air which needs to be replaced with outdoor air. The higher outdoor CO2 concentration makes that process more difficult. We don't have to wait until the atmospheric levels are 1000 ppm https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000237 \n\nI think this pretty much confirms what we've been saying for years:  electric cars are here to save the car industry, not the planet. \n\n",

A few reasons:\n- bending over to put the car seat in will hurt your back (I'm short - reaching and climbing into a tall car isn't exactly comfortable either) \n- it's safer (not if it has blind spots the size of a small country)\n- it'll fit all the gear better (maybe legit, idk but I need to figure that out on my own. I'd rather carry less gear anyways) \n\nI've told people that I'm saving up for an electric car, but apparently that's unsafe because \"what if the baby needs to go to the hospital and there's a power outage and the car battery is dead?\" Like omg, that's not going to happen all at once. \n\nI guess everyone is just really, really anxious about kids, and buying things that are marketed as \"safe\" can be soothing. I wish that our carbrained society didn't have this fixation - babies are expensive and wasteful enough without requiring a $40k gas guzzling carriage.\n\nInfo: I'm in Canada.

Because I wanted to tell you that the country could be out of gas for cars after next weekend (if they're still striking). It means that people will be unable to use their cars if they're not electric, airlines in Iceland would shut down next weekend (if still striking) but it would have some big consequences for the people here, like lack of products in every store (including food) because Iceland is so car-dependent. This also means that public transit (which is almost all based on gas) could also shut down and it might cause that a lot of people will be unable to get to work (unable to drive and possibly taking public transit).

      "text": "Car centric infrastructure robbed me of my young adulthood.\n\nI couldn\u0019t afford my own personal vehicle until last year. Living in the suburbs, this means even a trip to the local café necessities driving, which in my case meant either asking my mom for a ride, begging her to let me use her car (unlikely, technically illegal for me to drive alone until I got my license in 2021; yeah, we couldn\u0019t afford adding a young man to the insurance plan until then), calling an Uber or taxi (expensive), or braving the walk half without sidewalks and surrounded by 40 mph traffic (downright deadly). She was usually happy to give me a ride wherever, but it still made mobility more complicated and tedious, and gas money was always a concern. Dating under those circumstances is especially awkward. \n\nFriends with cars were usually understanding and happy to give me a ride, but those friends themselves were few, because opportunities to meet people are slim when you\u0019re homeschooled your entire youth, can\u0019t afford college, and the only event your town holds is the fucking Police Officer\u0019s National Night Out (fuck that, ACAB). Meeting local friends through work was basically my only option, and that\u0019s a touchy environment to truly make connections. Still made a precious few though, who I love dearly.\n\nMy point? Car centrism is a prison to the poor. Practically speaking, I was locked inside my own neighborhood as far as my own power of locomotion was concerned, all for the obscene risk of becoming roadkill if I ventured further by foot. I know 2 people in my town who were struck by vehicles while walking. 1 was a 12 year old getting off the school bus, the other a 60 year old simply out getting exercise. The 12 year old\u0019s family is still in medical debt, and the 60 year old was basically scalped by the car that hit him. Both are still alive and doing well now, thank god. But they live with the scars, and the financial burden. Car centrism is anti-life.",

      "title": "Noise Pollution Hurting Health - Solutions",
      "text": "*I wanted to write a post on a serious issue that's been affecting my health and quality of life and see what can be done to stop this car related issue. I feel that listing as much as I know, acknowledging the problem, and posting it here could help do something more. Apologies in advance for the length:*\n\nSince the pandemic took effect, **extreme noise pollution** from modified mufflers and car subwoofers, which can be heard blocks away, have been affecting our ability to live altogether. It is constant. Literally at every stop light, at every hour, regardless of holiday or season. You can argue that living on a main street in Chicago has drawbacks, or that there is always that one loud car that drives around during the Summer, but this is not that. Our walls and floors are vibrating constantly from the ultrasonic waves emitted by these souped-up cars, and there are literally hundreds of them post-lockdown, which are going un-ticketed and unwarned. No amount of sound-proofing stops something you can hear blocks away. I do not have noise sensitivity, nor have I ever complained about such a thing until this started in 2021, and we've lived at the same residence on a major street for decades.\n\nPersonally, this has been a nightmare. We've undergone several deaths in our family, and we cannot even have the peace necessary to mourn those losses, because that is how loud and pervasive these disturbances are. Little thought goes by that is unrelated to this issue. There is now no difference between our house and the street. And this has sustained itself for 2 years. I now have tinnitus (ear ringing), and heart palpitations, as a result. The disturbances are loud enough to create momentary panic, and constantly enough, it causes hypertension and heart problems, and a change in the brain's chemistry. It feels as though you have lost your home.\n\nI've gone through every proactive process I can think of to stop it: speaking to police at 'CAPS' program beat meetings, speaking to our alderman, contacting neighborhood associations for help, even making a door to door petition. (Requesting a noise sensitive zone to be made: for signs to be posted warning these drivers of the fines already in Chicago law). I even contacted the EPA and wrote to the US secretary of transportation, inquiring about very simplistic processes that could be put in place to curb this problem.\n\n**What I have learned:**\n\n\t***Lockdown during the pandemic*** enabled many of these drivers, all over the country, the time and funds to modify their vehicles to this extreme. The pandemic fueled impatience, fear, volatility, immaturity, and the decline for many processes and standards that have not resolved, and this issue is the result of it.\n\n\t***Effects on the car industry*** enabled many car manufacturers to produce and market illegally louder and more aggressive vehicles. Manufacturers underwent heavy demand that couldn't be met during the pandemic, resulting in the further sales of alternate vehicles and the push for them. Marketing teams, to stimulate the car market, willingly created this public health problem for a profit. Companies such as Dodge and Ford have been manufacturing towering Pickup trucks that are literally as loud as semi-truck engines, mustangs and chargers that shake the ground while idling, all to draw attention from buyers. More and more vehicles are being created by stock to be louder, and it has even been speculated that acoustic engineers have been employed by some manufacturers to artificially amplify, through the cars stereo system, fake engine noises. You can occasionally see an older, unmodified sports car or motorcycle on the road that is nowhere near as loud. New advertisements have accentuated aggressive driving with amplified engine sounds in their media campaigns to push this agenda, which in turn has helped to enable a huge wave of dangerous driving under these conditions.\n\n\t***Law enforcement*** has become de-incentivized from performing traffic stops or virtually any traffic enforcement on city streets or highways in many states. Speaking personally to police sergeants, they have said that the volatility is higher, and the risks are greater for violent altercations, for when they do a traffic stop, and that they are discouraged from creating a negative encounter with a driver,  if it is not perceived as absolutely necessary, which leads to this excessive result. Non-pursuit policies are even in place for vehicles that do not pull over. Officers have also attested that they are extremely short staffed, as over 1000 officers had either been fired or retired since the pandemic began in Chicago. Remaining officers are told to prioritize calls by level of severity, and they are not likely to re-engage or check on past calls after they have departed the scene. Further, the tactic of a visual presence, which is used to encourage drivers to \"self-police\", under fear of being ticketed, is no longer being utilized as a strategy. And officers are not responding to these types of disturbances, unless called directly. But of course, the excuse stands, that once they do respond, the violator is already gone. They further entice that you record the violating vehicles plate number, and report them. But safely? Without being noticed? And hundreds of vehicles? OEMC has stated that officers will not be sent out to stand by and wait for a vehicle to commit an offense, despite the fact that this issue is so constant, it would take minutes to locate a car in violation. Officers also use the excuse that they will need decibel meters, which is false, in accordance with Chicago law, which states that any noise disturbance from a vehicle, plainly audible by an officer from a 100 foot distance, is viable for a $300 fine upon first offense, to be followed with $500, and then $1000 or impoundment. And, this fine was increased in 2022, through the efforts of several alderman, to $5000 for motorcycles bearing illegal mufflers. But without law enforcement, the laws are pointless.\n\n**This has become nationwide Post-Pandemic:**\n\nThis activity is linked directly to the uptick in dangerous driving that I am sure many people have noticed post-pandemic. I have been to 7 states in urban, suburban, and rural settings since this started, and it is now pervasive in all of them (CO, NY, PA, OH, IN, IL, WI). When compared to the previous year, traffic fatalities nationwide jumped by 7 percent in 2020 and 10.5 percent in 2021, hitting a 20-year high. There have even been multiple news segments about the drag racing and drifting events that would take over downtown areas with little enforcement to stop them. In 2021 convoys of hundreds of modified motorcycles invaded downtown NYC &amp; Chicago, running up on the sidewalks and even hitting a pedestrian, many without any license plates, and none were ever pulled over or stopped, but simply tailed by police until they dispersed on their own accord, miles away. (NY state even passed the SLEEP Act as a result of this issue in 2022, trying to regulate the sale of illegal mufflers and car audio equipment. NJ passed similar legislation, watered down however. NYC even instituted paying the public $100 rewards for tips leading to the impoundment and destruction of illegal motorcycles. Connecticut State Government passed a bill regarding illegal mufflers being tested during regular vehicle emission testing sites in 2022. NYC, Miami, Knoxville, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and many other cities have had news articles and passed stricter laws within the last 2 years. Though many of these efforts are in their infancy)\n\n***Solutions***:\n\n**Emissions Testing to Include Decibel Level Testing**\n\nA significant solution, is to institute decibel testing at Emissions Testing Centers. This would be a more immediate and simplistic course of action, in place of lacking law enforcement. These measures would include briefly searching for amplified audio equipment within a vehicle, while also measuring the noise emitted by a car's muffler through a decibel reader. This measure is simplistic and will save the health of thousands, while preemptively screening for and mandating the removal of these illegal audio systems and mufflers designed to disrupt others and civil order.\n\n**Funding O.N.A.C. for the E.P.A. / Developing further guidelines**\n\nReestablishing the Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The reestablishment of ONAC, a sector of the Environmental Protection Agency dissolved by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, would be the most concrete course of action. This branch was set to regulate noise pollution through air pollution. From what I've personally been told by the EPA, there hasn't been legislation on noise pollution since the 1970's, which was emphatic of airports alone, and that hadn't branched out far at all into controlling the complex reach of this issue. And now it is severe enough on a traffic level, post-pandemic, to where it should be considered.\n\n**Regulations On Sales of Illegal Car Parts and Audio Equipment**\n\nThese car parts that are used to augment vehicles are legal to sell, but illegal to install and use in this capacity. Major retailers such as Sam's Club and Walmart, sell subwoofers for cars to the general public for as low as $40. The nature of these parts alone are intended to be disruptive and their use is illegal in many states and cities, but the ownership is not. There is no other reason for these specific mufflers and subwoofers to exist other than to amplify noise that extends beyond an acceptable or conversational level. Laws on a state or federal level that regulate or prohibit the promotions and sales of these specific modifications by car manufacturers and auto shops to private individuals would help to end the expansion of this problem. It makes little sense that what is widely disruptive and illegal to use, is still permissible to market and sell.\n\n**Funding and promoting the availability of Noise Ticketing Cameras:**\n\n*The most likely solution*: development of Sound Ticketing Cameras has already been employed and used successfully by NYC, and is in the trial phase of being used in Washinton DC, Miami, and Knoxville, among other cities. This was through a special project by the NYC DEP. Many major cities and states have little awareness of these tools and some elect not to use them due to expense or a perception that the matter is not worth pursuing. But the development of these cameras is necessary in that they replace the need for police traffic stops, while protecting the community from dangerous driving, and insane quality of life and health issues. The cameras operate by issuing a ticket, the same as a speed camera, and a letter is sent to the offender requiring that they either pay a fine or come to a location determined by the EPA branch of the locality to have their equipment tested and removed in place of a fine. NYC has already recorded 70+ successful instances of this and has moved from a trial phase to using multiple cameras which are moveable. The drivers were instructed to visit the site of a sewage treatment plant for the testing. However these cameras are privatized and costly, at $36,000 each. Yet, they are all transportable units that can be switched around to different intersections to spread their efficacy. Several sound camera companies exist, but many cities are using one instituted in the UK, called SoundVue (Formerly Intelligent Instruments) as a direct result of noise levels rising after the pandemic. I've spoken directly to the founder of the company on this issue. City and statewide use or even knowledge of this vital tools are growing, but many are still unaware. Chicago for example, is either unaware or not yet enticed to use this technology, and it is a fight just to be heard on issues such as this, especially with the excuse that there are more pressing crimes and the ignorance that these lower crimes don't foster an environment for worse ones to take place. Something like this would help thousands, procure substantive revenue for local communities, and protect the lives of people who undergo traffic stops. No one likes the idea of traffic cameras, nor do I, but when you've lost your peace, your enjoyment of the little parts of life itself, and can find no place to avoid such a problem, you may come to similar thoughts too.\n\nI feel like the only way to stop this is if enough people collectively complain to an official while providing solutions, substantiating the issue and its impact.  I tried to do that with signatures, I gave up with the follow through, fearing it would make my health worse, and feeling hopeless that I alone could do anything. And yet my health is still degrading. There are people in power who are sympathetic and resourceful enough to consider these things, but its a hard search to find them in your area. A huge problem I have noticed is that many people who are bothered (Any normal person) give up on this, move away, or learn to eat it, and many more people who live on small side streets get enough reprieve to where they can easily ignore this new problem. Without this sole problem, I can't begin to tell you how different my life would be.",

      "title": "IMO, cars and Transit/Bicycle/Pedestrian infrastructure are mutually exclusive. If we want better transit and pedestrian infrastructure, we'll inevitably have to make driving less convenient/viable.",
      "text": "One aspect that is not talked about is that while we can improve transit and bicycle infrastructure all we want if we don't curve back and disincentivize car use, those efforts will be in vain because surprise surprise, many carbrained folks would never \"choose\" to take transit on their own accords and have to be compelled to use alternative modes of transportation. The thing is that, even if we build transit infrastructure, if there is still some appeal to driving, people will still choose to drive. That's why I believe that cars and transit are mutually exclusive. Coexistence isn't possible, either choose one or the other.\n\nFor example, why does transit suck in your area and the buses are always late? It's because of cars blocking the path! Why is cycling dangerous? It's because of cars! Why don't kids play outside? It's because of cars! Why is your area dead and soulless, seemingly devoid of life? It's because of cars!\n\nImprovements to transit infrastructure, and making a place more livable in general, come at the expense of \"convenience\" for cars. Want to make the buses run faster and on time? Give them a dedicated lane which means one less lane for cars. Want to make cycling safer? Give them their own pathway which can take away a lane from cars. Want to have kids play outside without the risk of getting mowed down, give them car-free areas.\n\nBut, without proper counter-measures, cars will always find a way in invade transit and bike only places. How many times of you seen a car blocking a bike lane? How many times of you seen cars with a single occupant using the HOV or bus only lane? Drivers are the most arrogant folks out there who are more than willing to break the rules (such as driving in the bus only lane). That is why we need proper enforcement on stuff like bike and bus only lanes to keep the automotive invaders out! \n\nTo improve transit and make our urban landscape more livable, we need a carrot-and-stick approach in regards to disincentivizing car use. The carrot can be very cheap if not free transit, high-freqency metro trains, safe bike lanes, etc. While the stick can be congesting pricing, less lanes for cars, high parking rates, or just outright ban cars from driving within a city, because screw the feelings of carbrain folks!\n\nImproving transit isn't just for personal preference and convenience, it's necessary if we want to mitigate harm done to the environment, as cars, both their direct and indirect effects, are one of the greatest threats to the natural environment.\n\nIn my opinion, coexistence between cars and transit isn't possible, as cars always find a way to sabotage transit. Car-centric design not only socially alienates people and makes ours lives miserable, cars are a direct threat to people, the environment, and the planet as a whole. If we want to have a habitable planet in the future, we must abandon the wasteful, harmful, and inefficient car-centric design in favor of transit oriented design which are almost always more efficient, sustainable, and better for our lives and natural world.",

      "text": "I'm a first-time poster here, though I've been lurking for some time, inspired by NJB and Climate Town. I'm a university professor at a rural (= conservative, low income area) university in the US, teaching an earth science course mainly taken by aspiring education majors who'll become elementary and middle school teachers. Many of them are female and of non-traditional age (late 20s/30s).\n\nFor my climate change module, I'm looking for videos or articles that clearly illuminate how the car dependent lifestyle that all of them lead is ruining the planet.\n\nAs you can safely imagine, most of my students have grown up shopping in big-box stores only know of car-dependent lifestyles. They have probably never traveled abroad, or even traveled much outside of their home state. And, as in so many places in the US like this, public transit is practically non-existent, as are bike lanes (Even I always drive because biking is too terrifying). The towns in the region only have sidewalks in the downtown core. Many students live in the country 20 or 50 km from town, on large plots of land (or some non-walkable subdivision). Driving 100 km in a day (or more!) running errands/commuting is completely normal. Each family member above 16 has a car. It is reasonable to assume that more than one of my students has a spouse or family member with a big truck, which they claim they need to haul crap or all their destructive toys around (dirt bikes, RVs etc.), get to work in the snow, or all the other carbrain excuses we know.\n\nAs part of the course, I have a discussion assignment on sustainability and energy use and what they can do to use less. Many students find it challenging to approach the topic, and you can tell they have many misconceptions. A lot of them are oblivious on how wasteful their single-family home lifestyle is and instead talk the industry mantra that a little recycling or switching off some lights is enough of a good deed. They may mention that the husband drives that big truck that uses so much gas, but he \u001cneeds\u001d it to get to work (and pay down the massive car loan which they can barely afford). They think that living out in the country makes them environmentally friendlier because of the big green lawn (that they mow with a riding gas mower every week).  Land is cheap so even poorer people live out in the middle of nowhere on a trailer on some tract of land.\n\nI'm looking for materials that can gently introduce (at least the more open-minded students) to the idea that this kind of lifestyle has significant environmental impacts and open their eyes to consider walkable communities for those students who may be relocating after graduation, advocate for better zoning and public transit, and challenge the notion that a big house with a big yard are the only \"proper\" way to raise a family, and perhaps plant that seed in some of the students who will also become future teachers.  Any recommendations on videos and articles would be appreciated. I am aware of the YouTube urbanist channels (NJB, CityNerd, Strong towns etc.) but I they might be too snarky/off-putting to that audience. So I would think it would be preferable to share with them something produced by a larger news organization/TV channel to make it look more official/impartial and avoid just talking about the Netherlands. Does such exist? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "**I\u0019m a product designer, and over the last year I've been working towards solving this issue: the inconvenience of doing grocery shopping without a car.**\n\n[This is the Milmo 1813](https://lemilmo.com).\n\nI come from a city that's been increasingly designing for car-independence and sustainability through plastic bag bans, and infrastucture re-design. The thing is, with all these changes, there still isn't a great solution for doing groceries without a car.\n\nI designed a this bag so that one can use it as their work bag, but also use it to comfortably pick up groceries on their way home via metro/subway/bus.\n\n**It was important to me to design a bag with an office-capable style that doesn't compromise on functionality. It does this through mainly one feature: a removable, washable, waterproof compartment liner.**\n\n[Groceries, and spillables go in the removable liner of the left, which connects to the inside of the outer \\(right\\) via snap buttons.](https://preview.redd.it/gc155j4ohz0c1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f35d3c8dc5e1636a0cc96507d2b3cbc51efd93b)\n\n**I love Montreal\u0019s metro system, but grocery shopping on it sucks.**\n\nI live in Montreal, home to one of the best cities in the world for urbanism and car-free living due to our medium-density development, a native 15-minute city design, high number of parks, and our robust and reliable Metro (We call the subway the metro here).\n\nThere is one thing though about commuting via public transport.\n\n**Doing grocery shopping on foot or by public transport sucks.**\n\n**My city banned the distribution of single-use shopping bags, forcing us to use annoying, cheap, ugly reusable grocery bags.**\n\n[The city of Montreal completely banned the sale and distribution of all plastic bags in fall 2022.](https://montreal.ca/en/articles/plastic-bags-what-you-need-to-know-about-legislation-20575) This means that everyone must now carry around a reusable grocery bag with them in their commutes, should they stumble upon the need for a grocery run. If not, they would have to buy one at the store which could cost anywhere from $0.50 cents cad to $2.00 cad.\n\nMade of cheap fabric, they\u0019re ugly, flimsy, and not very comfortable when walking/commuting over long distances to use since they can only be used handheld. Because of this, I don\u0019t always bring them around with me for example to work. Next thing you know I had a cupboard full of these ugly things.\n\nAnd then one day during a grocery run after work, refusing to buy another ugly bag, I decided to place my items in my work bag which had my laptop in it. The feeling of lettuce smushing up against the same fabric that housed my laptop disgusted me.\n\n**That\u0019s when I got the idea to design a bag with a removable, waterproof, washable liner so that I could pick up groceries on my Metro commute home from work.** **I decided to tackle this as a design challenge.**\n\n**Why the bags currently on the market, groceries, and public transportation don\u0019t mix well:**\n\n* Backpacks and work bags are too hard to clean if something spills or flakes, making them unsuitable for picking up groceries on the way home from work.\n* Tote bags are too small for picking up a load of groceries, and don\u0019t provide enough of a structure to safely carry items without the weight of items crushing each other.\n* Reusable grocery bags are frankly ugly and are of poor quality, can\u0019t be carried over the shoulder, and often suffer from the same issues as tote bags.\n\n**My solution in the form of bag design:**\n\n* I designed a lightweight, reinforced base so that the items wouldn\u0019t shuffle and crush themselves.\n* I designed a liner compartment that could be easily washed and removed after a spill. It connects via button snaps. Everything else would go into a laptop pocket on the inside so I could keep things organized.\n* The bag needed to be stylish enough so I could take it to work confidently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jc12f22ekz0c1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f7be0df9529b468d42ee96a00f7daa90f7af16\n\n**I re-engineered the tote bag handle design so that the handles were stronger.**\n\nMost importantly, the bag needed to have insanely strong handles. I\u0019ve repaired a few friends\u0019 bags over the years, with all of them ripping at where the handles met the body of the bag.In most handle designs, the weight of the contents are usually distributed at just two small squares.\n\nSo if I were to design a quality work bag that could take heavy loads, I would have to design a strap system with a larger load-surface than the regular tote bag.\n\nI had each handle connect along the entire length of the bottom of the bag, creating a cradle system, and had it run through these tubes that guide the straps down to the bottom of the bag. This creates an extremely strong handle, and gives it a unique look.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apit6a9gjz0c1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=510f68d05c70606d9de570cabbb1b69f2b059bd2\n\n**A year of prototyping in my apartment bedroom and through whatsapp**\n\nAfter a year of prototyping in my apartment and sending plans to manufacturers, I\u0019ve finally launched this bag that will hopefully help us all do our groceries sustainably, comfortably, stylishly.\n\nI call it the \u001cMilmo 1813\u001d (it\u0019s 18 inches by 13 inches)\n\n[Here\u0019s a link to check it out](https://lemilmo.com)!\n\nI'm offering up a piece of my story in the hope that it resonates with others on similar paths. This product is an example of how product design can provide practical, and quality solutions that support a vision of a more accessible, car-independent future. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions! I'm always open to criticsm and discussing design solutions for urbanism and car-independence.\n\n**TLDR: I got tired of carrying around and buying low-quality, uncomfortable grocery bags for doing grocery runs after work, so I designed a work bag that allows me to safely carry my work items, as well as grocery items comfortably over the shoulder. It does this with a removable, washable, waterproof liner that separates my work items from groceries.**",

      "title": "Literally... Trains!",
      "text": "So, given the climate and ecological crisis that we're facing, and how our governments aren't doing jack sh\\*t to combat it. I thought I would share with you some positive insights about how we already *have* the technology to mitigate some of the worse effects of the climate crisis. And how we don't need some fancy \"Tech Bro\" miracle gadgetbahn technology, but rather, use an existing and proven technology that we already have by just implementing it correctly.\n\nAnd the solution is Quite Literally... Trains!\n\nLets start with fuel/power:\n\nMost greenhouse gas emissions, at least in the transportation sector are from cars, planes, and ships, with trains accounting for less than 5%. This is due to many trains being electric power, gaining their energy from the grid via overhead wires, third rail, and hopefully in the future, contactless power transmission.\n\nThere's no need for large batteries that can catch fire, whose manufacturing is terrible for the environment, not to mention the [child-labor](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara) and exploitations.\n\nBy gaining their energy *externally* through the power grid and not needing to carry their own power, so long as the power plants are green, trains are and will continue to be one of the most cleanest and energy efficient mode of transportation.\n\nEven if the trains are powered by diesel, due to the inherit efficiency of trains, the effect is negligible (though they should all be electric).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tld0d4bx8ksd1.jpg?width=3579&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d94a5e0ae45e49181a772e81eaf156ec597c24d\n\n[https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/environment-and-safety/sydney-trains-environment-and-sustainability/why-rail-travel-a](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/environment-and-safety/sydney-trains-environment-and-sustainability/why-rail-travel-a)\n\n[https://www.greenguides.net/post/trains-reduce-carbon-footprint](https://www.greenguides.net/post/trains-reduce-carbon-footprint)\n\nNext, lets go over Physical Space:\n\nEven with trains that have a larger loading gauge of over 3 meters, at most for a double track, including the equipment on the side, a double track is usually under 10 meters wide. That may seem big, but a single highway lane in North American is 3.66 meters (12 feet) wide, not the mention the shoulder, how vegetation near the highway has to be cut so that a car doesn't directly crash into a tree, and don't get my started on a 20 lane highway.\n\nAnd let's not forget, PARKING!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxs9a0k49ksd1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e040c43852c8565275ae827f662aa79555e790a0\n\nSo much space is wasted for parking cars, especially on surface parking lots. Thousands of Arces of land, land that belongs to plants, animals, and people are paved over for a parking lot! F\\*ck surface parking lots especially!\n\nWhereas with trains, a track siding is more than sufficient as the trains can just park in a line parallel to the mainline. And even the largest of train yards do not take up the sheer about of space used for parking cars.\n\nContinuing on with Ecological Impacts:\n\nWhile all human development *does* unfortunately negatively impact the environment, trains can mitigate our impact. Going over the points made before, trains produce little to no air emissions, take up less space, and generally do not impact the environment as badly as cars. And especially with grade separated underground and/or elevated railways, A. They don't cut the environment in half, and B. Once construction is done, nature can reclaim the area, I mean, just look at how trees and vegetation grows around a railway viaduct.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dt1rrp1q9ksd1.jpg?width=1414&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf35509aa48c88beeed47d259589432a80cc688\n\nHuman and Animal Collisions:\n\nIt's no secret that cars kill millions of animals each year and thousands of people! Like holy sh\\*t, F\\*ck Cars!\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nAnd while trains *do* unfortunately hit people and animals, it's nowhere near the same extent as cars for several reasons.\n\nA. Even on a frequent mainline with trains every ten minutes or so, it's nowhere near the constant traffic of a highway, meaning that animals and people can have a chance to cross safely.\n\nB. Trains are more predictable than cars and don't invade so many spaces unlike cars which can crash into you even if you're not crossing the road.\n\nC. Railway lines are more likely to be elevated, greatly reducing the risk of train-people/animal collisions compared to roads which are almost always on the surface.\n\nIf most high-speed and high frequency railway lines are elevated, not only are they grade separated making frequent service and automation easier, but they would have little impact on people and animals once construction is complete as people and animals can just walk underneath without worrying about getting run over, the same can't be said about cars.\n\nResources:\n\nTrains last a long time, like a *really* long time. Many old steam trains are still operational, and more older metro trains from the 1970s and 80s are still in operations. Compared to cars and your iPhone, trains don't need to be visually updated each year, which lets be real here is a massive waste of resources. Unlike personal commodities, trains are made on a per-order basis meaning they're not mass produce, reducing the chance of unsold units.\n\nOnce a timeless, future proof design is met (open gangway metro trains) even trains from a new batch with updated technology can quite literally look [exactly the same](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/canada-line-skytrain-new-trains-in-service) as the older first batch. Also, trains are more likely to be modular and can be upgraded and rebuilt, and generally use less resources than cars. Also, you don't need as many of them to maintain good service.\n\nAnd on the infrastructure side of things, old, wore out steel railway tracks can be recycled into new rails, and due to the better weight distribution of trains, concrete railway viaduct can basically last forever with proper maintenance whereas car destroy their own roads, and there's no need to \"repave\" the way for railways to the same extent as with cars.\n\nCountering suburban sprawl:\n\nCars encourage suburban sprawl, which is devastating towards the environment. One thing that's common in many nature documentaries are scenes of \"human encroachment into nature\" as they show an image of a forest being cut down for houses. The issue here is suburban sprawl, not people as a whole. (Also, it's the rich who produce more waste than anyone else. Blame them, and not humans as a whole).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vr7owdkaksd1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe968f938abff43f931754639ce328d0eea41e2d\n\nContrary to popular belief, having dense cities is actually *better* for the environment than suburban sprawl as no matter what, human development disturbs the natural world. But what we can do is minimize the impact by minimizing the space we use. Having dense cities allows for less space to be taken up by people, and *more* space to left for nature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pk41kgfsaksd1.jpg?width=2856&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dab5829e7863e35d2f527ceb3f5d5473d76f462\n\nAlong with elevated railways that have little impact on nature once completed, trains can reduce suburban sprawl and hence, allow more space for nature.\n\nTrains are a stepping stone in mitigating modern-day, militaristic imperialism (this section is really long and I do go into a rant. Sorry in advance):\n\nThis is a more political point, but think about, how much of modern day imperialism can be tied directly or indirectly to cars? A lot of it in my books. The meme that the United States invades a place with oil is very much true. What was the Iraq War for, oil (not because Saddam has WMDs that never existed or about fighting for \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" nah, it was for oil). What is the Russian invasion of Ukraine for, well it's technically for natural gas, but we might as well say it's for oil.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/niglnu1kbksd1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c048eb886b4e3e39f53fb3a2e1d5162d3dda727\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3ts0tygbksd1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e13b8fa780b16b825b05a4cf89f4920164baf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jvk7efhbksd1.jpg?width=3500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5c3ccc75b592e33dc87730faec9df304e6f46c\n\nAnd why does the U.S. support Israel despite its constant war crimes and that their \"soldiers\" are loudly and proudly posting their war crimes on social media, its for oil, as Isntreal is nothing more than a US military outpost in the Middle East to control its oil. As Joe Biden said back in the 1980s, \"If there wasn't an Israel, we would make an Israel!\"\n\nAlso, my mom's country (Cambodia) was destabilized by US intervention (Operation Menu) which allowed Pol Pot to take over due to the destabilization caused by the bombings. And the US would later support Pol Pot as a way to get back at the Vietnamese. So I have little tolerance for US military supporters and War Hawks in general. Those people can F\\*ck off. Also, the French colonized Indochina for its rubber for car tires. So, F\\*ck the French as well.\n\nRant Over:\n\nSorry for the rant, but to simplify, because the US is so car dependent, and that expensive gas would be devastating towards the US economy. Market forces compells the US to seize cheap oil by any means necessary, hence the lame excuse that \"We're here to spread 'Freedom' and 'Democracy'\" when it's really just for the oil, I mean the US supports the theocratic government of Saudi Arabia for crying out loud.\n\nAnd it's just not only gas cars, many battery-electric cars have the cobalt and lithium for their batteries being mined by literal slave labor! So, even if gas cars are phased out for electric ones, human and ecological exploitation is at the core of the auto industry.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, trains a*re* unfortunately used in imperalism and wars, namely for supplies and resource extraction. But I think I can safely say that while trains were used for imperialist ventures, said imperialist ventures are not *for* trains as trains can be made domestically with relatively little resources, whereas cars, especially electric cars require more rare earth minerals. It was not like the British were here to say \"A yes, we are here to 'civilize' these 'savages' in the name of trains!\" No, they brought trains over for resource extraction, but it wasn't *for* trains.\n\nOf course, the issue here is capitalism, but I won't go too deeply into that for this post. But I can argue that most modern wars for oil are either directly or indirectly cause by cars.\n\nNow, let's compared the crappy imperialist legacy of the auto industry to trains. For the most part, trains can be produce domestically with relatively few resources. Are more likely to be manufactured by a state-owned company which \"usually\" tends to have better labor relations. Are built by skilled personnel, and are make on a per-order basis and *not* mass produced, reducing waste. I forget to mention this part before but to put it simply, trains (the rolling stock themselves) are just not as profitable as cars. But that's not a bad thing as the utility of trains far exceeds that of cars.\n\nNow, in more transit oriented countries, there just isn't the imperialist need for oil to power cars since there's less cars and less reliance on oil. Take Japan for example, gas is expensive, but since the country is less dependent on cars, it can make due without offensive military actions. I know that in Modern day Japan, it has a self defense force which is prohibited from taking part in offensive actions (though that has to do with WW2. Don't get me wrong, Imperial Japan is hella Imperialist which committed countless atrocities, yet their military lacked the oil to continue the long term fight). Needless to say, when a country is less dependent on cars and oil, it's less likely to take part in overt imperialist actions.\n\nThere's still soft power imperialism which is a totally different issue, not to mention that oil is mostly used for energy production, but if countries were less oil and car dependent, it is one step in mitigating modern-day, war-based imperialism (the issue is capitalism, but we need first steps here).\n\nTo conclude this section, and Spicy take here, but I'm gonna say that if you drive a car, *you* support imperialism. I mean, one of the posters on this subreddit literally says \"Stop Putin, Ride a Bike.\"\n\nNow because my previous section was so long, I'll speed run through these points.\n\nNoise Pollution:\n\nCities aren't loud, cars are! And one jerk in a loud car is *way* worse than any train. Also, modern trains are quiet.\n\nLight Pollution:\n\n[Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1fnrw3l/cars_and_light_pollution/)\n\nIn conclusion, at least with my interpretation, much of the problems that we face today can be tied directly and/or indirectly to cars. Climate change? Cars! Ecological Destruction? Cars! Suburban Sprawl? Cars! Child Slave Labor for Lithium? Cars! Imperialist Wars? Cars! Light and Noise Pollution? Cars!\n\nI know my observations may not be fully accurate and that I might be blaming cars on issues that are far more complex, but you can't deny how many issues in the world are caused by cars.\n\nBut one of the solutions to resolving and/or mitigating these issues are trains. So to save the world, we Quite Literally Need... Trains!",

      "text": "https://thewaroncars.org/2024/05/07/125-when-driving-is-not-an-option-with-anna-zivarts/\n\n&gt;The United States has built a transportation system centered around automobiles. But one-third of the nation\u0019s population can\u0019t drive, whether because of disability, age, financial hardship, immigration status, or any of a host of other factors. Those tens of millions of people are often invisible to planners and elected officials, and that\u0019s why Anna Letitia Zivarts, herself a low-vision nondriver and a longtime activist for better transportation choices, has written a new book titled When Driving Is Not an Option: Steering Away from Car Dependency (Island Press). We talked with Anna about how, by designing our transportation future for those who can\u0019t or don\u0019t feel comfortable driving, we could build a system that works better for everyone and that would be more equitable, safer, and more environmentally sustainable.\n\nTIL \"Kinetic elite\"\n\n\n[Problematizing Mobility: A Metaphor of Stickiness, Non-Places and the Kinetic Elite - Jana Costas, 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840613495324)\n\n&gt; A \u0018mobilities turn\u0019 has taken place in the social sciences, which is finding its way into organization studies. As research highlights how work and organization are mobile and spatially dispersed, metaphors of liquidity, flows, fluidity and nomads have become significant. This article seeks to contribute to the mobilities turn by introducing the Sartrean metaphor of stickiness. In contrast to the currently dominant movement metaphors, this metaphor brings into focus ambiguities and frictions and overcomes problematic connotations of nomadism and sedentarism. The paper draws on the metaphor of stickiness to reveal the kinetic elite\u0019s \u0013 the group of highly mobile elite workers \u0013 experiences of \u0018non-places\u0019 (Augé, 1995), which are ephemeral, interchangeable and monotonous spaces of mobility. Qualitative data gathered at two management consultancy firms show how the stickiness of being on the move can give rise to experiences of ambiguity, disorientation and loss: the lures of glamour, escape and liberation from places can collide with non-places that involve fixed instability, feeling stuck and that stick to one even when returning to places. In so doing, the article develops how the metaphor of stickiness can constitute an important lens for understanding and conceptualizing mobilities.\n\nPDF link, this may work directly: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=0da0b51766fd07eafbb3efd99050ebec6abc6fb4 \n\n&gt;&gt;Most importantly for this article, studies have pointed out how mobilities give rise to vagabonds\n\u0013 the modern poor, immigrant, illegal wanderer or temporary worker, on the one hand, and the\nkinetic elite \u0013 the global professional, manager, politician and academic, on the other hand (Bauman,\n1998; Cresswell, 2006). Garsten\u0019s (1999, 2008) studies of temporary workers are particularly reveal-\ning of the vagabonds\u0019 mobility. She notes how they find themselves under a mobility imperative: a\n\u0018forced mobility and uprooting, a relative lack of security and an uncertain future career\u0019 (2008, p.\n65). This results in various struggles, for instance, in terms of keeping up a sense of self and finding\na place in a community. In contrast to the vagabond, the kinetic elite worker, who, some argue,\nforms a new global elite or class (Carroll, 2008; Robinson, 2004), travels freely for pleasure and through choice, enjoys the vagabond\u0019s services and requires the immobilities of others, e.g. the\nsecretary, ground staff. Here, mobility provides the basis to construct an identity of exclusivity,\nsuperiority and wealth as well as of being fast, flexible and unconstrained (Elliott &amp; Urry, 2010;\nFelstead et al., 2005; see also McKenna &amp; Richardson, 2007). Yet, as the empirical analysis will\nshow, not even for the kinetic elite is mobility frictionless \u0013 this importantly underlines the need for\ndeveloping mobility metaphors that capture it as an ambiguous and contradictory phenomenon.",

I know this is nothing unique or special, but I think about this every time I ride my bike to work (a bike shop) downtown and have to fight for my life on streets that used to be accessible by trolley. We were able to sustain a expansive trolley system when our population was only about 20,000. \n\nWhenever there is road construction downtown, they often end up uncovering old trolley tracks, reminding us all of what once was, which I find ironic. They are tearing up terrible five year-old roads built for cars and end up finding the reliable, old trolley tracks that once served thousands in great condition. I really really hope they bring them back one day.",

      "text": "The morning count was 17, which is about as low as that side will ever get, I'm afraid. It's been lower, but not since the lane was much newer and fewer people were accustomed to parking in it. The traffic barrels were out in force again; there must have been 100 of them in the 1.2mile stretch. \n\nI often wonder how big a gap between obstacles I really need to be able to squeeze through, and today I kind of found out: there were two barrels very close together, and I tried to ride between them, and managed to hit both of them with my handlebars. So, the smallest gap I can really use is bigger than that. Good to know. Also good to know that a handlebar collision with a barrel doesn't actually do anything to me. \n\nThe evening count was 65, also very close to the lowest numbers I've seen since the early days. (It got as low as 60 only last week, but sustained counts of under 60 have not been seen since January, right after the lane opened.)\n\nOn that evening commute, a few miles before the 1.2mile stretch in question, I encountered a familiar sight: a cop car, parked in the bike lane. A very short distance behind it, a civilian car, also illegally parked in the bike lane. Way to set the example, NYPD. \n\nLater in the ride, I observed an NYPD van abusing its siren so it could run a red light. This helped it gain a little speed, but very soon after car traffic did what car traffic always does, and, still-wailing siren notwithstanding, the van couldn't move an inch. A bunch of pedestrians jaywalked right in front of it with impunity, because if the only people empowered to enforce the law can't even stop actively breaking it, why should anyone else obey it? Also, it's not like the cops in the van could do anything about it; they were stuck, and no amount of fake siren usage could help them.\n\nBut maybe the siren usage was not fake? Maybe there was a genuine emergency somewhere ahead? Nah. There was another cop car at the very next intersection, parked (illegally, of course, but in a bus lane, not a bike lane, a refreshing change of specific method of citizen abuse), its two cops doing absolutely nothing.",

      "text": "Cars are probably one of the dumbest and most wasteful ways you could try to move billions of people around from A to B every day. The average weight of a car is 1300kg, the average weight of a person is  62kg, which means when a person drives to work, over 95% of the energy, resources, space consumed and pollution goes into moving the car itself. Then when you're at work, the car just sits there most the day, taking up space and resources, not being utilised. It's so wasteful, individual transport is just plain stupid. Cars spew out pollution, changing the climate and filling our air with toxic fumes. We breath in micro-particles contained in the exhaust of cars, particles so small they pass through cell membranes and fuck with us, give us cancer and all sorts of diseases. The toxic fumes of cars stink, the engines are noisy, even the wheels are noisy. Endless piles of tyres build up, because cars are designed to need disposable products like wheels.\n\nCars are what you get when the free market is left to decide how we live, there is no plan with cars, it's just millions of individual consumers and companies all deciding to do what is individually good for them, with no greater plan, no coordination, just the wasteful and ignorant direction of the free market producing the cluster fuck on civilisation that is cars and the roads they require. With cars you are forever remaking billions of individual vehicles as each one lives a mere generation, all the while you're constantly remaking endless stretches of roads which eventually crack and wear under the weight of all those cars and trucks. It's madness on a monumental scale, a scale so vast that it changes the landscape and climate of the entire planet.\n\nSo what could we do differently? Almost anything would be better.  Personally I'm an electrified train and tram guy, I think bikes can fill in the gaps, especially electric bikes. I think that if we took a tiny fraction of what we spend on cars collectively as individuals and governments, then applied this tiny fraction to electrified trains, trams, cycling infrastructure and subsidies on bikes and ebikes, we wouldn't want cars. For those situations where the collective system doesn't work, we could always have a few electrified cabs, but those situations are rare in a transportation system organised correctly. The collective benefits from the efficiency, the fresh air, the quiet, the enormous cost savings and sustainability would all make up for any loses to select individuals. Then there are the car enthusiasts, but they're dumb enough that they'd forget about cars quickly enough, besides, they could always just get fucked and find a hobby that doesn't destroy the planet.\n\nI'm also a big believer in relocalisation, alternative systems of planning that don't rely on the free market to decide where people live, systems that have intelligent planning and would produce communities where people live near where they work and can just ride a bike, walk or catch a tram. We often forget that a big part of the problem is that people often live hours from where they work, this is insanely inefficient for billions to be travelling so far every day, simply because the system responsible for organising where individuals live has no intelligence behind it at all and doesn't optimise anything for anyone.\n\nIf I could live in a world without cars I would, but for now as this is just a dream, I'll take solace in the fact that there are others out there like me that find the whole transportation situation in our modern world one of the biggest, dumbest spectacles that this planet will ever have the misfortune of witnessing.",

Any city &gt;5 million people metro downtown that insist on car reliance as a method of transport are simply looking for a population sustainability issue given how inefficient car is regarding of the use of very precious space (parking, congestion).\n2. Cars use case is mostly rural where the density isn\u0019t justifying the public transport except for the cheapest &amp; most unreliable one possible and the land is on discount.\n3. EV crank it to 11 because rural electricity is by it\u0019s nature is subsidized by city where the density allow cheaper electricity (thanks to economy of scale) which enables said city grid to subsidize the area around the city (the suburbs) but any city that know what they\u0019re doing (Tokyo, Amsterdam, most German city, Paris, London, Singapore) know that suburbs still have to be given a coverage of public transport because eventually people that lived in suburbs works in the metro and if they\u0019re allowed to bring in their cars it will cause the same problem with the car ownership in the downtown regardless of the legality of owning cars in downtown.\n\nWhy cars are oversaturated:\n1. We never have a actual invention of new car technology since Hybrids (EV first prototype was more than century old) which made the technological barrier to this industry relatively small compared to let\u0019s say a chip fab.\n2. Which makes every country down to the low income countries that have a industrial base like China, Russia &amp; India to be able to make their own cars (albeit with varied success in capturing the market share).\n3. Compound that with some country like China, Japan, South Korea implementing textbook fascism and transfer everything (including confiscated bank deposit (in China case)) to the manufacturing of cars to make sure that there\u0019s no mass unemployment regardless of the demand of said cars &amp; the other car producing countries reaction to said textbook fascism move.

I don't drive because I can usually get to somewhere faster on the train anyway.\n\nOver lockdown my work assigned me to a job working with a client's team. I like the work but the car-centric office location is pushing me to the brink where I'm considering quitting!\n\nTheir office is on a massive industrial estate that's a spaghetti mess of dual carriageways (70mph with no pavements).\n\nDay 1 I arrived by catching a train to the nearest railway station.

There are more than enough parking spaces for everyone to come in their own car.\n\nHowever, somebody tipped me off that there is a shuttle bus from the office to the railway station. I searched for it online and found a massive publicity piece about how the company is committed to sustainability and helping people travel by train etc. etc.. only to look at the timetable and see that there are 3 times in the morning around 9am and 3 times in the afternoon around 4pm, so I can't even do a full working day.\n\nI find it so frustrating that this company just wants to pay lip service to their sustainability stance but can't even put on a reasonable bus service.\n\nUnfortunately I now have to take a taxi from the station to the office even though it's such a short distance.\n\nI spoke to my boss about this issue and how impractical it is and his solution?    \"Just buy a car\"",

      "title": "Unpopular opinion : high speed rail is overhyped",
      "text": "Some examples : \n\n- France's TGV is often perceived as a prime example the US should strive for concerning high speed rail. And for the most part, it is. If you travel between Paris and another major city. Yes, Paris-Marseille (over 800km) in 3 hours is an awesome feat of technology, planning, and politics, and yes, you can do that for 10¬ in low cost subsidized TGVs. BUT. French TGV lines were built at the cost of the pre-existing densely networked classical speed train lines. If you don't live in a major urban center, and by this i really mean one of the biggest french cities, the train may be 3 times faster than 50 years ago, but it doesn't stop in your town anymore, you lost to the change. The french train network is now a nightmarish Paris-entered radial system, that basically forces you to take a car if you want to travel between two non-Paris places. A network of local trains still exists, but nothing as dense as 50 years ago.\n\n- China is often praised in this sub for having developed an extensive hsr system in 10 years. Good. But now, even subsidized, the ticket is too expensive for the average Chinese people. Most people taking these routes uses cheaper, classical speed trains, leaving the hs trains empty. Now, China struggle to repay the debt it contracted for building these lines, and the oldest ones are slowly falling in disrepair. Imagine how good of a network China could have today if that money was used to build a classical speed network, deserving many of the small town of the continent size country, that Chinese people could actually afford to travel on. And where the ticket money could actually pay for maintenance. But no, because China wanted a vanity project that would be talked about internationally (and on this front, they succeeded), and classical trains are not sexy enough for that. (Disclaimer: never been to China, argument based on secondary sources)\n\n- I will not comment on Germany and Spain, as I have not travelled there often. I was told Ice and Ave where good, but I suspect they would be subject to issues similar than the ones in France.\n\n- Most notably: I will not comment on the Shinkansen. I know it is considered as the best hsr system, but I have no idea on the state of the Japanese local train network. And by now you know my opinion: hsr means nothing if there is no solid, dense underlying rail network.\n\n- On the other hand : Switzerland is hands down the queen of public transportation, especially rural transportation. Any town with at least 500 inhabitants -&gt; railway station. Even town smaller than that often have one. And railway station means a MINIMUM of an hourly service in each direction. Aside from that, EVERY population center, how small it may be, is serviced by at least one bus stop, and bus lines also have an hourly minimum frequency. Meaning that, living in Switzerland, even in the most remote of areas, you never need a car. And for those who would argue that this is only possible because of how densely populated the country is : 200 hab/km^2. Yes, it is a dense country, but this is the same density than the UK or Germany. And despite that, city center to city center travel is still faster by train than by car. Oh. And 100% railway electrification. Switzerland achieved that without a single piece of track over 200 km/h.\n\nAs a lot of people in this sub are Americans, my final argument is : Of course I want sustainable transportation without the need of cars. But to achieve that effectively, america should not strive for hsr, they should want these billions to be invested in a dense network of classical speed trains, with better service for the community. Yes, HSR is a nice convenience, especially in a country as large as the US. But transcontinental train travel is just a sweet dream for now, and all the lines where hsr makes sense now could be serviced by solid sleeper trains, with more frequent stops and more frequent trains. For the same price and the same quantity of political battling, you need to chose between frequent train, servicing every town, or a few speedy bois, very convenient for city center people, but of no use for everyone else. I'll root for the former any day of my life. It may be less flashy, but it is better for nearly everyone in their everyday life.\n\nTL;DR : HSR is the icing on the cake for a public transportation system. If many places focused on making a decent cake before worrying about the icing, rail transport would be better for almost everyone.",

      "title": "Americans are Spoiled",
      "text": "I know this post is going to be controversial, but we need to be realistic. Americans by and large consume a disproportionate amount of resources compared to people in other parts of the world. if Everyone had American levels of consumption we would need 2 - 3 additional Earths to sustain it. \n\nAmericans dislike traffic, noise, pollution, ever widening roads and other negative externalities that cars create but most dislike any policies that would reduce the number of cars. Whether it be allowing businesses to not build parking, mind you not forcing them, or imposing congestion pricing on roads or converting roads and streets into bus lanes. Americans dislike the disruptions road maintenance and road widening create even though these are necessary to accommodate larger amounts of cars. \n\nAmericans dislike a lot of the negative externalities sprawl creates such as the loss of open space, so we will create urban growth boundaries and zone land for farming to try to fix this. Then we continue impose limits to density such as height restrictions, single family zoning, setback requirements, parking requirements, and so forth and there is heavy resistance to changing any of these policies. We do these things and wonder why housing in unaffordable and why we still have negative externalities from sprawl that is created elsewhere.  Many people don't want housing to be affordable even if it means a lack of workers for services they use or lack of maids or requiring those people to do 2 - 3 hour commutes.\n\nPeople will fight against expanding transit to their areas because it will bring \"bad elements\", even if those are the workers who services they depend on. They'll use every environmental regulation under the sun to delay transit projects even if the objections are bogus. People will even vote for transit expansion some times but will complain about any temporary disruption construction creates even if it will eventually go away. \n\nI am guilty of this one (though I am working on it), we eat way more than we need to and throw away perfectly good food.\n\nWe constantly buy and throw away perfectly good electronics.\n\nAmericans dislike high energy prices but live lifestyles that waste vast quantities of energy. Everything from using dryers instead of hanging clothes, not daylighting buildings and running lights during the day, ever increasing house sizes, and driving cars that are less fuel efficient than what are available. For reference the average US is fuel efficiency is 25 mpg. Most people don't realistically need large trucks or SUVS to get around. Even when transit is available and is practical to use people will choose not to use it.\n\nAmericans want \"alternative energy sources\" but then complain when they actually get built that they have some sort of issues. No energy source is perfect, but Americans basically expect electricity production with zero externalities, which is not practical.  And when they complain about something that has zero externalities, they never bother to think of using less energy.\n\nAmericans complain about a lack of industrial jobs, but we basically expect industries to create zero externalities. \n\nSo the long and short of it is that higher gas prices suck for the average person, this I fully understand and I have to deal with myself. However, Americans by and large only dislike the negative affects of their lifestyle choices, they don't dislike the lifestyle choices that create these negative affects. Americans need to realize that if they want the negative externalities and economics costs of their lifestyles to go away, they need to live different lifestyles and not simply hope that their lifestyles will some how stop doing this to them. We shouldn't look at Americans as victims, but rather as participants. We shouldn't blame governments for implementing policies that most of their citizens want. And this isn't meant to create some sort of moral high ground, but simply to deal with reality. We should also use these high gas prices as opportunity to change people's thinking and change people's actions. People both need to feel the pain their lifestyle choices create and need to understand the source of it.",

      "text": "https://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/64535\n\n&gt; **Sinn Féin publish plan for a safer, affordable, more accessible public transport system**\n\n&gt; Sinn Féin spokesperson on Transport, Representative Darren O\u0019Rourke TD, today published his party\u0019s plan to invest significantly in our public transport system in order to help to drive down carbon emissions and create a safer, affordable, more accessible public transport network.\n\n&gt; The Meath East TD said:\n\n&gt; \u001cIn order to encourage more people onto public transport, we need to address the underlying problems of cost, accessibility and safety.\n\n&gt; \u001cThe price of a train journey for a family can be prohibitive, while the monthly cost of commuting is eating into the already stretched finances of workers.\n\n&gt; \u001cSinn Féin are proposing to make the 20% fare reduction permanent and cut the cost of tickets for under 18s by 50%. This would make public transport more attractive and affordable, for more people.\n\n&gt; \u001cWe are calling for the 20% fare reduction to be extended to Commercial Bus Operators, who provide important connectivity in the regions, but who have been forgotten about by this government.\n\n&gt; \u001cWe also want to address the lack of public transport options in rural Ireland.\n\n&gt; \u001cOur rail network is a skeleton of what it once was, and we want to address this. In addition to the NDP projects, we are committing to delivering the Navan Rail Line and Western Rail Corridor.\n\n&gt; \u001cCombined these projects would deliver important new connectivity and provide for an additional 2,375,000 sustainable passenger journeys each year, delivering significant benefits for the regions and our environment.\n\n&gt; \u001cFor those living in rural Ireland accessing services, employment and education is difficult if not impossible, without using a private car. \n\n&gt; \u001cTherefore, we are proposing an acceleration of the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural bus plan, to give rural communities more transport options.\n\n&gt; \u001cFor those with a disability, using public transport can still be a nightmare. Broken lifts, inaccessible bus stops or having to give 24 hours\u0019 notice of travel is still a reality for many.\n\n&gt; \u001cOver a five-year period, we would deliver the total investment needed to make our train stations, bus stations and bus stops fully wheelchair accessible.\n\n&gt; \u001cWe also need to address the anti-social behaviour that puts people off using buses, trams and trains. Therefore, instead of just talking about it, we have included proposals to establish a public transport policing unit.\n \n&gt; \u001cOur progressive proposals show that we can cut emissions, whilst also delivering social and economic benefits for citizens at the same time.\u001d\n\n&gt; Sinn Féin's 'Driving down emissions with public transport' proposals can be [read here.](https://mcusercontent.com/ffc5ff2fa2294c89d2ff7598e/files/2c683eca-d04f-e7a3-99f1-cc5cd045d3eb/Driving_down_emissions_with_public_transport.pdf)\n\nIt\u0019s not the exact merits of these proposals that\u0019s interesting so much as  the fact the largest party in Ireland is trying to outbid the governing coalition - which includes the Irish Green Party - on sustainable transport. At least rhetorically.\n\nProbably means there\u0019s no prospect of pro-car elements attempting to reverse the current direction of travel in Irish politics.",

      "title": "Criminal Justice Reform, and \u001cCar Culture\u001d as a Means for State Control",
      "text": "We often look at the issues surrounding car ownership with the relation to things like&\n\n* environmental sustainability \n\n* health and wellness\n\n* city infrastructure \n\n* more free time\n\n* etc.\n\nBut I want to talk about it in the realm of how the state can use this car dependency as a way to more effectively control its citizens, and how it connects with the larger issue of criminal justice reform. \n\nIn the book \"Usual Cruelty: The Complicity of Lawyers in the Criminal Injustice System\" by Alec Karakatsanis (2019), the author makes several interesting points regarding arrests for \u001cdriving with a suspended license\u001d. The linked sources are from the Notes section of the book\n\n\u001c[M]any jurisdictions, the single most common criminal prosecution is for [driving with a suspended license](http://www.chronline.com/crime/state-senators-propose-reform-for-driving-with-suspended-license-law/article_2996cdf8-f824-11e7-bd9e-ff4084d58384.html), and about [forty percent of suspended American drivers\u0019 licenses were taken away not for any reason related to driving, but because a person was too poor to pay court debts](https://www.npr.org/2015/01/05/37269-1918/how-drivers-license-suspensions-unfairly-target-the-poor).\u001d\n\n\u001cCalifornia took away [4.2 million drivers\u0019 licenses](https://www.lccr.com/wp-content/uploads/Not-Just-a-Ferguson-Problem-How-Traffic-Courts-Drive-Inequality-in-California-4.8.15.pdf) because people could not pay court debts. In the past five years, Tennessee took away [more than 250,000 licenses for inability to pay tickets and more than 140,000 licenses for inability to pay other court debts](https://dailymemphian.com/article/740/Court-orders-state-to-stop-suspending-licenses-of-people-too-poor-to-pay-debt). Because dozens of states have done the same thing, millions more people have lost the ability to do all of the things many of us take for granted in life\u0014go to the grocery store, attend church, commute to work, and visit family\u0014as \u001cdriving on a suspended license\u001d has [become one of the most commonly charged crimes by prosecutors in many jurisdictions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/more-than-7-million-people-may-have-lost-drivers-licenses-because-of-traffic-debt/2018/05/19/9767-8c08-5785-11e8-b656-a5f8c2a9295d_story.html). **In such circumstances, that crime serves no function other than to criminalize poverty.**\u001d (Emphasis added by me)\n\nWhy would the state want to discourage people from driving cars when it\u0019s such an effective way to throw more people into the criminal justice system? It\u0019s a highly lucrative business. The prison system is literally state-controlled slavery. It\u0019s a multi-billion dollar industry (bail bondsmen, court costs, police, jails, prisons, etc). And it needs fresh bodies every day to keep it running.\n\nIf more people had access to public transportation, it would mean less people being tossed into the open maw of this \u001cpunishment bureaucracy\u001d as the author calls it. \n\nKeep this in mind when you hear things like \u001cbail reform\u001d and other issues related to criminal justice reform. It might not have to do with cars directly, but it\u0019s all connected.",

      "title": "Concern over increase in anti e-scooter propaganda in Australian media",
      "text": "I attempted to post this article in r/Australia though had it deleted with no reason given, so figured I'd preach it to the choir instead :-) \n\nTL:DR at end.\n\nRecently there have been a flood of articles in Australian media with titles like \"Concerns increase in fires linked to lithium-ion batteries in e-scooters and e-bikes\". One online ABC article about the issue was originally posted with the false statement that \"Hundreds of e-scooters and e-bikes are catching fire in Australian homes...\" That wildly inaccurate bit of information has since been removed, but not before a [Google crawler indexed it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hundreds+of+e-scooters+and+e-bikes+are+catching+fire+in+Australian+homes)\n\nDespite media reports to the contrary, e-scooters and e-bikes are not bursting into flames at an alarming rate. Over 5.5 years to mid 2022, there were less than 100 lithium-ion battery fires in Australia reported to the ACCC; remember, a dozen or more lithium-ion battery containing products can be found in the average Australian home today, including in laptops, tablets, children's toys, drills, etc. [Only 9 (yes nine) of those fires were caused by batteries inside e-mobility devices.](https://consultation.accc.gov.au/accc/lithium-ion-batteries-issues-paper/supporting_documents/ACCC%20Lithiumion%20Batteries%20Issues%20Paper.pdf) Nine e-scooter and e-bike fires over 5.5 years, compared to 10's of thousands of car fires over the same period (speculative based on [&gt;9,000 car fires in NSW alone in just a 36-month period](https://www.fireextinguisheronline.com.au/blog/post/electric-vehicle-fire-extinguisher-australia)).\n\nSo why the media frenzy on these devices being a risk? Vehicle manufacturers and energy companies have been manipulating the media and controlling the narrative around transport options for 100 years now ([reference 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOttvpjJvAo), [reference 2](https://www.drilledpodcast.com/)), they are world renowned experts at [manufacturing consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU).\n\nIn urban areas, a substantial amount of the distance we drive is for short trips, easily achievable by e-mobility devices. In Sydney, [50% of all vehicle km driven are for trips less than 5km](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/HTS%20Report%20Sydney%202012-13.pdf). If we are allowed to view new e-mobility options as the cheap, convenient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, spatially sustainable, and relatively safe products that they are, then we'll stop driving cars as much as we do. In turn, we'd also start demanding governments do more to make our streets safer for those who aren't driving cars... which in turn will cause more people take up alternative transport options.\n\nLeft unchecked, e-mobility devices have the potential to significantly reduce the amount we drive cars in our cities; this will hurt the bottom line of amongst the richest and most powerful businesses in the world. Something they will not allow to happen without a fight. Their decades old signature move? Narrative control and media manipulation.\n\nTL:DR; E-scooters and e-bikes are not catching fire at the rate the media is portraying, not even remotely. It is likely the usual powers are at work to ensure the general public are terrified of any transport option that is not a privately owned car.",

      "text": "Hey everyone it\u0019s my first text post here so sorry if I come off as ignorant. I\u0019m a very big fan of dense, mixed used, urban, transit oriented development, like many of you all. \n\nA question I\u0019ve been thinking of is with the current state of affairs with the housing market exploding and demand being at an all time high, why are cities not making use of what I\u0019m seeing as an effective blank check for development, and rushing to capitalize on this demand as fast as possible.\n\nAny city that wanted to become a world class city could essentially do that right now, with an almost guaranteed return on their investment. Through massive amounts of new development, of which the demand would instantly eat up all units made, any city would gain a sustainable new tax base that could fund many insane expansions for their public transportation systems, and other quality of life improvements. While also making cities more affordable.\n\nWhile cities are developing, the rate at which they are given the current climate is confusing. I would remove pretty much all barriers to building mixed use developments as quickly as possible and capitalize on that demand before the market would return to normal.\n\nThe demand for walkable, urban environments is clearly there. The question is, why aren\u0019t cities doing this?",

      "text": "Being able to live car-free can save one a lot of money. Not having to pay for gas, car payment, car insurance, maintenance, etc. would be huge savings for most people. \n\nHowever, what sucks about Austin, TX, and most US cities, is that it\u0019s easier to be car-free the closer you live to the center of the city- I mean, duh. But, the closer you get to the center of the city, or its downtown, the more expensive housing gets. I get frustrated that the people who can afford to live in the most expensive part of the city don\u0019t take advantage of the walkability or the public transit infrastructure that they have at their disposal. \n\nEssentially, they take advantage of the fact that their car trips are significantly shorter due to their proximity to the city center. However, the addition of these resident\u0019s cars on the roads increases traffic for everyone else, most notably, those who can\u0019t afford to live closer to utilize this infrastructure, thus ruining the whole point of people living in the city center to begin with! =$ \n\nI just despise people who can afford to live there not utilizing the benefits of living there and instead, making traffic worse for everyone else including themselves. It\u0019s so frustrating and causes a strain on the whole transportation system and flow in the city! They\u0019re the true drain on the system in my opinion& =\u0012 \n\nI know I\u0019m preaching to the choir but, I get so frustrated by car culture and how it ruins the point of what makes city living so awesome: proximity to amenities, being able to cut out the expenses of owning a car by not having to have one, etc.",

      "title": "It's Inevitable That America Will Abandon Car Dependency",
      "text": "And not by choice, either, nor some form of climate or oil disaster. It's an impending economic certainty. And we can move things along.\n\nAmerica has been on a dangerous slope of global rising prices - and cars are just one of those core issues, one we can hopefully control.\n\nEach year, more economic power has been funneled upwards from the lower and middle class and into the hands of rich. In fact, the wealth divide has [grown to levels last seen in the Great Depression.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-been-almost-a-100-years-since-the-americas-1-had-so-much-wealth-2019-02-11) At this rate, our taxes simply won't be able to keep up.\n\nAs the dollar value decreases for each American, and the cost of maintaining car infrastructure grows, it's not likely that future car dependent sprawl can be sustained by sourcing yet more land and development for Federal tax revenue. Especially as cities go through a phase of economic decline from the impending recession, the Federal Government can not hope to outspend time itself in the midst of a economic crash.\n\nWhat is likely to happen is that once the bubble pops, it may put a large pause on new construction and development in major cities, and cut off typical maintenance for excessive roads when the funds run dry. This is what causes cities to go bankrupt; the revenue of new developments stagnates, and investors demand their dues. This has happened dozens of times before, as cities tend to ebb and flow with new construction every year; but a threat like this could drastically reduce growth, and massively impact cities for years to come. This would lead to a gap in repairs, maintenance, and upgrades, causing roads to quickly fall into dysfunction if not properly maintained. And with the growing rise of anti-car pedestrians, and growing pedestrian culture, this could be an opportune moment to swing development towards a more sustainable, affordable future.\n\nOne of the core arguments for Pro-Pedestrian infrastructure is the vastly decreased cost; bike lanes and large sidewalks don't need excessive maintenance, are cheaper to build, and can last far longer than any road could hope for. Couple this with an impending economic downturn that would personally affect many Americans, and ridership of cars may actually plummet once again in favor of cheaper options. This would be a key moment for local Governments to consider blighted road infrastructure for an overhaul.\n\nWe can further speed along this change by using this collapse wisely. Car-centered development is too costly for a country out of its prime to maintain. America is not in its prime any longer; that is becoming abundantly clear, and if things don't change, they will risk a massive decline in quality of life and businesses will find it hard to weather the storm. Not to mention, more and more people will be marooned without hope of transit.\n\nSo, if you're planning on staying in America for an event like this, I'd recommend writing letters to your city council, your mayor, your governor - what have you, starting right now. Make it a monthly deal; one day of every month, take the time to send an email, a letter, a call to your local politicians and demand change. Here's some key issues you could include in your grievances (best to write these out yourself, even just a few short sentences will get you places).\n\n1. The city could benefit immensely by replacing cluttered roads with more walkable corridors. This would decrease traffic in the surrounding area, and increase the quality of life and health of the residents at the same time.\n2. Removing single family housing, minimum parking requirements, and investing into infill development could both dramatically increase tax revenue, increase emergency response time, and lower the average cost of maintenance in the area dramatically. By increasing city density, you decrease the amount of land services must cover - including electric, water, sewer, runoff, gas, and all forms of emergency service like police and firefighters.\n3. The majority of all trips in America are done by car, and are under 2 miles away from the home of the individual traveling. Removing the need for a car in these two mile strips by adding segregated biking lanes would reduce emissions and save wear and tear on existing roads by simply reducing traffic.\n4. Public transit is a large cost up front, which pays for itself over time, even with maintenance included. By implementing trams, buses, subways, and trains within the city, you could connect hubs of commerce and improve the driving experience for those who choose to drive - by simply removing drivers off of the road.\n5. You increase the independence of the residents in the area by giving more pedestrian oriented options, as this allows even handicapped residents some form of freedom of movement.\n6. You would reduce drunk driving incidences in areas with mixed use development, especially if you remove driving as an option in that area.\n7. The majority of city dwellers are already within walking distance of their most common destinations, but can not feasibly walk anywhere due to the sheer overabundance of car infrastructure. Implementing bigger and safer sidewalks and dedicated biking infrastructure would see an increase in pedestrians and decrease in cars on any road. \n8. Reducing parking lot sizes of large stores does not impact their business if there are other methods to reach this store efficiently.\n9. Transit times should be on par with cars, to ensure high ridership. The more individuals opting for transit, the less damage to the city's roads, the less in costs of maintenance the city has to pay.\n\nYou can find your representative [here.](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)\n\nYou can find ALL officials above you [here.](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials)\n\nThis is an honest effort. Use this thread as a place to compile data or other talking points, anything to steer the conversation in the right way with the right people. If you know your politicians are carbrained, claim it's not American to have no right to movement without a car, that liberty can't be paid for in gas and tires.",

      "text": "I recently adventured across Europe and the Northeast for most of 2023 and enjoyed the walkability and transit of these places a lot. Coming home to Houston for the holidays, however, I can't help but feel like it feels greener. Walkable cities have parks but the rest of the cities, the non-park part, feel very devoid of any nature. I was walking through the suburbs in Houston and while the stroads and strip malls were gross, I did appreciate the green space from the opulent lawns, grassy medians on the stroads, and the mini-gardens+trees lining the parking lots. I know lawns are unsustainable but that green space could be replaced with sustainable perennial greens. I just appreciate that it exists for my viewing pleasure.\n\nI find this hard to reconcile. I want to like walkable cities more but I really crave seeing trees and green, and not just at a few parks or a few urban lonely trees sticking out of concrete. I want to see it interspersed throughout the city. Then I don't have to go to a park necessarily to get my green fix.\n\nWhy does it feel this way? Can anything be done to fix it?",

      "text": "Palm oil is all over the news for being incredibly destructive to indigenous forests and wildlife. People go out of their way not to buy Nutella paste because it contains palm oil. In reality **50% of palm oil is used as fuel for cars and trucks.**\n\nSource: [https://te-cdn.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/Food-vs-Fuel\\_-Part-2\\_Vegetable-oils-in-biofuels.pdf](https://te-cdn.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/Food-vs-Fuel_-Part-2_Vegetable-oils-in-biofuels.pdf)\n\nSome quotes from that document that is a few years old now but probably still pretty accurate:\n\n\"18% of the world\u0019s vegetable oil production goes to ~~bio~~diesel. Nearly all of which is fit for human consumption. \\[...\\] Europe alone burns over 17,000 tonnes of rapeseed and sunflower oil every day - the equivalent of nearly 19 million bottles of best cooking oil, every single day.\"\n\n\"The amount of palm and soy [who\u0019s a *literal* soyboy now?] oil burned each year \\[in the EU\\] (4.7 Mt) is equivalent to yet another **14 million bottles per day**. In 2018, most of the palm oil used for biodiesel originated from Indonesia (65%)\u001d\n\nBiofuel feedstocks grown on land cleared from tropical forests, such as soybeans in the Amazon and oil palm in Southeast Asia, **generate particularly high greenhouse gases emissions** (Fargione, J., et al. 2008. \u001cLand clearing and the biofuel carbon debt.\u001d *Science* 319: 1235\u00131238.) (Quoted [here](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/economics-biofuels))\n\nI found some of theses sources in this article linking \"bio\"fuel use with \"food shortages\" and hunger: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/30/crops-cars-starving-biofuels-climate-sustainable](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/30/crops-cars-starving-biofuels-climate-sustainable)\n\nMore generally the amount of farmland that is devoted to growing crops to be burnt in cars is absurd.\n\nAlso:\n\n\"Biofuel production and processing practices can also release GHGs. Fertilizer application releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Most biorefineries operate using fossil fuels. Some research suggests that GHG emissions resulting from biofuel production and use, including those from indirect land use change, may be higher than those generated by fossil fuels, depending on the time horizon of the analysis [(Melillo et al. 2009, Mosnier et al. 2013)](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/economics-biofuels).\"\n\nI will stop calling any fuel \"bio\" and I will enjoy my Nutella spread thank you very much.",

Overall making fun on anyone who cares about the environment because we all use and consume stuff and so aren't we just laughable hypocrites.\n\nI said i actually don't think electric cars will solve our environmental problems or help us develop more sustainable cities.  I said i don't feel people that own them are inherently better, some people buy them for status symbols, I know they take up energy and batteries have mined lithium.  I said better planning of cities and development where less people have to use cars and getting less cars on the road is a more important goal.  It could even make it better for those who want to drive and emergency vehicles if there is less traffic.\n\nStill I get most people currently in the US have to deal with a reality where you have to drive.  I'm not the one judging someone for having a car, electric or not, i don't know their situation.  And the state of our electric grid is not an individual person's fault even if we can make the choice to use less energy.  I overheat easy and I live in Florida, I'm using AC.  I like that options for different kind of vehicles exist, we need to look at all options even if i don't think it is THE solution and that ultimately we need less cars.  And that i don't like the idea that if you can't be perfect it is not worth doing something at all. \n\nBoth of my comments got a laugh react from them.  \n\nI can't explain how much it hurts to try so hard to be reasonable and understanding and get laugh reacts.

      "text": "I know this sub is largely US-centered, but I wanted to share the perspective from Antwerp, Belgium\u0014a mid-sized city (around 500k) with a large port and a bustling ring road that\u0019s part of a major European transport artery. The ring road is almost always clogged with cargo trucks, but the real story lies in the city center.\n\nAntwerp used to be all about cars. Traffic choked the streets, even in the medieval heart of the city. But then, things began to change. People started using bikes. And the city responded. They built a station-based bike-sharing system, and even a right-wing administration saw the advantages of this shift (even though they still shy away from being openly anti-car). They introduced \"zone 30\" streets (where the speed limit is 30 km/h) and \"bike streets,\" where cars are guests and not allowed to pass bikes.\n\nFast forward to today, and it's amazing how the streets have transformed. Electric bikes, cargo bikes, and longtails are everywhere, and it\u0019s now a common sight to see cars moving slowly, adjusting to the new flow of traffic that\u0019s largely led by cyclists.\n\nLast year, we went car-free as a family. My older sons, who are 12 and 10, bike to school independently, and my youngest, who\u0019s only five, rides his own bike to school with me (helmet on, of course). My wife commutes to work (about 10 km) on her electric bike.\n\nWhile we all have our own bikes, we also make use of Antwerp\u0019s growing bike-sharing systems: Velo (a station-based city bike system), Donkey Republic (electric bikes), and Cargoroo (cargo bike sharing). When we really need a car, we use one of two car-sharing services: Cambio (where you return the car to its pick-up point) or Poppy (where you can drop it off in any participating city). Not once have we been unable to get a car when needed, and it\u0019s far more flexible. If I need a small car, I get a small car. Need a van for moving stuff? No problem. When the family heads out for a weekend, I can get a spacious hatchback.\n\nAnd yes, we do save a lot of money. I calculated that we used to spend about ¬500 a month on total car costs (depreciation, taxes, insurance, fuel, repairs). Now, we rent out our underground parking spot and use the rent to cover all our car rentals. We\u0019re literally saving over ¬500 every month with zero loss of comfort. Plus, no more worries about breakdowns, accidents, or unexpected repair costs.\n\nBut honestly, the savings aren\u0019t even the best part. I\u0019ve read that not owning a car is one of the most impactful things you can do for the environment. It feels good to know that we\u0019re contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future, and it\u0019s incredibly empowering to live without being dependent on a car.\n\nI can honestly say I *love* my car-free life now. The freedom, the savings, and the simplicity have been life-changing.",

      "title": "The Dark Side of Convenience: How Cars Contribute to Increased Disposal",
      "text": "Hey Reddit community,\n\nToday, I want to talk about a topic that caught my attention during my recent move and got me thinking. It's about the impact of cars on our tendency to simply throw things away instead of reusing or recycling them.\n\nRecently, I moved out of my old apartment and took the opportunity to reevaluate my possessions. I either sold or gave away nearly everything, and only disposed of very few items that were truly beyond repair. I realized that the main reason behind this was my lack of mobility - or rather, my dependence on a car.\n\nImagine if I had had a car. The temptation to toss everything into the trunk and drive it to the landfill would have been significant. It definitely would have been easier, but at what cost? A functional toaster, a chair that could be easily fixed, maybe even a part of my old bookshelf - all of these things could have been abandoned rather than given a second chance.\n\nIt's alarming to realize how much cars can influence our attitude towards reuse and sustainability. The convenience they offer often leads us to take the path of least resistance, even when it comes to disposing of things. This raises the question of how many valuable resources we waste simply because it's easier to get rid of something instead of repairing or passing it on.\n\nLet's discuss: How can we better utilize the convenience of cars without falling into the trap of a disposable culture? How can we shape our consumption habits to waste less and develop greater appreciation for the things we own?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences on this topic!\n\n**TL;DR:** My move showed me how cars can lead us to thoughtlessly discard items instead of preserving or recycling them. The convenience of cars often tempts us to take the easy way out and dispose of things rather than giving them a second chance. Let's discuss how to overcome this disposable culture.",

      "text": "So back in 2014 the EU proposed to build a 60 Km train line between the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and the tourism hotspot that is Maspalomas in the south of the island, going through the airport and some other important places. A 60 Km train line that supposedly costs 1,550 million euro, money that would be covered by the EU and the rest of it would have to be done by the locals.\n\nThe project has been stuck as an idea for 8 years now and the ULPGC (University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) posted an article stating the  main reasons as to why it won't work:\n\n1.\"The project would not be economically sustainable.\" Because having a train built essentially for free is apparently expensive and having over 4 million tourists using a line which would connect them directly to either the capital of the island and the tourism sector would not be economically sustainable, as well as every person using the clogged-up highway to go to work every day. \n\n2.\"Not enough people would use it.\" Maybe not everyone would use the train, but that is because, in Gran Canaria, we really don't have decent public transport. We are slowly getting there but we still have a very car-centric infrastructure. Being honest, having a train along the most concurred route in the whole island does not seem like a bad idea, taking into account the massive ammount of tourists, too.\n\n3. And this one is painfully stupid, \"It wouldn't be environmentally sustainable.\" Like, how? It is a train and it would be powered by renewables, I know they are not a complete saviour, but we have so many windy days. I really don't know how a \"trustworthy\" institution got to this conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, we don't have a train because we have lazy and blind politicians who only do projects so that they can get a part of the budget. Like they are doing with the MetroGuagua, a BRT system which should have been finished way over 2 years ago but is still 40% complete, and the bike lane network which only exisits in the lower part of the city.",

      "title": "The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand (paper)",
      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

      "text": "Let's try to summarize what we want by a number of postulates. I will edit and add more when they come to mind. Feel free to add in the comments, or if you think it can be better, let me know as well. I want to make a short friendly summary for others to read.\n\nUrbanism postulates:\n\n1. Better cities. Cities without cars or with minimal number of cars are simply better, safer, nicer, quieter etc. City centers, especially historic city centers should be car-free (exception only for services).\n\n2. Safety. Tens of thousands of people die every year being hit by a car. By a simple virtue of there being fewer moving cars while the rest is moving slower we can help that. Next best thing is to have better, non-car-centric infrastructure.\n\n3. Efficiency of space, energy and cost. 2 cars take up as much space as a 50-person bus when travelling at speed, while only being able to carry 10 people and in reality only carrying 2. Bus is also more energy efficient per Capita and puts less wear on the road. In all these statistics a bus is absolutely smoked by a train.\n\n4. Noise pollution. You don't experience it mostly, when in a car, but outside it is bad. It quickly deteriorates mental health when sustained. Can be massively improved by having fewer cars while the remaining travel slower. Electric buses are quieter.\n\n5. Cost. Owning a car is expensive and maintaining car infrastructure is costly and inefficient. Think about it. You can fit a small house in a space the same size as 8 parking spaces. Parking requirements, roads and car-centric development force people to live further away from places of interest, so it takes away other options. It's simply a siphon for oil and car companies to suck money away from people and the government.\n\n6. Energy efficiency and climate crisis. Better and efficient cities, commuting mainly by foot, bike or public transport improves our chances to still have a liveable planet in 50 years.\n\n7. Health. Bike and walking vs car travel. Less cancerous car exhaust pollution. Nuff said. Also mental health improved by less noise pollution, simply nicer cities and less strain on finances.\n\nUrbanism does not postulate:\n\n1. Forcing you out of your cars. We want to first provide options for those who don't want to drive places but currently have to due to lack of other options. These include but are not limited to better bike infrastructure, walkable neighborhoods and good public transit. \n\n2. Inconveniencing drivers out of spite. We don't want to have some kind of revenge on drivers because we are a bunch of douchebags. Currently we are at a huge disadvantage in an event of a crash and culture is not helping. Some Americans for example will blame you if you GET HIT BY A CAR. That is toxic. Physics is against us, therefore we need every help we can get. Streets will again be safer when there is fewer cars and the remaining ones travel slower. Again, second best step is to have safer, people-centric instead of car-centric infrastructure. \n\n3. To take your means of transportation away. NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE YOUR CAR AWAY. We want to provide other options for those who don't want to drive places, but currently have no other options of getting where they need. If you absolutely need to drive regularly due to large distance or cargo amount, that's OK. If you live in a remote rural area where public transport or infrastructure is not feasible, that is also OK. We don't want to punish or shame you if you need to drive.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n1. We are not a bunch of losers who can't drive. Some of us do have our driver's licence, some also sometimes drive on occasion, when necessary. We are not one-sided, we know what the world looks like from behind the wheel. We know what can be reasonably expected from a driver and what can not. Most of us refrain from driving by choice.\n\n2. You will also benefit from there being fewer cars on the road if you need to drive. Yes, seriously. The only group of drivers who we want to shame or punish are lazy dipshits who drive excessively large, dangerous cars in an unsafe manner while having fuel economy worsening mods.",

      "title": "So You Want To Fuck Cars: Running an org, a practical guide",
      "text": "Hey guys, I\u0019m Beli_Mawrr, Sacramento, CA resident and local purveyor of anti-car fuckery. Sorry it's been so long since the last SYWTFC. I figured I'd make this post for Midweek Meme Moratorium, though it seems we've stopped doing that. \n\nEDIT: Image for the thumbnail: https://i.imgur.com/LwlZxAj.png\n\nAnyway, running an org is probably one of the most significant things you can do for urbanism in your area - voting, while important, rarely has the impact you're looking for. Volunteering, in its various forms, will have far greater impact.\n\n***Why?***\n\nPoliticians in small towns are begging to hear opinions from citizens. With an org, those opinions get amplified and focused. You can do things like campaign for or against politicians. You can organize protests if you swing that way. You can do Tactical Urbanism. Whatever it is, it's more effective as an org than as an individual.\n\n# Starting and running orgs \n\n## Recruiting\n\nfor the org I'm a part of, [Sacramento Valley Advocates for a Sustainable Future](https://svasf.org/) it was as simple as making a post for like-minded urbanists here on r/fuckcars, joining the discord, and then our wonderful leader Adrian took matters into his own hands to create the org more officially. \n\nOrgs like /r/CharlotteUrbanists (Calling u/unroja!) have their own subreddit instead of a website and recruit by posting memes. You might consider a social media presence to be critical for organizing - have members post short videos about their experiences on public transit, funny memes, tictacs or whatever you kids are doing these days, that kind of thing. This lets more interested people hear about your org, and ideally participate. Recruitment is a key part of being an org. I've also heard of people putting up posters and signs, it really depends on who you want to engage - an energized and frustrated youth, or experienced, wiser older people.\n\n## Meetings and organization\n\nthe fact is that if an org isn't doing much, it's not an effective org. This means making decisions and talking as a group. I'm not going to try to tell you that orgs have to all agree on everything - you'll never have that! What's important is that you have a defined method of making decisions, whether it be hierarchical or democratic. I won't dwell much on this other than it's necessary to have it written down somewhere.\n\nThis is where many orgs choose to have a charter. A charter is just a paper that defines a lot of features of your org - how are meetings run? How, if at all, are dues collected (More on that later)? Is participation a requirement? What are your goals? Etc.\n\nThere are some key roles in an org, but the leader's job is most important - motivating other members to do stuff. They should be writing down the results of meetings and critically, **follow up and nag until action items are done!**\n\nOne warning for this section. I've heard of and experienced this method of decision making called \"Consensus\" (or unanimity, meaning all members must agree on a stance before progress can be made) - I can tell you from experience it is a disaster waiting to happen. Dissenting members will be emotionally manipulated, bullied, accused of holding up the group, and eventually kicked out so the status quo \"can\" change. Meetings will last days and the status quo will be the unassailable, godlike fact of your existence and your org won't move forward. Don't use Consensus. Do majority!\n\n## Activities you should do\n\nAs an org you have extra power to change things in your community that you wouldn't have as an individual, in fact that's why you do it! As an org, ideally you should be **going to city council meetings**. Depending on how your org \"Swings\" this is probably the most significant thing you can do as an org. The city council should know your name and, if they act in ways counter to the interests of the people, should dread it! Coordinate your speeches to work with one another's. Have counter-points to the NIMBYs who show up (They will!) \n\nYou should organize \"Outreach campaigns\" be that trying to [lobby or persuade](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/twzxjj/so_you_want_to_fuck_cars_how_to_lobby_local/) your politicians, or trying to convince drivers of the other ways that things can be done. Create voting guides by interviewing candidates. Email campaigns are especially powerful. SVASF successfully did a public records request thanks to a particularly diligent and persuasive member, getting evidence of city misconduct. It was very satisfying to see our own names in the emails we uncovered saying that \"You better be sure of this because we're catching a lot of flak for it!\" \n\nI won't go too deep into tactical urbanism, but it can be a great way to affect direct change on the community. I've had city council members stonewall me until I say \"Look, just say we can and we'll do it ourselves\". Check out r/tacticalurbanism for details - the mod there runs a great (if somewhat small) community. Just be aware if you do things without the city council approval you're \"Vandalizing\" to my great frustration.  \n\n## Legality and accounting\n\n-  this will be for the US only, sorry! -\n\nNow I don't want to go too deep into this because I'm neither an accountant nor a lawyer, but my understanding is that if you want to be certain kinds of organizations, you need to be a part 501 3 c org, which has specific ways of collecting funds, and must be subject to a very annoying and expensive yearly audit, and may not be political, so maybe being a 5013c is probably not the best route. Just be aware that there are laws surrounding how organizations accept donations, how they can be used, and what accounting must be done - it might be (look this up!) better to accept dues instead of donations.\n\nA friend of mine recommends we create \"Hybrid PACs\" Instead of 5013c orgs, and also says \"Do not file as an LLC if you intend to have volunteers. That is illegal\"\n\n## TL;DR:\n\nOrgs help you achieve urbanist goals. Recruiting is important, as is outreach and lobbying. Run your org legally and effectively.\n\nAnyway, I hope that helps you start and run an org! Good luck out there!",

Exhibits and attractions are surrounded by sustainable landscaping and are accessible by foot - same could be done for office complexes, grocery markets, restaurants. Replacing main roads with small networks of interconnected multimodal paths and including light rail to connect major districts, with larger-scale passenger rail networks between towns or as access to larger cities seems to me like the absolute ideal scenario.\n\nJust imagine if your community looked like the zoo!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/agx98kfjm2x81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65320bf662d79acc7983f38f3188664b6ebb2c2",

I even carry reusable mesh produce bags with me for all my veggies. When I check out I just have them put my groceries directly back in my cart. That way I can divide up my groceries some what evenly in my panniers on my bike.\n\nThis isn't sustainable and basically just a good choice for hermits and the disabled.

      "title": "\"The car is driving us completely crazy\"",
      "text": "&gt;Following is a translated conversation from September 2007 with transport scientist Hermann Knoflacher who even in the hayday of the car saw it's destructive potential and did his best to minimize it. While a bit long it's definitely worth it. He is an OG! \n\n*DIE ZEIT: Do you reject the car?*\n\nHermann Knoflacher: I don't reject the car. But I am aware of what it means for our society.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you drive a car yourself?*\n\nKnoflacher: I don't own one, but I do drive myself from time to time.\n\n*ZEIT: What influence does motorization have on our society?*\n\nKnoflacher: An incredible influence. The car is like a virus that takes root in the brain and totally reverses the code of conduct, value system and perception. A normal person would describe our current living space as totally insane! We retreat more or less voluntarily into sealed houses with soundproof windows to leave the outside space to the noise, dust and exhaust fumes of the cars. That's a complete reversal of values that we don't even notice anymore.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you think this came about?*\n\nKnoflacher: Our problem is the upright gait. We need a relatively large amount of muscle and control energy to stabilize our bodies. Think of the difficulty of movement under the influence of alcohol. In the car, we use only one-sixth of our body energy and have the impression of being insanely fast and strong. That is one component. The other is the requirement for urban planning to accommodate the car in close proximity to all activities. In doing so, one destroys the natural habitat, public transport, local supply and ultimately also the social network that man has built up over thousands of years.\n\n*ZEIT: The car destroys evolution?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, but the human achievements of the last generations have been destroyed by the car.\n\n*ZEIT: Does the age of the car mean our cultural downfall?*\n\nKnoflacher: I wouldn't say that, because in my opinion cultural decline is not really a problem. It is only a very late evolutionary layer that is breaking away. Much worse are the ongoing structural destructions caused by the car.\n\n*ZEIT: Is driving an addiction?*\n\nKnoflacher: Absolutely! The car takes possession of people. After all, the car driver is more different from the human being than any insect.\n\n*ZEIT: What do you mean by that?*\n\nKnoflacher: Insects have in common with humans that they manage mobility with their own bodily energy. Drivers don't have to. And there are no insects that destroy the habitat of their offspring out of convenience or move so fast that they kill themselves in the process.\n\n*ZEIT: How mobile do you think a society should be?*\n\nKnoflacher: Every society must be mobile in order to satisfy its needs. If we could fulfill all our needs locally, we would be plants, not people. Human mobility always arises as a result of a local deficiency.\n\n*ZEIT: Why are we proud of our mobility?*\n\nKnoflacher: You are talking about technical mobility. Historically, we were by no means proud of mobility per se. On the contrary, mobility was always a ballast. Becoming sedentary meant liberation from forced mobility. One was mentally mobile enough to know how to grow plants and domesticate animals.\n\n*ZEIT: Is that why terms like gypsy or tramp are swear words?*\n\nKnoflacher: It's clear: the sedentary have conquered their territory and denied entry to anyone else. Sedentarism works on the principle of exclusivity. The nomads dispute the sedentary people's spatial resources and are hated for it.\n\n*ZEIT: You are a critic of transportation and at the same time a planner. How\ndoes that fit together?*\n\nKnoflacher: At the beginning of my career, I discovered that traditional transportation is based on mere assumptions. For a long time, the consequences for society or ecology were not even considered. No one paid attention to whether noise or exhaust problems would arise, whether people would die, whether the economy would be changed, or whether unemployment would be created. My goal is to put transportation planning on a scientific basis. From this point of view, I consider transportation to be one of the most exciting scientific fields that currently exist.\n\n*ZEIT: You criticize the lack of networking between transport planning and\nother disciplines.*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes. The core theses of transportation are, in my opinion, completely wrong! The idea of mobility growth is based on an incomplete view of the system. It was assumed that mobility would increase as motorization increased. In the meantime, however, we know that only the number of car trips is increasing, but the total number of trips made remains the same, because trips by public transport and walking are decreasing at the same time. The second false assumption is that of saving time by increasing speed. This thesis forms the basis of many economic efficiency calculations in transportation planning. In fact, there is no time saving by higher speeds. Only the distances increase for the same travel time.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you prove something like that?*\n\nKnoflacher: By taking a critical look at the human time budget. Interestingly, the time spent daily on mobility is more or less constant around the globe. However, the distances covered vary. In the 1960s, the philosopher Ivan Illich demonstrated that the amount of energy humans invest in the car and its associated infrastructure would be sufficient to cover the same distance on foot - and in a much nicer and quieter environment. We know that higher speeds don't save any real time!\n\n*ZEIT: But doesn't a society's mobility increase when it covers greater\ndistances?*\n\nKnoflacher: No. Quite the opposite. The additional distance is pointless. Man covers the greater distances to satisfy the same needs as before. He does the same thing as before, only he travels farther to do it.\n\n*ZEIT: But we are expanding our horizons.*\n\nKnoflacher: How is the horizon supposed to expand if I speed past my surroundings at 100 kilometers per hour? You narrow your horizon extremely because of the fast movement!\n\n*ZEIT: You perceive different things when you go on vacation to India instead\nof Bavaria.*\n\nKnoflacher: It doesn't depend on where you go, but what you discover there. You don't experience more on a well-trodden tourist path in India than in Bavaria. On the contrary, with vigilance and curiosity, you can discover things in Bavaria that you won't find in India. Speeds, which exceed our evolutionary grown possibilities, also exceed our perception. We are not mentally able to cope with the distances that we have made technically possible.\n\n*ZEIT: But we feel powerful.*\n\nKnoflacher: Of course. Mobility always means power. Studies show, by the way, that parents do not consider their own children when they have to choose between a parking space in front of their front door and a traffic-calmed zone. The restriction of movement, even the danger of death for their own offspring, is consciously accepted when it comes to finding the closest possible parking space.\n\n*ZEIT: Is driving a car completely crazy?*\n\nKnoflacher: Considering the conditions that man has created for himself for his car, driving a car is clearly the most pleasant form of mobility and therefore quite rational. In comparison, just look at the movement infrastructure of pedestrians. Sidewalks in their current form are a joke! In the past, pedestrians were allowed to occupy the entire street surface - for 7000 years! Over the last 50 years we have marginalized the pedestrian and wonder why this form of mobility is disappearing. We have built structures that force people to drive!\n\n*ZEIT: Are we living in a dictatorship of car drivers?*\n\nKnoflacher: Absolutely!\n\n*ZEIT: Can this be changed?*\n\nKnoflacher: Of course. It would be enough to change the organization of parking spaces. If, on your way to park your car, you pass a public transport stop or a store - which would automatically locate itself - the need to drive would decrease. These days, you torture people with symptom heresy. You collect a little parking fee here, a little toll there. That's totally unfair. First you build structures that encourage people to use their cars, and then you charge them. As a planner, you have to create transportation structures that free people from the compulsion to drive!\n\n*ZEIT: That sounds like a job full of conflict.*\n\nKnoflacher: At the time, people predicted that my idea of making Kärntnerstrasse in Vienna a pedestrian zone would mean its economic death. Later, I was told that cycling was completely unattractive to the Viennese and that speeding up public transport by paving stops would cause an uprising among car drivers. Supposedly, everything was unpopular. Yet the Viennese embraced these ideas, and the city's quality of life has risen in international rankings. You can't always just satisfy voters' wishes. After all, you don't give tax-free drugs to drug addicts, although this wish would certainly exist.\n\n*ZEIT: In your opinion, can the problem be solved through the price of\ngasoline?*\n\nKnoflacher: No! Any increase in the price of gasoline is a purely symptomatic treatment and automatically leads into the social trap. If only the rich can afford gasoline and the poor can't, the traffic problem remains unsolved, and a social injustice is added. You have to start with the parking space and the way to get there. If parking space is organized properly, car-free areas with a high quality of life will be created. Those who want to sleep peacefully will just have to walk further to the car. And those who prefer the car have to live where it is noisy and smelly. Car parking spaces must be organized in the same way as public transport stops.\n\n*ZEIT: You advocate more parking bans?*\n\nKnoflacher: There you see how car-indoctrinated you think. If pedestrians are forbidden to cross a street where they want to, that is quite normal. A reorganization of traffic zones into pedestrian and car areas is demonized as a ban on cars, without thinking about the fact that this separation offers the best solution.\n\n*ZEIT: What about the much-vaunted freedom of the motorist?*\n\nKnoflacher: That is a purely virtual freedom that is sold via advertising. An empty country road is shown in beautiful surroundings, with a single car speeding around. If the reality of traffic with traffic jams were shown, no one would be stupid enough to buy a car.\n\n*ZEIT: Cars still sell very well.*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes, because car drivers also enjoy another kind of freedom, a legal freedom. Unlike everyone else, they are allowed to make noise and pollute the environment and endanger public safety with impunity. A rampaging drunk will be arrested for noise pollution, motorists who blast our homes at all hours of the day and night will be accepted. If I were to spray carcinogenic substances as a pedestrian with a can, it would be against the law. Thousands of car drivers do this every day without hindrance and shorten the lifespan of all of us by an average of twelve years.\n\n*ZEIT: The car driver is a killer?*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes, but not out of malicious intent. The car puts us into a space-time structure of irresponsibility that we can neither comprehend nor cope with. And it has a strong lobby: The car industry, the construction industry, even the banks that grant loans for car purchases, take great care to ensure that studies like the one just mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) are not published.\n\n\n*ZEIT: Even teenagers dream of cars.*\n\nKnoflacher: Because they have experienced years of lack of freedom by riding in them. A child's mobility is radically restricted by the car. They are not allowed to walk to or across the street, they are not allowed to play everywhere, they are locked into the narrow rear of a car for hours on end, and they are also strapped in. Clearly, teens can't wait to regain their freedom with a driver's license and a car of their own.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you think cars cause wars?*\n\nKnoflacher: One hundred percent! And you don't even have to look at Iraq. Here, too, there is a permanent war. In Austria, two people are killed on the road every day. Traffic causes physical damage to 40,000 people every year. And that doesn't even include those who die as a result of exhaust fumes, according to the WHO.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you feel when you drive past suburban shopping centers,\nfurniture markets and similar facilities?*\n\nKnoflacher: They are parasites! I feel sorry for any city with such structures. After all, the traffic problem is, among other things, a child of such shopping centers and furniture stores on the outskirts of the city. The main problem is the huge free parking spaces. They should be taxed so heavily that parking there costs the same as in the city center. Everyone should be allowed to build where they want, but it can't be right that business people in the city centers have to struggle with parking fees while everything is provided for free on the outskirts.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you think that in ten years Europe's cities will look like the much\nderided U.S. cities with their extensive suburban single-family zones, huge\nshopping centers and few public transportation options?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, because reurbanization is currently taking place in many cities in Europe. This also has to do with the aging of the population. Old people can't get the service on the outskirts of the city that they get in the center. They simply have to return to the city. Apart from that, the energy issue will force people to move back to the cities.\n\n*ZEIT: You mean the price of gasoline?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, I mean the price of energy in general. This will certainly increase and have a decisive impact on all areas of life. This applies to heating, power supply, transportation - and all of this has a much greater impact in terms of insulation in a single-family home on the outskirts of town than in the city center. And older people need many energy-intensive services that become very expensive when prices rise. I'm not just thinking of \"meals on wheels\" or similar services. The more sprawled people live, the more energy is required. And we will soon no longer be able to afford that. That means we have to create sustainable urban structures now in order to be able to finance the future. Because the current cities with their marginal settlements are definitely not that.\n\n*ZEIT: Is it true that the social costs of mobilization are higher than the\nprofits, which include jobs in the automotive industry?*\n\nKnoflacher: That is absolutely true. And the bill will get even worse for consumers, because at the moment mobility is more or less free, and that will soon change dramatically.\n\n*ZEIT: Why are air travelers now suddenly being criticized in relation to\nmobility and climate protection, and not car drivers?*\n\nKnoflacher: First of all, the harmful effects of air travel are not insignificant and the criticism is justified. This is also due to the fact that low-cost airlines activate passenger groups that would otherwise not be found in air travel. Basically, flying is the most degrading form of transportation of all. Flying always reminds me of factory farming: chickens in a laying battery being fed off. Unlike the people on the plane, at least the chickens are not strapped in.\n\n&gt; Professor Hermann Knoflacher has been teaching at the Institute of Transport Planning and Traffic Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology for more than 30 years. The 67-year-old became known for his concepts for Vienna. He developed pedestrian zones, put streetcars on tracks and proposed a network of cycle paths.\n\nThanks to /u/Alexander_Selkirk for posting it to /r/fahrrad and DeepL for translating.",

      "text": "I am posting here because I feel like the people in this sub may understand or be able to offer some wise words. I saw some WEF30 conspiracy theorists commenting on an insta post about sustainability on climate lockdown and how 15 min cities are tyranny, so I wrote a civilised response (no insults just explaining) on why walkable cities are a good thing, how cars have a significant contribution to climate change (in the UK last year transport was the highest emitting sector (more than energy) with road transport the VAST majority of it) and how 15 min cities can be implemented without surveillance. And there were many responses. Basically no one listened, they said things like I am naive, or dumb, or responded with clown emojis, or saying that I am the type of person \"they\" want to manipulate, or that it is just the corporations pollution. It has been 2 days and I still get notifications I really want this to stop. This was just on a nice post which made me feel like there are a lot of these conspiracy theorists in the wild. :(\n\nIt makes me sad. I wanted to try to stop disinformation, because I am always learning new things and change, so I thought others will be able to change when they learn more too. But these people are so convinced in their beliefs that despite all the evidence of climate change they believe it is a hoax. \n\nI suppose I will just be told I shouldn't try to communicate with these people. But can I just ask - is it a loud minority or are there really so many of them? I feel very sad. It might be silly, but I'm a shy person and this was really hard for me and now I feel like I want to crawl back into my cube and hide :') Also, even if you think I am being silly for being upset, please be nice because I had enough mean comments for the last few days.",

      "text": "Dear [Recipient],\n\nI am writing to you today to express my strong support for the implementation of bicycle lanes in our city instead of further investment in car infrastructure.\n\nAs you are aware, the transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and our city must take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint. Building more car infrastructure would only perpetuate our reliance on fossil fuels and further exacerbate our already critical climate crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, investing in bicycle lanes would not only reduce our carbon footprint, but also provide numerous other benefits. Bicycle lanes promote physical activity, leading to better public health outcomes, and can also help reduce congestion on our already overcrowded roads. Additionally, bicycle lanes can contribute to a more vibrant and active city life, creating safer and more accessible spaces for all community members.\n\nFurthermore, bicycle infrastructure is often more cost-effective than car infrastructure. Building bicycle lanes requires less space and resources, leading to lower costs for taxpayers. Additionally, studies have shown that cities with strong bicycle infrastructure have seen significant economic benefits, including increased property values and higher retail sales.\n\nIt is my hope that you will consider these factors when making decisions about transportation infrastructure in our city. I urge you to support the implementation of bicycle lanes in our city as a sustainable, cost-effective, and equitable transportation solution.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. \n\nSincerely,\n[Name]",

      "text": "I think something that isn't talked about enough in this sub is that most people in North America use cars not because they want to but because they need to. And that in order to solve the former we need to solve the latter. \n\nMost NA cities are planned around low-density housing and there are strict zoning laws that keep it this way. NIMBYs (both on the political right and left) oppose any new housing developments especially those with high density living. This has caused a terrible housing crisis in both Canada and the US. Housing costs both to rent and to purchase have skyrocketed and the amount of people who are homeless and underhoused has reached critical levels. \n\nDense housing is the key to creating a sustainable car-reduced/car-free world. Housing is the key to making transit networks viable. Transit without densitification has very little use (look at Long Island) and is a subsidy to the rich. \n\nWe can no longer allow conservative NIMBYs to use bigotry, \"property values\", fear of change to stop us from building. We can no longer allow left NIMBYs to concern troll over gentrification, the environment or \"developer profits\" to stop new housing. \n\nWe cannot allow more gas lighting from people who claim there is no housing shortage, who want to blame everything on greedy corporations buying up all the housing stock or who because of ideological reasons deny the realities of supply and demand. We can no longer entertain people who decry \"luxury\" housing. We can no longer entertain people that want to overthrow capitalism before a single person gets housed. These ideas are all wrong and counterproductive to building more housing. \n\nWe need to fix our housing crisis and actually house people. Everyday someone needs sleeps on the street or a friends couch because they cannot afford a home is a tragedy.\n\nBuild dense housing and the car-free/car-reduced walkable utopia you seek will follow.\n\n**Please join the YIMBY movement and go advocate for more housing in your city.**",

      "title": "Rant: why I often feel frustrated about North American urbanists.",
      "text": "I needed to let off some steam earlier so I wrote the following post earlier today; I intended to post it much earlier but it probably needed some revision anyways. So here is my pitch: if I could ask one question to all North American urbanists and people in NA who follow city planning, it'd be just four words. \"Where is your rage?\" If I was allowed to ramble for a longer period than that, it'd probably be this post. I'm sorry for the rant.\n\nSo the question is this: where is the rage for a city being torn apart by massive roads and highways that pollute it to nobody's business? Where is the rage for a city still building historically classist and systematically racist developments to this day? Where is the rage when homeless people must live between poorly maintained railroad tracks and a golf course for the wealthy?\n\nSacramento. That's the name of a city that's brought me far too much stress recently. Sacramento's done this to no end and aims to continue doing this. The city destroyed its Japantown to build a park just for the Capitol Building. It carved through and separated its oldest part of town with a massive interstate highway. It gutted its once-robust streetcar system for three LRT lines that really don't quite cut it.\n\nThese actions were often done to appeal to the car and with the wealthy in mind.\n\nToday, it aims to widen I-80, I-5, US-50, and CA-99... so you know... pretty much every fully-separated highway it has authority over. It's building new isolated single-family developments far from anything else, as are all its satellite cities and suburbs. It's torn out large swaths of natural space in the name of \"flood control\" (which they've failed at many times before, and residents have said has worsened since). And nearly everything that exists outside about a half square mile city center just... looks like this:\n\n[El Camino Avenue @ Yorktown Avenue looking east via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/7hyv1fxehe5d1.png?width=1409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2cbcfe05e3eecf5b1abc7ec0f05a5fcdc44724)\n\nTo be quite frank, I'm exhausted with this place. It is lost in the 1960s with no plan to exit this hellscape that it has created. It plans on widening those highways because it indeed expects to build even more places like this - places where you have to drive just to go literally anywhere because walking is impossibly slow, difficult, and dangerous.\n\nAs you can see, I'm an obnoxious winge-fest about this place because I have to live near it all. I've only just become an adult and I've got no job - here's to hoping - so I'm landed here for the foreseeable future. This is the view I see of the city.\n\n=\n\nI think people don't like negativity. This makes sense, because avoiding constant negativity and hate and anger is healthy, and people who are always negative are also often very miserable. Additionally, I firmly believe that positivity towards positive actions done by cities is a vital aspect to urbanists' advocacy. When a city does something that will improve its quality of life, sustainability, and health, that should absolutely be applauded. I also know that small things matter and that small steps are required to get on the right track. And on top of that, I get that perspective changes how you view a place.\n\nI've been told that I should be grateful for living in Sacramento. After all, I have a roof over my head. I don't have to cycle 10 miles down winding midwest country roads with not even a painted bike gutter to get to the nearest grocery store. And while that is a valid perspective and I am glad for the little things about where I am vs where I could be, it's extremely hard for me to personally digest this response. I should be grateful for... this??\n\n[Yorktown Avenue @ El Camino Avenue, looking west down El Camino via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/wdsihfwajg5d1.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c23fe583cf7a5cbda4be53f68c8fc7783ec8579)\n\nWhen people's reactions to my complaints about a place like this is to say \"be grateful, cause it could be worse,\" that just shows how utterly dystopian this part of the world is. It not only doesn't console me but it makes me even more upset knowing that *THIS* is one of the better parts of the continent.\n\nYes, I would rather be here than biking next to racist pro-lifers in lifted F-150s trying to rolling-coal me. I know it's a relative privilege to be able to live in a city that has *some modicum* of safety outside a car. But why is it I feel these folks are telling me I should be *happy* to live in a place like this? That modicum of safety is TINY and  while Sacramento's nowhere near the worst it's still a miserable place people clearly don't care about and just hope to get out of as soon as they can.\n\nIs it a privilege to live in a fairly regular North American car pit?\n\nIt's perspective that leads people to these takes, I know. Some folks are truly roughing it somewhere where they can't even afford a car and have to walk through dumps like this. But that's such a dystopian take. \"Hey buddy, it only goes down from here,\" it says. \"Those are the shining lights. Lovely, ain't they?\"\n\n=\n\nIn my opinion, the positive aspects of a place get disproportionately more positive attention than the negative aspects get negative attention. Sacramento's a great example of this. Downtown is absolutely beautiful. Like. It's called the city of trees for a reason.\n\n[K Street @ 9th looking west via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/9wku9otphe5d1.png?width=1406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233c5c7d21102c77da9541437677f1dd1638bd4e)\n\nLook, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being happy about this place. I'm happy about it. I want to see more of it and I want people to show their approval for places like this. It's just that at least from my perspective it often feels like North American city planning followers will point to places like this and give them showering Urbanist Gold Credits for Doing The Good Street Thing. And again, I want to emphasize that we *should* amp up places like this because these are the type of places we want every place to build.\n\nBut that comes with the caveat that we also do need to remember that this is the little half square mile. Like so many other cities in North America, there's this little world almost separate from the rest where it's actually really nice with lovely old streets and great transit. But that's the key, it's almost a separate world.\n\nIn Sacramento, it's not immediate suburban sprawl hell the moment you step out of that little plot, but it is a place choked by highways and that place quickly deteriorates in quality the further out you go. Additionally, the price of living in downtown Sacramento - while inconsistent and volatile - is pretty hard to justify. People can easily be paying $4k for a *studio*, or almost worse be paying something relatively reasonable but end up in an apartment that has few or no amenities and is practically preparing to fall apart next time an earthquake hits. People shouldn't be stuck somewhere miserable or stung for something just livable.\n\nAnd the areas outside downtown are just. 1960s American suburban art, in the derogatory sense. If anyone's still reading this, have you watched the movie adaptation of *A Wrinkle in Time*? Bit of a spoiler but there's a scene where everything's been tailor-made to be identical to everything else, including people and their schedules, and it's a stereotypical American cul-de-sac suburb, and it's *creepy*. Yeah, tell that to Sacramento and its suburbs and they'll take it to the next level by not only making it real but making it even more devoid of life.\n\n[Auburn Boulevard west of Sylvan Road, looking west via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/bs3kb9fuhe5d1.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7dd7e809d5a97acbd60fef75d5281d1390e9a2)\n\nSo yes, the downtown's beautiful, but can you really still say Sacramento's all that good if most of it looks like this, and this is how most Sacramento residents actually experience the city?\n\nWhen I'm told I should be grateful for where I live, this is the lens through which I see it. I almost never get to see downtown. So to be honest, I can't help but look through my lens and say, no, I'm sorry, this is fucking miserable. Frankly, the thing I'm most grateful for is that I know a few things about city planning and can identify that these issues exist.\n\n=\n\nSo why don't I just move out?\n\nWell, let's think of some cities known for their great urbanism in North America.\n\nVancouver! Vancouver's pretty great, it's beautiful, it's in Canada so free healthcare - oh my, the median rent's *$2,950* per month.\n\nToronto! Toronto's not quite in the northeast, but it is close and that area's known for its urbanism and great city pla- $2,650 per month.\n\nSo Canada's a bit of a no-go... how about New York City? I hear it's hands down the best city in North America. Oh wait, that's right, the rent's infamous for being like $10,000 for a tiny little box.\n\nAnd that's the main issue. There are some places with incredible urbanism but to be brutally honest, they're still so fucking unlivable due to the cost of rent alone. I mean, it's San Francisco everywhere!\n\nRemember also that I have no money of my own, so it's not like I can just book a one-way to Chicago.\n\nLet me be a bit aggressive for a moment. \"Just move out\" is one of the laziest, most privilege-lensed, fucked up responses possible.\n\nSo, I should advocate, then, right? But with what platform? Nobody's gonna listen to this random singular person who whines about stroads. And it's also a time and energy investment that brings you right into the heart of the firey pits of American politics. Look, I'm just one person and while I'm sure they're there I've never met anyone else who is as open about the city's planning nightmare. Hell, how long's CAHSR taking even with advocates in favor?\n\nOne of my biggest frustrations is that I always feel like I have absolutely no power in this country. My voice is unheard by everyone but a little group of friends. Honestly, for me, it'd almost be easier to move out, because as far as the government in charge is concerned, I simply don't exist. Telling me to \"just advocate\" completely misses that advocacy only works if people are willing to listen, and frankly, nobody who can do anything about it is.\n\n=\n\nLet me talk for a minute about \"the northeast and Chicago problem\". What's this? Well, it's when North American urbanists champion the same small set of cities that happen to have a pretty significant positive background with city planning already. NYC, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, the Twin Cities.\n\nLook, these cities are wonderful, but most of them are in the wealthiest subset of North America where a massive portion of the continent's economic wealth is concentrated. I get the vibe that people think these places are representative of the whole country. They aren't. The suburbs of Sacramento are a way more accurate depiction of what it's like to live in the United States or Canada. And so I continue feeling my anger towards them.\n\nLook, there's an entire section of interstate that totally flouts the interstate regulations because a town in Pennsylvania didn't want their car tourism to dip. This story of \"please don't remove the cars, we'll lose our tourism\" is almost (not quite, but almost) exclusively North American. The places worse than Sacramento only make me even angrier, because the way the people in power have configured them has created a nightmarish dystopia machine.\n\nI like Chicago and I respect the northeast because these places are truly the royalty of North American city planning for a lot of people and a lot of reasons. But they only represent a tiny bit of the region and most people don't have the privilege of living in these places. Yes, the whole NJB \"give up on America\" thing very clearly came from a place of privilege and was kinda nuts, but the whole \"just move to Philly\" thing is almost on the same tier and I'm just so tired of it.\n\nThe worst part? There are just so many things about even Chicago and NYC that scream \"gutted for the car\" or some other issue like financial deficit or historical racism. An entire black neighborhood was bulldozed to put Central Park in NYC and the city barely even acknowledges it. What about the BQE? That tore New York's neighborhood apart and the city still pays for it dearly.\n\n[Hudson River Greenway by the World Trade Center, NYC, looking south.](https://preview.redd.it/jx89kz34qg5d1.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=107e0b9f74d319e9a027976f6eb9f395a6c2b6f6)\n\nA lot of even New York City is still absolutely bleeding for the mistakes made for the car. Congestion, massive stroads through the urban core, highways cutting off every waterfront. And this is *NEW YORK CITY.*\n\nThere's a lot to love about a lot of places in North America. A lot of places have something that is genuinely very charming about them. I personally love the neighborhood of Fremont in Seattle for its unapologetic weirdness - they even have a statue of Lenin that someone mortgaged their house to bring to Seattle. I can also see the charm in New Orleans's historic cultural prowess and lovely canals that crisscross some of the city. And Sacramento has its lovely street trees. There is lots of charm to be found in even the most roughed-up places.\n\nHowever, that just makes it so much sadder that these places have been almost *buried* in cars. I just can't help but see so much waste, shattered potential, and destroyed city fabric in these places. Why are we still gladly erasing the charm of a bizarrely imported statue or a culture scene so big they name things after and make art all about the city that created it with flavorless stroads with no sidewalks and Camazotzian dystopia cul-de-sacs? Where is the rage for the people whose houses get bulldozed to cram another lane in?\n\n[Looking west down New Orleans's Madrid Street, between Arts and Music Streets, via Google Maps.](https://preview.redd.it/0f924cbjrg5d1.png?width=1383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7436ce2da9dbc4a1af9f32a0fa22f2e7fd9e65ff)\n\n=\n\nI want to see positivity. But I also want to see what places are actually like, and to be honest, even in places known for something truly charming and powerful, the place that once may have been isn't there anymore. I personally think that just because there's something that is generally appealing about a place, doesn't mean it's a good place.\n\nJust because Sacramento has a nice downtown does not mean I should hold back my thoughts about the new single-family exurbs going up left and right.\n\nJust because New Orleans is historic, doesn't mean I'm going to see the appeal given a lens into what the city's actually like.\n\nIf a city is underrated and financially struggling, it's more fuel on the fire against car infrastructure. When Sacramento pours billions into highway widening projects, they're pouring that financial investment down the drain. These decisions are made at best carelessly and at worst still with the intent to make the rich richer, and I will continue to be upset at places like Sacramento for said decisions.\n\n=\n\nAll people deserve better.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to bike 10 miles without any protection to get to a store. People shouldn't have to rely on depreciating assets to get anything done in their lives. People should be able to enjoy a beautiful urban core without having to return home to a rundown apartment next to a highway and a stroad. People deserve to be able to afford mixed-use developments. People deserve not to be kicked out of a place they may already be struggling to pay for just so a polluting, wasteful highway can be blasted right on through their home. People deserve not to suffer for the continued systemic racism and classism of the current, outdated city planning standards still followed by a wide majority of North America.\n\nThis way of doing things is wrong.\n\nSo, I will ask just once more. North America: where is your rage?\n\n=\n\nThank you if you're still tolerating my whining and rambling. I hope you can understand my frustration and perspective. I want to make really clear that I know North America isn't totally silent about this. There are lots of small towns and great groups working to improve on the mistakes that haunt us from the 1960s. But I get very jaded and frustrated so often and I just needed to let this out or I'd itch for eternity. Please feel free to tell of your perspective because perspective matters. And remember: we all want the same thing.

      "title": "Welcome to /r/Fuckcars",
      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion. Additionally, check out these posts from others on this sub:\n\n- [I\u0019m a car enthusiast and I unironically agree with this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/rnwcz7)\n- [I\u0019m a car enthusiast, and this one of my is my favorite subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/tuxdkh/im_a_car_enthusiast_and_this_one_of_my_is_my/)\n- [Am I right here?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/s4her8)\n- [I'm a car guy.

Barcelona\u0019s \u001csuperblocks\u001d programme, which takes sets of nine blocks within its grid system and limits cars to the roads around the outside of the set (as well as reducing speed limits and removing on-street parking) was shaped by having resident input on every stage of the process, from design to implementation. Early indicators suggest the policy has been wildly popular with residents, has seen nitrogen dioxide air pollution fall by 25 percent in some areas, and will prevent an estimated 667 premature deaths each year, saving an estimated 1.7 billion euros.\n\n&gt;When it comes to design, there\u0019s also the question of access. Whether it\u0019s emergency services needing to get in or small businesses awaiting deliveries, there\u0019s an important amount of \u001clast mile\u001d traffic\u0014transport that gets people or things to the actual end point of their journey\u0014that is vital to sustaining an urban area. If you want to reduce traffic, you have to work around that and think of alternative solutions\u0014such as allowing emergency vehicles access to pedestrianized areas, or even using automatic number plate recognition to exempt emergency vehicles from the camera checks that are used to police through-traffic in LTNs (which is what Lambeth is doing, Holland says).\n\n&gt;But even then, it\u0019s often just hard to convince people an entirely different city layout is possible. Getting people to accept that how they live alongside cars can be changed\u0014say, with an LTN\u0014takes time. But government surveys of the UK\u0019s recently implemented LTNs have indicated that support from residents for such schemes increases over time. \u001cIf you start seeing more and more of those kinds of things, things become thinkable,\u001d explains Aldred. If you start unpicking the idea that car use can\u0019t be changed, \u001cit starts to become possible to do more and more things without cars for people.\u001d\n\n&gt;The other issue is that, to put it simply, cars are never just cars. They\u0019re interwoven into our culture and consumption as symbols of affluence, independence, and success, and the aspiration to achieve those things in future. \u001cA man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure,\u001d the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher reportedly once said. \u001cThat\u0019s how we got in this mess in the first place, though,\u001d says Crawford. \u001cEverybody saw that the rich people were driving cars, and they wanted to too.\u001d",

Nobody really knows.\u001d The former US president added that rising sea levels, caused by melting glaciers, would have the benefit of creating \u001cmore oceanfront property\u001d.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk, meanwhile, said it was wrong to \u001cvilify\u001d the oil and gas industry, the key driver of planet-heating pollution, and that the only imperative to ditch fossil fuels was that they will one day run dry.\n\n&gt;\u001cIf we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,\u001d said Musk, who is also chief executive of the electric car company Tesla. \u001cWe do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;\u001cWe still have quite a bit of time & we don\u0019t need to rush and we don\u0019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that. Like, leave the farmers alone.\u001d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk said the main danger of allowing carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere was that at some point it will become difficult to breathe, causing \u001cheadaches and nausea\u001d to people. This would occur with CO2 at about 1,000 parts per million of the Earth\u0019s atmosphere, more than double the current record-breaking concentrations.\n\nTo be clear, this is a problem soon because we're talking about indoor air which needs to be replaced with outdoor air. The higher outdoor CO2 concentration makes that process more difficult. We don't have to wait until the atmospheric levels are 1000 ppm https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000237 \n\nI think this pretty much confirms what we've been saying for years:  electric cars are here to save the car industry, not the planet. \n\n",

      "text": "With the hours of doom scrolling reddit posts on urban planning, suburbs, urban sprawl and public transit one detail sticks out to me; virtually all Americans are conservative on the topic of public transit. \n\nWhenever anyone suggests increasing the use of public transit virtually all Americans become the Koch brothers. People argue on how public transit is bad. From their perspective this isn't wrong necessarily, public transit is bad in the US but is it bad inherently or by design? \n\nPublic transportation is chronically underfunded and an afterthought in most American cities. There are, of course, places that public transit wouldn't really work (such as rural areas). However, in most cities where most Americans live improvements on the local public transit system would make it much more viable and sustainable way to get around.\n\nHowever, when the topic becomes public transit every American becomes a Republican politician under a Democratic Presidency and all of a sudden the costs are incredibly scrutinized.\n\n\"How much is it going to cost?\"\n\n\"Trains are too expensive\"\n\n\"It costs 1 billion per mile for NY subway\" (ignoring the billions spent on roads and highways)\n\n\"How are farmers in Wyoming going to use it\"\n\n\"Public transit sucks. It's dirty, it's slow, it's inefficient\".\n\n\"Poor people? Ew.\"\n\n\"There's serial killers on buses!!!\"\n\nIt's like almost every American becomes a suburban Karen. Instead of realizing that those are the result of bad policies and bad design or that if these policies were improved public transit would improve, they instead throw away the entire concept. \n\nIt's basically the Republican strategy; \n\n1. Say gov't is trash \n\n2. Underfund gov't \n\n3. Gov't is trash \n\n4. Profit.\n\nI think it's interesting because liberals and progressives are able to see beyond this line of reasoning in other areas, such as healthcare, education and the post system. They understand that funding and good policy is essential to getting good results from these public services. However, when it comes to public transportation they aren't able to make this leap. Can you imagine if this logic was consistent through out all policy?\n\n\"My local school system sucks so gov't funded education is bad\"\n\n\"My Obamacare plan sucks so gov't healthcare is bad\"\n\nMost liberals and progressives reject this type of logic when it comes to these issues but will then turn around and spout this:\n\n\"My local bus system sucks so public transportation is bad\". \n\nWhy?",

      "text": "**tl;dr: Carbrains rampaging about having to pay for school busses they don't use, I got upset and wrote a screed about why it's not a bad thing and helps illuminate generally why public transportation is important.**\n\nA recent conversation about dropping or charging additional fees for the bus at our daughter\u0019s school makes a good argument (in my mind) at least why public transportation should be subsidized.  I don\u0019t know if I\u0019ll be brave enough to share it with the other families there, but we\u0019ll see ... I suspect that their angry posts on Whatsapp will fall on deaf ears, and I shouldn't feed the trolls.  But I had to write it.  But for this community, any thoughts on how to improve the argument or whether I should share it?\n\nAn argument that we heard from those who drive their kids to school was: \\`\\`It\u0019s not fair that the general school budget pays for kids to ride the bus, the cost of riding the bus should fall entirely on those who ride it.\u0019\u0019\n\nThe counterargument that I would make is that there are benefits to drivers from those riding the bus, but they are perhaps hard to see.  They are, in my mind: less congestion on the roads, a commitment to the environment, and a more welcoming school.  I\u0019ll talk about each of them individually first and then connect it back to how the same argument applies to society generally.\n\nEveryone at the school complains about how dangerous and crowded the dropoff area is in the morning: ending the bus program or making it more expensive would encourage more people to drive to school.  The facilities there are already pushed to the limit; disinvesting from the bus would mean having to spend even more money on parking lots and traffic control (I\u0019ll point out that bus riders are subsidizing the parking lots with *their* tuition & I would hope that they begin charging those who drive for parking and for road maintenance if everyone needs to pay their fare share).    \n\nLikewise, the school likes to crow about how green it is, going so far as to install solar panels.  But if the school legitimately wants to reduce its carbon footprint, getting *more* students riding the bus is the most immediate and cost-effective way to accomplish those goals.  Moreover, the school is in tension with its neighbors; more traffic on Chateau drive will make the local leaders less likely to be okay with future school expansion (which is a stated goal) even if it has the road capacity to handle more students.\n\nAnd there are some families for whom it is easier to drive their kids to school than for others.  The bus could be the difference between them attending or not.  Their parents might not be able to drive because they lack the ability to drive (e.g., because of health reasons, as afflicted our family recently, thankfully temporarily), because of work obligation, or because they live in a part of the city where it doesn\u0019t make sense to own a car (or multiple cars).  Those students might well disappear entirely from the school if the bus becomes unaffordable or unavailable.\n\nAnd all of these apply generally to society as well: less public transportation means more traffic and more money spent on roads, there is a very high cost to giving away free parking, public transportation and walkable communities are the best path toward a carbon neutral future, and public transportation makes people who would otherwise not be a part of society able to participate.\n\nAnd sadly, what I expect will happen at the school is that the subsidy will likely disappear and that\u0014like many American public transportation options\u0014it will enter a death spiral: the service will be cut back, it will cease to be a reliable option for many, the per-rider costs will soar, and then it will cease to be sustainable, leading to cancellation entirely.  And I believe that this will leave the school worse off: more traffic, a less diverse student body, and less sustainable. ",

      "text": "I finally understand the purpose of this sub as when I was biking around a car came out of nowhere and hit me while I was in a crosswalk. Thankfully, I didn't sustain any major injury due to how (relatively) slow we were both going. My bike (which we just got back from the shop), on the other hand, is completely broken and will likely have to be thrown away.\n\nEdit: I appreciate all the engagement this post has gotten, so I think I should clarify a bit more. The place I was biking was a fair distance away from my home, meaning I didn't know anybody I could reliably seek help from. I made sure to stick to the sidewalks and always use crosswalks (which was where the collision occurred) anyway to be safe. Also, it's labelled as a \"historic\" village, meaning it's full of old-timey people. I'm not saying it's impossible it was caught on camera, but the odds are slim to none. There were a few witnesses as well, but none of them stopped me or the driver to give us any sort of information. As much as I would love to take the driver to court, I don't think I have enough information to serve as reasonable evidence. It's really unfortunate but I don't believe there's much I can do.",

      "text": "I'm 17, graduating high school next month, and have never had the desire to learn to drive. I ride my bike to school every day and mostly to everywhere else, and I'm extremely content with doing so. I'm going to community college right across the street from my high school, so my upcoming commute won't be any different in terms of distance. After I get my associates I plan on going to a university in western Europe, in an urban city where I will most likely not need to rely on a car either for my daily life. Already, that will be 5-6 years of not having an urgent or consistent need to drive a car. So based on my lifestyle and future plans, getting a drivers license is not really at the top of my list of priorities for the near future.\n\nMy family on the other hand, more so my older relatives, are very judgmental and think I'm being immature and childish. Because to them, driving a car = being an adult. Even though I am incredibly self-reliant and independent already without needing to drive a car. I do great in school, and I've never been rebellious or anything as a teen, so I'm honestly offended that my family is upset with me because of this. I am proud to be a bicyclist; to me it represents staying true to my values, beliefs, and passions.\n\nNot only do I actually enjoy riding my bike, but I honestly feel guilty every time I'm in a car. Because of the CO2 it emits as well as the overall city infrastructure that driving encourages, which is not very sustainable or even pleasant from my experience. I don't want to dedicate my time learning a skill that I don't want to learn, nor do I think I will use. My parents have also always struggled financially, so I honestly don't know why they want me to drive and spend more money on gas, etc.! Riding my bike costs nothing. \n\nI don't think I am being childish or immature. I think I am making a reasonable, mature, and individualistic decision for myself. Why is riding a bike instead of driving seen as less than? Do you think biking labels people? or brands them, like as people who are \"eco freaks\" or less wealthy, etc. Maybe that's why my family wants me to drive :/\n\n In my opinion, choosing to ride a bike when you have the opportunity to drive is a brave and bold decision, one that I respect.",

It happens to be the most sustainable way of living and financially very advantageous.\n\nI have access to high paying jobs and spend close to nothing on transportation (maybe a few hundreds per year in bike maintenance and transit fare). I also pay very little in utilities because apartment buildings are inherently efficient so I hardly pay anything in heating bills and fees.\n\nGroceries have become marginally more expensive but this is the same for people living in the countryside. The only thing I spend more on is rent but it scales with salaries and job opportunities in a way that I come up ahead anyway I look at it.\n\nI feel very fortunate. I have close to zero liability as it\u0019s very unlikely I will cause significant damage to someone or something while walking or cycling. My health benefits from the daily exercise and I hardly ever had to get medical attention - costs here are kept to a minimum.\n\nBut&\n\nThat lifestyle is seen as the lifestyle of a looser, or a freak. Almost everyone in my social circles wonder what I\u0019m doing. My kiddo has other schoolchildren berate him because we are \u001cpoor\u001d because we don\u0019t have a car.\n\nMy friends either moved to the suburbs to buy single family houses or dream about it. I don\u0019t know what to tell them and resent the distance (both physical and societal) that it places between us.\n\nI *could* buy a house outside of the city and I *could* buy a fancy car, I just don\u0019t want to.\n\nIt\u0019s not that I really care about other people\u0019s judgment but it does exclude me even tacitly from a big part of society. And this is in a city with about 40% of car-free households. I can\u0019t imagine how worse it must be anywhere else.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading that nonsense. Have a great day.",

Employees flying in are told not to rent a car, but we are responsible for our own transportation to/from the hotel, the office, an offsite happy hour and an offsite lunch. The offsite lunch is for teams to get together separately and we have to choose where we go. There are half a dozen decent restaurants nearby but they are all across a major road that has no crosswalks. I have more than 5 people. I am going to have to request 2 separate Ubers to take people ACROSS THE STREET for lunch. Also it takes 10+ minutes to get an Uber out there. \n\nThe people that plan the party are local so of course have no concept of how inconvenient this plan is and how wasteful it is to have chosen a location for the event so far from civilization. I know they don\u0019t mean to make it difficult but good GRACIOUS can\u0019t people imagine what it might be like not to have a car? Especially when they are actually forcing people to be without it since they won\u0019t pay for it. Unlike me, most people *do* have cars but wont have them during their event. One of their only exposures to living car free only shows them how difficult it is. \n\nThe kicker is we purport to be a \u001csustainable\u001d company. Oh my god i\u0019m so pissed.",

Does this sound sustainable? Is either one of us delusional?\n\nThanks so much for your providing us with the resources necessary to make me realize I'm not that crazy...

I would not consider myself part of the left but would definitely consider myself anti-car. I think it is very important to highlight that this movement is actually bipartisan and an excellent opportunity for both sides of the aisle to work together.\n\nMany of the arguments this movement makes center around left-leaning causes such as sustainability, and social justice; however, I believe many people on the right side of the spectrum overlook the conservative arguments this movement makes. This movement goes hand-in-hand with the urbanist movement which promotes communalism, traditional urban design, and local governance; all of which are conservative values. There are even people here who argue that the best method of solving car-domination is to eliminate zoning controls and promote a laissez-faire urban development model, again a right-leaning argument. Additionally, I don't see too many people on the right arguing for the elimination of government monopolies on things such as water and electricity utilities, yet many conservatives would get up in arms over nationalizing railroads, despite them being a natural monopoly like other utilities.\n\nMy concluding point here is that this movement is not a partisan movement and will benefit everyone if its goals are allowed to be achieved. Conservatives and other people on the right should not be scared of this movement and should take the Orange Pill.",

And even there you see how much predominant cars are in the daily life. Modal share of cars is always above 60% inside cities, even those with high bike usage. Cities in Austria and Germany average 30-40%.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on why this is, also who visited the country?\n\nItalians are car slaves like the US with a very different GDP. These are my thoughts.\n\n1. car culture was brought into politics, and  being very inefficient and unstable never actually cared to make national plans to increase sustainable modal shares\n2. local administrations don't limit car parking enough even in walkable and cycling friendly cities, there's still the idea that parking is a \"right\"\n3. 2. leads to a lot of illegal parking (cause the space is not enough) and those are tolerated by everyone, both citizens and local police\n4. lack of transit networks, seen as \"for the poor\", Italy has the lowest rate of subways and trams density, they \"invested\" all into buses which are usually stuck in car traffic and with a limited service, usually for those unfortunate to not have a car (lower income people and students)\n5. outside the city centers (the LTZs) urban quality is generally very poor, anti-pedestrians and anti-cyclists, places you're not really invited to be in, just to pass by (with a car)\n6. cycling infrastructure is simply ridiculous, even those cities that have pretty decent high cycling share are poorly maintained, shared with pedestrians, not connected together or end when they're actually needed (always based on the idea that cars are more important and you should not disturb them), the only exception are maybe cities in South Tyrol like Bozen/Bolzano.\n7. the current Minister of Transportation is about to make things worse: he proposed a law where speed checkers will not longer will be legal inside cities within 50km/h and suburban roads within 90km/h, which is basically 95% of the roads, limit the autonomy of local administration to build bike lanes and pedestrians areas and much more. A direct attack to livable cities policies. The same minister also sued the city of Bologna for now being a 30km/h city (using the safety guidelines he signed years before, yeah...) check this short [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ETrxEpUymKM](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ETrxEpUymKM)",

      "text": "Hey, y'all! I'm an independent journalist based in Austin, Texas. I cover housing and transportation for Bloomberg CityLab, *Texas Monthly*, and *The New York Times*. And I'm the author of new book, [City Limits: Infrastructure, Inequality, and the Future of America's Highways](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711708/city-limits-by-megan-kimble/).\n\nEvery major American city has a highway tearing through its center. Seventy years ago, planners sold these highways as progress, essential to our future prosperity. The automobile promised freedom, and highways were going to take us there. Instead, they divided cities, displaced people from their homes, chained us to our cars, and locked us into a high-emissions future. And the more highways we built, the worse traffic got. Nowhere is this more visible than in Texas. In Houston, Dallas, and Austin, residents and activists are fighting against massive, multi-billion-dollar highway expansions that will claim thousands of homes and businesses, entrenching segregation and sprawl.  \n   \n*City Limits* covers the troubling history of America\u0019s urban highways and the battle over their future in Austin, Dallas, and Houston, following residents who risk losing their homes and businesses to planned expansions and examining successful highway removals in cities like Rochester, New York, to argue that we must dismantle these city-splitting roadways to ensure a more just, sustainable future.\n\nMore about the book here: [https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711708/city-limits-by-megan-kimble/](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711708/city-limits-by-megan-kimble/) \n\nAnd me, here: [https://www.megankimble.com](https://www.megankimble.com) &amp; https://twitter.com/megankimble  \n   \nAsk me anything!

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

      "text": "Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:\n\n**\u001cMy emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d**\n\nThis is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth\u0019s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t afford an electric car.\u001d**\n\nNo one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There\u0019s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\u001d**\n\nYou *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dDriving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nCommute times should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cThere\u0019s no infrastructure to bike where I live.\u001d**\n\nAny road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThe infrastructure isn\u0019t ready yet.\u001d**\n\nWe don\u0019t have time: not only is our planet\u0019s climate destabilizing, it\u0019s destabilizing quickly. We can\u0019t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it\u0019s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.\n\n**\u001cMy workplace is out of reach of biking distance.\u001d**\n\nConsider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can\u0019t, then consider finding another job that\u0019s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn\u0019t be the priority when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI\u0019m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.\u001d**\n\nUnless you\u0019re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t carry my groceries on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThere\u0019s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t ride a bike in the cold.\u001d**\n\nWear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cNot everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThen go for an adult tricycle instead. Don\u0019t set that option aside so quickly when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThere wouldn\u0019t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.\u001d**\n\nIf more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet\u0019s climate from destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t like waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nBring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI don\u0019t like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d**\n\nComfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dHow can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\u001d**\n\nAre you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?\n\n**\u001dYour use of a device that\u0019s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we\u0019re focusing on.\n\n**\u001d[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.\n\nThe bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren\u0019t insignificant at all. You can\u0019t shift the blame on \u001ccorporations\u001d or \u001cinfrastructure\u001d when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.\n\nEDITS:\n\nIt turns out r/fuckcars has *way* more car apologists hiding among its members than one would expect!\n\nDrinking game!

      "title": "This sub broke my 12 year lurk. Fuck em! Trains and bikes rule, cars drool.",
      "text": "Ah! As the title states, I just broke my 12 year lurking streak to create an account to subscribe to this sub.\n\nI\u0019ve been lurking since 2010, back when it was mostly great memes, casually scrolling the front page. I know the time suck of Reddit without an account so I never wanted to make one and dive further in.\n\nBut I just saw this sub on the front page for the first time and Ah! My people! I\u0019ve found you! I just about shit myself when I found the unofficial directory post of other similar communities. \n\nI grew up in pretty rural town, Red Lodge, MT. It\u0019s all cars out in MT but that\u0019s cool because there\u0019s a lot of space out here. \n\nI went to University in Eugene Oregon, and they have a stellar bike path and decent public transportation system. It was here where I started to notice how convenient and efficient biking and public transit is. There\u0019s a bike path along the entire river in the city, and many bike specific bridges crossing it. How cool. \n\nAfter University I moved to Daegu, South Korea to teach English. This is where the lid was blown off. The biking and public transit in this city was AMAZING! Life changing. My perspective changed and it can never change back. I had a subway stop on my street that put you right into the subway network. Getting around the city was a breeze. I never even had to explore the extensive bus system because the subway (and autonomous light rail) was so effective. Best part? This subway system would connect to the train system and then again to subway systems in other cities. My friends and I would often work all day, hop onto the subway after work, jet across the country on a high speed train to Seoul, hop into their subway network, pop up right at our desired location, party all night, and then reverse the order and be back to our respective apartments back in Daegu by sunrise. It was sofa king fun and convenient. \n\nThe bike path systems in Korea were also incredible. Every river had a bike path (kinda sad cuz they\u0019d abandoned trying to keep any sort of natural feel or function to the river banks, but that\u0019s another topic). Maybe others can expand on this, I\u0019m pretty sure there are bike paths connecting the cities around the country. I didn\u0019t utilize it to its full extent, but man was it great biking along the rivers around the city. \n\nI had a native Korean girlfriend who was 25 years old. She never had a license or drove a car. When I questioned her why, she said, \u001cwhy would I ever need to drive?\u001d. Between the taxis, buses, subways, and trails, having or driving a car was completely unnecessary. \n\nFast forward some extensive traveling and utilizing public transit in cities like Beijing (circle method used here not so sick), Fukuoka, and Kuala Lumpur, I\u0019m a geek for it. \n\nI moved back to MT, aptly nick named the \u001cLast Best Place\u001d, to a town called Bozeman. If you aren\u0019t clued in yet, Bozeman, MT is BOOMING. Insane population growth and development happening here. After seeing a swath of the world, there\u0019s certainly cool things cities and communities can develop, and there\u0019s definite some shite ones. Sadly, Bozeman is adopting no cool ones. The development is going gangbusters and the city commission has almost zero initiatives for biking or public transit. There\u0019s zero flow to the city, the traffic is piling up, and the development is entirely based around cars. I\u0019m talking massive parking and road requirements, wasted space and atrocious suburban sprawl everywhere. \n\nIt\u0019s so sad to watch a city with all the resources to be a pioneer of conscious and sustainable urban development in the \u001cnew frontier\u001d miss the mark so badly. If there\u0019s any strategies or resources for this specific problem, please share. \n\nI haven\u0019t totally been idle on this issue above, as I presented a Pecha Kucha on the topic to a sold out theater a couple years back. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/5i5JorNlaF0) Let me know what you think!\n\nAlso, I recently stumbled across a larger passenger train movement for the state of MT. I\u0019m assuming you\u0019re unfamiliar, so AmTrak runs thru MT in the north part of the state, where relatively nobody lives, and does not run through the south part of the state where most all of the population resides. The idea of this movement is to implement passenger trains in the southern rail line to connect all the urban centers of Missoula, Butte, Bozeman, and Billings. The larger goal would be to connect Bozeman to SLC and Billings to Denver as they are relatively straight shots. Check out that movement here. [Big Sky Rail Authority](https://montanapassengerrailsummit.org/big-sky-passenger-rail-authority)\n\nWoof, anyways, long winded rant over. Trains rule. Light rails &gt; subways. Bike specific paths only please. Fuck cars. Conscious, efficient, development only. \n\nTLDR: my first post. Korea has awesome public transit that changed my life. Bozeman is dropping the ball and becoming a car wasteland. Watch my passion presentation. [Traffic and Parking suck](https://youtu.be/5i5JorNlaF0)",

      "text": "\nFrom the link:\n\n**EU institutions commit to boost cycling across Europe**\n\nToday [3rd of April, 2024], the EU is taking another important step in reducing transport emissions by adopting the European Declaration on Cycling. In the margins of the Informal Transport European Council, Adina V\u0003lean, Commissioner for Transport, will sign the declaration together with Karima Delli, Chair of the Transport Commitee of the European Parliament and Georges Gilkinet, Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium.\n\nThe declaration recognises cycling as a sustainable, accessible, and affordable means of transport, with strong added value for the EU economy. It includes clear commitments, such as safe and coherent cycling networks in cities, better links with public transport and secure parking spaces and access to recharging points for e-bikes. These commitments shall be taken at EU, national regional and local level. These are all necessary elements in improving the quality and quantity of cycling infrastructure across Member States and making cycling more attractive to the public.\n\nBased on a proposal launched by the European Commission in October 2023 and responding to requests from the European Parliament and Member States, the declaration constitutes a joint political commitment and a strategic compass for existing and future policies and initiatives related to cycling.\n\nCommissioner for Transport, Adina V\u0003lean, said: \"We recognise cycling's myriad benefits: it reduces pollution, eases urban congestion, and promotes healthier lifestyles. Moreover, cycling is a cornerstone of the European industry, driving innovation and growth while creating high-quality local jobs. Embracing cycling aligns with the EU's industrial strategy and its objectives.\"\n\nNow the EU parliament doesn\u0019t make the law and certainly not municipal or local regulations that are most likely to bring concrete changes. But you can use this document to argue and demand action from whoever oversees your part of the world. Get to work EU citizens!",

      "title": "Indigenous reserves/reservations",
      "text": "Hey, I'm an Ojibwe woman and I\u0019ve been feeling the need to add what many Indigenous people\u0019s experience of urban planning and public transit is in the US and Canada, because there's hardly anyone online who mentions how it has affected us and how devastating it is for future generations.\n\nI\u0019ve found that whenever Canada and the USA\u0019s history of city-building is talked about, it starts off with how European settlers made walkable areas, and then down the line, mention redlining, zoning and white flight. I think it\u0019s really important though, to add that settlers essentially zoned from the beginning of colonization on this continent \u0013 hence the existence of reserves/reservations.\\*\n\nThe source of a lot of Indigenous folks\u0019 present-day struggles is that the lands our ancestors were sequestered to had little to offer under a foreign government\u0019s version of economy. Everything suddenly needed to be about profit, and for a time, it was illegal to live traditionally, so we were screwed over from day 1.\n\nCommunities in reserves are essentially small towns/villages, but most have some major things in common with suburbia: These areas are residential, they hardly generate revenue, they aren't self-sustaining, and so they rely heavily on external financial support. In a way, suburbs are just reserves for middle-class and rich people.\n\nIn a /fuckcars perspective, reserve communities practically show the future lives of people living in sprawl: Eventually there\u0019s not enough jobs nearby to go around due to a wide area of low density. Single-family homes become multi-generational. Eventually, cars and highways just aren't fast enough to justify taking a job that's far, far away. And so the poverty really sets in. There\u0019s a point where communities absolutely need to have trains or else they\u0019re stuck in a bubble.\n\nI don't want to give off the impression that every rez is the same, because they aren't. The ones that happen to be a half-hour's drive away from cities tend to have richer residents. Car centrism though, is the norm that keeps the post-apocalyptic era going for Indigenous folks.\n\nMaking reserves thrive is tough because a lot of things have to improve alongside each other. There\u0019s inherently a problem though, when the only way to do a drive from a community to a workplace is with a car. While some reserves are too remote (ex. Attawapiskat, Ontario), there\u0019s reserves that would benefit from having a train or bus passing by that goes to the next city over. If a city is a 1 hour drive away, what a miracle it would be if it became a half-hour train ride.\n\nIgnorant people always ask, \u001cwell, why don\u0019t those Natives move?\u001d A bunch of us have though. In Canada, half of Indigenous people live off-rez (including myself), and in the US, it\u0019s about 80%. A significant number made the leap then raised their children in colonial towns and cities, and some rose out of poverty. But the cycle of poverty continues for a lot of us urban Natives \u0013 living off the rez is expensive. We\u0019re crippled by rising costs of living like everyone else is, and the fact that a car has been made to be a basic need in life doesn\u0019t help. That climb out of poverty is much longer when a car is needed.\n\nI'm preaching to the choir now, so I\u0019ll leave it at that. I hope this widens your perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I grew up in Canada, everyone tends to say \u001creserve\u001d or \u001cFirst Nation\u001d here.",

Only now at 33 there are a few things that make it harder and harder for me to maintain my carfree lifestyle: \n\n- I'll soon inherit a small cabin in the mountains, the perfect retreat for hikes but only accessible by car.\n\n- I have a newborn and the only trustworthy babysitter is my mother, who lives in the outskirts. I can get there by public transport, but it takes over an hour in one direction.

But whenever he has to go to office, he's gone all day because the commute by public transport is such a pain. His office is in a small town outside of our city. It's past my mom's place. By car it would be easy to drop off baby at my mom's, go to office, pick baby up. By public transport his office and my mom's place are world's apart.\n\nSo... my boyfriend and my family has been trying to talk me into buying a car. I understand it would make a lot of sense, but I hate the idea of owning a car. I just hate cars. But I already checked carsharing options and taxi services and they just won't fo the job. I fucking need a car! Shit!\n\nSo, if you were in my situation, what kind of car would you get? I was thinking used, maybe a Volkswagen Polo.

      "title": "On using people with disabilities as a reason to continue car dependence.",
      "text": "I have disabilities. And as someone with disabilities, I do not appreciate hearing, \"but, people with disabilities!\", which is often used by proponents of continued car dependence. I do not appreciate hearing that walkable/accessible cities are inherently \"ableist\".\n\nMy own situation is as follows: I have heat and exercise intolerance due to autonomic dysfunction. My blood pressure can drop suddenly if I overheat, causing me to faint. I also have vertebral dissections, which reduce how much blood reaches my brain. It also raises my stroke risk. The symptoms of this can be exacerbated by heat as well.\n\nDespite this, and how it means I cannot always walk or cycle places, especially with the heat waves in my area, I will **always** advocate for walkable/accessible cities.\n\nMy first beef with, \"but people with disabilities!\" is not every disability is the same. Disabilities are not homogeneous. There are varying needs. Yes, some people will **always** need to take a vehicle because of their limitations or health circumstances. Some people cannot transport themselves voluntarily, be it in a wheelchair or otherwise. Some people need to be in a climate-controlled environment because autonomic problems make it prohibitively hard to maintain their body temperature, especially in hot summer months or cold winters, as is often the case with me.\n\nHowever, is not *always* the case for me. It's not the case with many other people, either.\n\nFurthermore, it is disingenuous to claim that having a disability = needing to drive or use a car. Many people with disabilities cannot drive, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot walk, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot ride a bicycle, but can ride an ebike. Many people cannot walk, but can drive a scooter. Many people have ups and downs with their disabilities where they can sometimes function better or worse, so their abilities **fluctuate.**\n\nThis is not a one-size-fits-all situation. There is more nuance than that. The idea that car dependence is somehow a blanket solution is mired in a simplified, naïve presumption of what disability is, and isn't, and it's putting words in the mouths of everyone who has a disability.\n\nWe need to talk about the **economic burden** of personal vehicle ownership as well. Vehicle ownership is often touted as some kind of gold standard for PWD accommodation, but the reality is, many people with disabilities require DME (durable medical equipment). These devices include, among others: small daily living aids, ambulatory aids like canes and crutches, bathroom aids, special beds and bedding, scooters, wheelchairs, ventilators, oxygen therapy, lifts, hearing aids, etc. These can be very costly. I have a piece of DME that recently cost me $1,400 to purchase. Some people need costly medication too.\n\nThis creates a financial burden, which only worsens if someone cannot work because of their disabilities, or if they otherwise need to work less than is economically viable. Disability assistance does exist, but it doesn't even come **close** to covering the cost of housing, unless you're crammed into a place with multiple roommates. This is effectively hidden homelessness.\n\nIn Vancouver, a generally walkable city, the baseline PWD payment for a single person is under $1,500. The average rent for an unfurnished, one-bedroom apartment is over [$2,300.](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/vancouver-rent-prices-july-2023-7262184)\n\nAnd forget covering all the other costs.\n\nIf you can't do that, you are forced into the suburbs.\n\nBut unfortunately, despite the decrease in housing costs in the suburbs, owning a personal vehicle generally still means you're paying a **ton.** Vehicles take a massive chunk out of someone's earnings, often hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, according to Stefan Gossling's oft-cited [study.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003943) Personal vehicles make it even harder for someone with a disability to get ahead, forcing them to merely subsist.\n\nCompulsory personal vehicle ownership, as a result of car dependence, is often accompanied by sprawl as well. This creates an overabundance of suburban areas and roads that may not even have sidewalks. Due to potentially reduced income, people with disabilities often need to live in suburban areas, as opposed to city centers, which often have higher housing costs. If someone with a disability lives in a suburban area, and they cannot get around without a car, they need to remain at home unless they have someone to drive them around. This chauffeuring needs to fit both peoples' schedules. For many people, this vastly reduced opportunity for casual and spontaneous interaction can be very isolating, and lead to mental health deficits.\n\nEven if someone is capable of getting around by themselves, whether because they are ambulatory or have a wheelchair or other mobility device, it may not be feasible for them to venture from home. For example, if someone is visually impaired and cannot drive, but can still get around by walking, they still may not be able to leave their suburbs unless they walk a **very long** distance, for a long time - and unless they are willing to compromise their safety. Many newly-developed suburbs do not even have sidewalks. This makes independent living prohibitive for many people.\n\nCar-dependence proponents will often claim if someone has a disability and cannot drive, they can just get someone to drive them places. This is not possible in many cases. Not everyone has relatives or friends on standby to drive them places. Some people have not been able to make social connections because of their disability. Some people may have a connection or two, but the connection is too far away (which is often due to sprawl, and how isolated different neighborhoods can be) to provide reliable service. The very idea is rooted in ableism and naïve thinking.\n\nBut let's imagine a scenario where someone, in spite of the lack of sidewalks in their neighborhood, decides to go to a store. Because of car dependence, they will be exposed to noise pollution, which is known to inappropriately arouse and harm the sympathetic nervous system, as documented [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) and [here.](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8f98-tph-How-Loud-is-Too-Loud-Health-Impacts-Environmental-Noise.pdf) This is especially stressful for people with sensory issues, such as autism and even PTSD. They will be exposed to road pollution, which also negatively impacts health, as documented [here,](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/sc-hc/H144-91-2022-eng.pdf) [here,](https://archive.li/xIyBP) and [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855107/) Due to hostile road designs resulting from car dependence, they will also be [especially vulnerable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) to traffic violence.\n\n**And here's a stark reality:** car violence causes an untold number of disabilities in previously able-bodied people. Many people become disabled because vehicles strike them while driving way too fast to be safe, when in reality, those vehicles should be going very, very slowly anywhere that pedestrians and vehicles mix. But this is conveniently ignored by proponents of car dependence. In addition, many able-bodied people will experience an injury or disability at some point in their lives, for some reason or another, and it may prevent them from driving.\n\nI know multiple people who have sprained ankles and needed crutches. What happens if their right foot is seriously injured?\n\nMore pressingly, why are these scenarios always *totally overlooked* by proponents of car dependence? (Don't answer that. It was [rhetorical.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias))\n\nReducing dependence on personal vehicles means roads will require less frequent maintenance. This means more funds will be available for sidewalks, so more areas can actually get sidewalks in the first place, and the existing sidewalks can be widened/improved so people in wheelchairs, on crutches, and so on don't need to play hopscotch on broken (or incomplete) concrete to get around. Or, people can use personal mobility lanes if they don't want to go *bump-bump-bump* over sidewalk cracks. Not only will sidewalks and mobility lanes have more funding, but it will allow a city to spend more money on accessibility amenities, including benches, shady structures, large trees, cooling stations, water fountains, and public washrooms, which everyone in a community can use.\n\nLess roads also means there will be less asphalt to absorb heat. This can lower the overall ambient temperature, reducing the effect of [heat islands.](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/articles/pavement_thermal.cfm) There are a few videos out there of people cooking eggs on sidewalks - asphalt retains [even more heat](https://www.forconstructionpros.com/concrete/article/22210872/igga-international-grooving-grinding-association-study-on-concrete-pavement-factor-in-urban-heat-island-uhi-effect) due to the darker material. Vegetation, and the shade created by it, also helps reduce ambient temperature.\n\nWhen streets are designed for people first, and safety first, it will also reduce the chances of vehicle-related accidents. The overall noise levels will become quieter, both ambient tire noise and honking, making it more pleasant for people with sensory issues to move around outside. Noise-cancelling headphones may not be as necessary. Visually impaired people would not be subjected to victim-blaming tips like \"watch for turning drivers\", when they often literally *cannot* watch for them, as there would be more emphasis on driver caution, and better prophylactic street safety features, instead of pedestrian caution.\n\nThe logistics of driving for people with disabilities will **also** improve. In a less car-dependent place, someone with a disability will not need to compete with able-bodied people over parking, and thus, they (or the person driving them) won't need to stress out about it. Parking will be easier to find. Since there will be less drivers on the road, there will be a lower chance of someone parking in the disabled parking spot at businesses when they shouldn't have.\n\nIt's just **less stressful.** There will be less hypotheticals, and less contingency planning that needs to be done in the realm of transporting oneself. To me, this feels liberating. Due to my disabilities, I always need to think three steps ahead to plan for unexpected things. Car dependence adds another layer of \"what if\" to that. Finding a parking spot, timed parking limits, payment, accidents on the way (I have been rear-ended in standstill traffic before), etc.\n\nThis isn't the only thing car dependence adds in a negative way.\n\nAs someone with disabilities, I feel that my life and daily activities are restricted by default, simply by merit of my disability existing. Proponents of car dependence are not allies. And they are not doing people with disabilities any favours by insisting that car dependence, aka the continued neglect of our **personal choice** on how to transport ourselves around, is the way forward. That just adds additional restrictions. It removes an element of agency that doesn't need to be absent in the first place. That isn't right.\n\nThere needs to be a choice at minimum. Right now, there isn't a choice in far, far too many places.\n\n**All of that said:**\n\nI do have concerns and fears about accessible city implementation, as do others. These concerns are not unfounded. New infrastructure can completely miss the mark on ADA/ADA compliance. Buses can lack air conditioning (this is a **major** issue for me in Vancouver). Many older buildings are walkups and do not have lifts, making them inaccessible to people who use mobility devices. Some public transport centers do not have elevators within reasonable distance to stairs, forcing people with mobility devices to detour extensively, soaking up time. Many bus stops lack both shelter/shade and benches, so I need to sit on the ground. And I am constantly bothered by how few public washrooms there are for people with gastrointestinal issues. It is degrading to need to enter a random Starbucks and silently head to the washroom, because the duty of providing such a basic amenity has been shunted off to nearby businesses (usually because a municipality refuses to fund the regular maintenance of facilities like this).\n\n**However,** these implementation problems do not make the notion of an accessible/walkable city inherently ableist in itself. The problem is with the **implementation** and the allocation of resources toward fixing the flaws, not the concept. It is manipulative to insist the opposite is true, and therefore that accessible/walkable cities should not exist.\n\nI will not say, \"but the buses are unbearably hot, therefore, I hate accessible/walkable cities\".\n\nI will say, \"fix the fucking buses, I have places to go without a car\".",

The short of it is that if you want cities to be more sustainable/better, get rid of the codified ways they've been forced to be that way - parking mandates, density restrictions, designing for cars only.\n\nThese types of regulations are what give us the uninspiring, car-centric and fundamentally unsustainable cities prevalent across North America.

      "title": "IMO, cars and Transit/Bicycle/Pedestrian infrastructure are mutually exclusive. If we want better transit and pedestrian infrastructure, we'll inevitably have to make driving less convenient/viable.",
      "text": "One aspect that is not talked about is that while we can improve transit and bicycle infrastructure all we want if we don't curve back and disincentivize car use, those efforts will be in vain because surprise surprise, many carbrained folks would never \"choose\" to take transit on their own accords and have to be compelled to use alternative modes of transportation. The thing is that, even if we build transit infrastructure, if there is still some appeal to driving, people will still choose to drive. That's why I believe that cars and transit are mutually exclusive. Coexistence isn't possible, either choose one or the other.\n\nFor example, why does transit suck in your area and the buses are always late? It's because of cars blocking the path! Why is cycling dangerous? It's because of cars! Why don't kids play outside? It's because of cars! Why is your area dead and soulless, seemingly devoid of life? It's because of cars!\n\nImprovements to transit infrastructure, and making a place more livable in general, come at the expense of \"convenience\" for cars. Want to make the buses run faster and on time? Give them a dedicated lane which means one less lane for cars. Want to make cycling safer? Give them their own pathway which can take away a lane from cars. Want to have kids play outside without the risk of getting mowed down, give them car-free areas.\n\nBut, without proper counter-measures, cars will always find a way in invade transit and bike only places. How many times of you seen a car blocking a bike lane? How many times of you seen cars with a single occupant using the HOV or bus only lane? Drivers are the most arrogant folks out there who are more than willing to break the rules (such as driving in the bus only lane). That is why we need proper enforcement on stuff like bike and bus only lanes to keep the automotive invaders out! \n\nTo improve transit and make our urban landscape more livable, we need a carrot-and-stick approach in regards to disincentivizing car use. The carrot can be very cheap if not free transit, high-freqency metro trains, safe bike lanes, etc. While the stick can be congesting pricing, less lanes for cars, high parking rates, or just outright ban cars from driving within a city, because screw the feelings of carbrain folks!\n\nImproving transit isn't just for personal preference and convenience, it's necessary if we want to mitigate harm done to the environment, as cars, both their direct and indirect effects, are one of the greatest threats to the natural environment.\n\nIn my opinion, coexistence between cars and transit isn't possible, as cars always find a way to sabotage transit. Car-centric design not only socially alienates people and makes ours lives miserable, cars are a direct threat to people, the environment, and the planet as a whole. If we want to have a habitable planet in the future, we must abandon the wasteful, harmful, and inefficient car-centric design in favor of transit oriented design which are almost always more efficient, sustainable, and better for our lives and natural world.",

      "text": "I'm a first-time poster here, though I've been lurking for some time, inspired by NJB and Climate Town. I'm a university professor at a rural (= conservative, low income area) university in the US, teaching an earth science course mainly taken by aspiring education majors who'll become elementary and middle school teachers. Many of them are female and of non-traditional age (late 20s/30s).\n\nFor my climate change module, I'm looking for videos or articles that clearly illuminate how the car dependent lifestyle that all of them lead is ruining the planet.\n\nAs you can safely imagine, most of my students have grown up shopping in big-box stores only know of car-dependent lifestyles. They have probably never traveled abroad, or even traveled much outside of their home state. And, as in so many places in the US like this, public transit is practically non-existent, as are bike lanes (Even I always drive because biking is too terrifying). The towns in the region only have sidewalks in the downtown core. Many students live in the country 20 or 50 km from town, on large plots of land (or some non-walkable subdivision). Driving 100 km in a day (or more!) running errands/commuting is completely normal. Each family member above 16 has a car. It is reasonable to assume that more than one of my students has a spouse or family member with a big truck, which they claim they need to haul crap or all their destructive toys around (dirt bikes, RVs etc.), get to work in the snow, or all the other carbrain excuses we know.\n\nAs part of the course, I have a discussion assignment on sustainability and energy use and what they can do to use less. Many students find it challenging to approach the topic, and you can tell they have many misconceptions. A lot of them are oblivious on how wasteful their single-family home lifestyle is and instead talk the industry mantra that a little recycling or switching off some lights is enough of a good deed. They may mention that the husband drives that big truck that uses so much gas, but he \u001cneeds\u001d it to get to work (and pay down the massive car loan which they can barely afford). They think that living out in the country makes them environmentally friendlier because of the big green lawn (that they mow with a riding gas mower every week).  Land is cheap so even poorer people live out in the middle of nowhere on a trailer on some tract of land.\n\nI'm looking for materials that can gently introduce (at least the more open-minded students) to the idea that this kind of lifestyle has significant environmental impacts and open their eyes to consider walkable communities for those students who may be relocating after graduation, advocate for better zoning and public transit, and challenge the notion that a big house with a big yard are the only \"proper\" way to raise a family, and perhaps plant that seed in some of the students who will also become future teachers.  Any recommendations on videos and articles would be appreciated. I am aware of the YouTube urbanist channels (NJB, CityNerd, Strong towns etc.) but I they might be too snarky/off-putting to that audience. So I would think it would be preferable to share with them something produced by a larger news organization/TV channel to make it look more official/impartial and avoid just talking about the Netherlands. Does such exist? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "**I\u0019m a product designer, and over the last year I've been working towards solving this issue: the inconvenience of doing grocery shopping without a car.**\n\n[This is the Milmo 1813](https://lemilmo.com).\n\nI come from a city that's been increasingly designing for car-independence and sustainability through plastic bag bans, and infrastucture re-design. The thing is, with all these changes, there still isn't a great solution for doing groceries without a car.\n\nI designed a this bag so that one can use it as their work bag, but also use it to comfortably pick up groceries on their way home via metro/subway/bus.\n\n**It was important to me to design a bag with an office-capable style that doesn't compromise on functionality. It does this through mainly one feature: a removable, washable, waterproof compartment liner.**\n\n[Groceries, and spillables go in the removable liner of the left, which connects to the inside of the outer \\(right\\) via snap buttons.](https://preview.redd.it/gc155j4ohz0c1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f35d3c8dc5e1636a0cc96507d2b3cbc51efd93b)\n\n**I love Montreal\u0019s metro system, but grocery shopping on it sucks.**\n\nI live in Montreal, home to one of the best cities in the world for urbanism and car-free living due to our medium-density development, a native 15-minute city design, high number of parks, and our robust and reliable Metro (We call the subway the metro here).\n\nThere is one thing though about commuting via public transport.\n\n**Doing grocery shopping on foot or by public transport sucks.**\n\n**My city banned the distribution of single-use shopping bags, forcing us to use annoying, cheap, ugly reusable grocery bags.**\n\n[The city of Montreal completely banned the sale and distribution of all plastic bags in fall 2022.](https://montreal.ca/en/articles/plastic-bags-what-you-need-to-know-about-legislation-20575) This means that everyone must now carry around a reusable grocery bag with them in their commutes, should they stumble upon the need for a grocery run. If not, they would have to buy one at the store which could cost anywhere from $0.50 cents cad to $2.00 cad.\n\nMade of cheap fabric, they\u0019re ugly, flimsy, and not very comfortable when walking/commuting over long distances to use since they can only be used handheld. Because of this, I don\u0019t always bring them around with me for example to work. Next thing you know I had a cupboard full of these ugly things.\n\nAnd then one day during a grocery run after work, refusing to buy another ugly bag, I decided to place my items in my work bag which had my laptop in it. The feeling of lettuce smushing up against the same fabric that housed my laptop disgusted me.\n\n**That\u0019s when I got the idea to design a bag with a removable, waterproof, washable liner so that I could pick up groceries on my Metro commute home from work.** **I decided to tackle this as a design challenge.**\n\n**Why the bags currently on the market, groceries, and public transportation don\u0019t mix well:**\n\n* Backpacks and work bags are too hard to clean if something spills or flakes, making them unsuitable for picking up groceries on the way home from work.\n* Tote bags are too small for picking up a load of groceries, and don\u0019t provide enough of a structure to safely carry items without the weight of items crushing each other.\n* Reusable grocery bags are frankly ugly and are of poor quality, can\u0019t be carried over the shoulder, and often suffer from the same issues as tote bags.\n\n**My solution in the form of bag design:**\n\n* I designed a lightweight, reinforced base so that the items wouldn\u0019t shuffle and crush themselves.\n* I designed a liner compartment that could be easily washed and removed after a spill. It connects via button snaps. Everything else would go into a laptop pocket on the inside so I could keep things organized.\n* The bag needed to be stylish enough so I could take it to work confidently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jc12f22ekz0c1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f7be0df9529b468d42ee96a00f7daa90f7af16\n\n**I re-engineered the tote bag handle design so that the handles were stronger.**\n\nMost importantly, the bag needed to have insanely strong handles. I\u0019ve repaired a few friends\u0019 bags over the years, with all of them ripping at where the handles met the body of the bag.In most handle designs, the weight of the contents are usually distributed at just two small squares.\n\nSo if I were to design a quality work bag that could take heavy loads, I would have to design a strap system with a larger load-surface than the regular tote bag.\n\nI had each handle connect along the entire length of the bottom of the bag, creating a cradle system, and had it run through these tubes that guide the straps down to the bottom of the bag. This creates an extremely strong handle, and gives it a unique look.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apit6a9gjz0c1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=510f68d05c70606d9de570cabbb1b69f2b059bd2\n\n**A year of prototyping in my apartment bedroom and through whatsapp**\n\nAfter a year of prototyping in my apartment and sending plans to manufacturers, I\u0019ve finally launched this bag that will hopefully help us all do our groceries sustainably, comfortably, stylishly.\n\nI call it the \u001cMilmo 1813\u001d (it\u0019s 18 inches by 13 inches)\n\n[Here\u0019s a link to check it out](https://lemilmo.com)!\n\nI'm offering up a piece of my story in the hope that it resonates with others on similar paths. This product is an example of how product design can provide practical, and quality solutions that support a vision of a more accessible, car-independent future. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions! I'm always open to criticsm and discussing design solutions for urbanism and car-independence.\n\n**TLDR: I got tired of carrying around and buying low-quality, uncomfortable grocery bags for doing grocery runs after work, so I designed a work bag that allows me to safely carry my work items, as well as grocery items comfortably over the shoulder. It does this with a removable, washable, waterproof liner that separates my work items from groceries.**",

      "title": "Literally... Trains!",
      "text": "So, given the climate and ecological crisis that we're facing, and how our governments aren't doing jack sh\\*t to combat it. I thought I would share with you some positive insights about how we already *have* the technology to mitigate some of the worse effects of the climate crisis. And how we don't need some fancy \"Tech Bro\" miracle gadgetbahn technology, but rather, use an existing and proven technology that we already have by just implementing it correctly.\n\nAnd the solution is Quite Literally... Trains!\n\nLets start with fuel/power:\n\nMost greenhouse gas emissions, at least in the transportation sector are from cars, planes, and ships, with trains accounting for less than 5%. This is due to many trains being electric power, gaining their energy from the grid via overhead wires, third rail, and hopefully in the future, contactless power transmission.\n\nThere's no need for large batteries that can catch fire, whose manufacturing is terrible for the environment, not to mention the [child-labor](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara) and exploitations.\n\nBy gaining their energy *externally* through the power grid and not needing to carry their own power, so long as the power plants are green, trains are and will continue to be one of the most cleanest and energy efficient mode of transportation.\n\nEven if the trains are powered by diesel, due to the inherit efficiency of trains, the effect is negligible (though they should all be electric).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tld0d4bx8ksd1.jpg?width=3579&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d94a5e0ae45e49181a772e81eaf156ec597c24d\n\n[https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/environment-and-safety/sydney-trains-environment-and-sustainability/why-rail-travel-a](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/environment-and-safety/sydney-trains-environment-and-sustainability/why-rail-travel-a)\n\n[https://www.greenguides.net/post/trains-reduce-carbon-footprint](https://www.greenguides.net/post/trains-reduce-carbon-footprint)\n\nNext, lets go over Physical Space:\n\nEven with trains that have a larger loading gauge of over 3 meters, at most for a double track, including the equipment on the side, a double track is usually under 10 meters wide. That may seem big, but a single highway lane in North American is 3.66 meters (12 feet) wide, not the mention the shoulder, how vegetation near the highway has to be cut so that a car doesn't directly crash into a tree, and don't get my started on a 20 lane highway.\n\nAnd let's not forget, PARKING!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxs9a0k49ksd1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e040c43852c8565275ae827f662aa79555e790a0\n\nSo much space is wasted for parking cars, especially on surface parking lots. Thousands of Arces of land, land that belongs to plants, animals, and people are paved over for a parking lot! F\\*ck surface parking lots especially!\n\nWhereas with trains, a track siding is more than sufficient as the trains can just park in a line parallel to the mainline. And even the largest of train yards do not take up the sheer about of space used for parking cars.\n\nContinuing on with Ecological Impacts:\n\nWhile all human development *does* unfortunately negatively impact the environment, trains can mitigate our impact. Going over the points made before, trains produce little to no air emissions, take up less space, and generally do not impact the environment as badly as cars. And especially with grade separated underground and/or elevated railways, A. They don't cut the environment in half, and B. Once construction is done, nature can reclaim the area, I mean, just look at how trees and vegetation grows around a railway viaduct.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dt1rrp1q9ksd1.jpg?width=1414&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf35509aa48c88beeed47d259589432a80cc688\n\nHuman and Animal Collisions:\n\nIt's no secret that cars kill millions of animals each year and thousands of people! Like holy sh\\*t, F\\*ck Cars!\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nAnd while trains *do* unfortunately hit people and animals, it's nowhere near the same extent as cars for several reasons.\n\nA. Even on a frequent mainline with trains every ten minutes or so, it's nowhere near the constant traffic of a highway, meaning that animals and people can have a chance to cross safely.\n\nB. Trains are more predictable than cars and don't invade so many spaces unlike cars which can crash into you even if you're not crossing the road.\n\nC. Railway lines are more likely to be elevated, greatly reducing the risk of train-people/animal collisions compared to roads which are almost always on the surface.\n\nIf most high-speed and high frequency railway lines are elevated, not only are they grade separated making frequent service and automation easier, but they would have little impact on people and animals once construction is complete as people and animals can just walk underneath without worrying about getting run over, the same can't be said about cars.\n\nResources:\n\nTrains last a long time, like a *really* long time. Many old steam trains are still operational, and more older metro trains from the 1970s and 80s are still in operations. Compared to cars and your iPhone, trains don't need to be visually updated each year, which lets be real here is a massive waste of resources. Unlike personal commodities, trains are made on a per-order basis meaning they're not mass produce, reducing the chance of unsold units.\n\nOnce a timeless, future proof design is met (open gangway metro trains) even trains from a new batch with updated technology can quite literally look [exactly the same](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/canada-line-skytrain-new-trains-in-service) as the older first batch. Also, trains are more likely to be modular and can be upgraded and rebuilt, and generally use less resources than cars. Also, you don't need as many of them to maintain good service.\n\nAnd on the infrastructure side of things, old, wore out steel railway tracks can be recycled into new rails, and due to the better weight distribution of trains, concrete railway viaduct can basically last forever with proper maintenance whereas car destroy their own roads, and there's no need to \"repave\" the way for railways to the same extent as with cars.\n\nCountering suburban sprawl:\n\nCars encourage suburban sprawl, which is devastating towards the environment. One thing that's common in many nature documentaries are scenes of \"human encroachment into nature\" as they show an image of a forest being cut down for houses. The issue here is suburban sprawl, not people as a whole. (Also, it's the rich who produce more waste than anyone else. Blame them, and not humans as a whole).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vr7owdkaksd1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe968f938abff43f931754639ce328d0eea41e2d\n\nContrary to popular belief, having dense cities is actually *better* for the environment than suburban sprawl as no matter what, human development disturbs the natural world. But what we can do is minimize the impact by minimizing the space we use. Having dense cities allows for less space to be taken up by people, and *more* space to left for nature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pk41kgfsaksd1.jpg?width=2856&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dab5829e7863e35d2f527ceb3f5d5473d76f462\n\nAlong with elevated railways that have little impact on nature once completed, trains can reduce suburban sprawl and hence, allow more space for nature.\n\nTrains are a stepping stone in mitigating modern-day, militaristic imperialism (this section is really long and I do go into a rant. Sorry in advance):\n\nThis is a more political point, but think about, how much of modern day imperialism can be tied directly or indirectly to cars? A lot of it in my books. The meme that the United States invades a place with oil is very much true. What was the Iraq War for, oil (not because Saddam has WMDs that never existed or about fighting for \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" nah, it was for oil). What is the Russian invasion of Ukraine for, well it's technically for natural gas, but we might as well say it's for oil.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/niglnu1kbksd1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c048eb886b4e3e39f53fb3a2e1d5162d3dda727\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3ts0tygbksd1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e13b8fa780b16b825b05a4cf89f4920164baf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jvk7efhbksd1.jpg?width=3500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5c3ccc75b592e33dc87730faec9df304e6f46c\n\nAnd why does the U.S. support Israel despite its constant war crimes and that their \"soldiers\" are loudly and proudly posting their war crimes on social media, its for oil, as Isntreal is nothing more than a US military outpost in the Middle East to control its oil. As Joe Biden said back in the 1980s, \"If there wasn't an Israel, we would make an Israel!\"\n\nAlso, my mom's country (Cambodia) was destabilized by US intervention (Operation Menu) which allowed Pol Pot to take over due to the destabilization caused by the bombings. And the US would later support Pol Pot as a way to get back at the Vietnamese. So I have little tolerance for US military supporters and War Hawks in general. Those people can F\\*ck off. Also, the French colonized Indochina for its rubber for car tires. So, F\\*ck the French as well.\n\nRant Over:\n\nSorry for the rant, but to simplify, because the US is so car dependent, and that expensive gas would be devastating towards the US economy. Market forces compells the US to seize cheap oil by any means necessary, hence the lame excuse that \"We're here to spread 'Freedom' and 'Democracy'\" when it's really just for the oil, I mean the US supports the theocratic government of Saudi Arabia for crying out loud.\n\nAnd it's just not only gas cars, many battery-electric cars have the cobalt and lithium for their batteries being mined by literal slave labor! So, even if gas cars are phased out for electric ones, human and ecological exploitation is at the core of the auto industry.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, trains a*re* unfortunately used in imperalism and wars, namely for supplies and resource extraction. But I think I can safely say that while trains were used for imperialist ventures, said imperialist ventures are not *for* trains as trains can be made domestically with relatively little resources, whereas cars, especially electric cars require more rare earth minerals. It was not like the British were here to say \"A yes, we are here to 'civilize' these 'savages' in the name of trains!\" No, they brought trains over for resource extraction, but it wasn't *for* trains.\n\nOf course, the issue here is capitalism, but I won't go too deeply into that for this post. But I can argue that most modern wars for oil are either directly or indirectly cause by cars.\n\nNow, let's compared the crappy imperialist legacy of the auto industry to trains. For the most part, trains can be produce domestically with relatively few resources. Are more likely to be manufactured by a state-owned company which \"usually\" tends to have better labor relations. Are built by skilled personnel, and are make on a per-order basis and *not* mass produced, reducing waste. I forget to mention this part before but to put it simply, trains (the rolling stock themselves) are just not as profitable as cars. But that's not a bad thing as the utility of trains far exceeds that of cars.\n\nNow, in more transit oriented countries, there just isn't the imperialist need for oil to power cars since there's less cars and less reliance on oil. Take Japan for example, gas is expensive, but since the country is less dependent on cars, it can make due without offensive military actions. I know that in Modern day Japan, it has a self defense force which is prohibited from taking part in offensive actions (though that has to do with WW2. Don't get me wrong, Imperial Japan is hella Imperialist which committed countless atrocities, yet their military lacked the oil to continue the long term fight). Needless to say, when a country is less dependent on cars and oil, it's less likely to take part in overt imperialist actions.\n\nThere's still soft power imperialism which is a totally different issue, not to mention that oil is mostly used for energy production, but if countries were less oil and car dependent, it is one step in mitigating modern-day, war-based imperialism (the issue is capitalism, but we need first steps here).\n\nTo conclude this section, and Spicy take here, but I'm gonna say that if you drive a car, *you* support imperialism. I mean, one of the posters on this subreddit literally says \"Stop Putin, Ride a Bike.\"\n\nNow because my previous section was so long, I'll speed run through these points.\n\nNoise Pollution:\n\nCities aren't loud, cars are! And one jerk in a loud car is *way* worse than any train. Also, modern trains are quiet.\n\nLight Pollution:\n\n[Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1fnrw3l/cars_and_light_pollution/)\n\nIn conclusion, at least with my interpretation, much of the problems that we face today can be tied directly and/or indirectly to cars. Climate change? Cars! Ecological Destruction? Cars! Suburban Sprawl? Cars! Child Slave Labor for Lithium? Cars! Imperialist Wars? Cars! Light and Noise Pollution? Cars!\n\nI know my observations may not be fully accurate and that I might be blaming cars on issues that are far more complex, but you can't deny how many issues in the world are caused by cars.\n\nBut one of the solutions to resolving and/or mitigating these issues are trains. So to save the world, we Quite Literally Need... Trains!",

      "text": "https://thewaroncars.org/2024/05/07/125-when-driving-is-not-an-option-with-anna-zivarts/\n\n&gt;The United States has built a transportation system centered around automobiles. But one-third of the nation\u0019s population can\u0019t drive, whether because of disability, age, financial hardship, immigration status, or any of a host of other factors. Those tens of millions of people are often invisible to planners and elected officials, and that\u0019s why Anna Letitia Zivarts, herself a low-vision nondriver and a longtime activist for better transportation choices, has written a new book titled When Driving Is Not an Option: Steering Away from Car Dependency (Island Press). We talked with Anna about how, by designing our transportation future for those who can\u0019t or don\u0019t feel comfortable driving, we could build a system that works better for everyone and that would be more equitable, safer, and more environmentally sustainable.\n\nTIL \"Kinetic elite\"\n\n\n[Problematizing Mobility: A Metaphor of Stickiness, Non-Places and the Kinetic Elite - Jana Costas, 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840613495324)\n\n&gt; A \u0018mobilities turn\u0019 has taken place in the social sciences, which is finding its way into organization studies. As research highlights how work and organization are mobile and spatially dispersed, metaphors of liquidity, flows, fluidity and nomads have become significant. This article seeks to contribute to the mobilities turn by introducing the Sartrean metaphor of stickiness. In contrast to the currently dominant movement metaphors, this metaphor brings into focus ambiguities and frictions and overcomes problematic connotations of nomadism and sedentarism. The paper draws on the metaphor of stickiness to reveal the kinetic elite\u0019s \u0013 the group of highly mobile elite workers \u0013 experiences of \u0018non-places\u0019 (Augé, 1995), which are ephemeral, interchangeable and monotonous spaces of mobility. Qualitative data gathered at two management consultancy firms show how the stickiness of being on the move can give rise to experiences of ambiguity, disorientation and loss: the lures of glamour, escape and liberation from places can collide with non-places that involve fixed instability, feeling stuck and that stick to one even when returning to places. In so doing, the article develops how the metaphor of stickiness can constitute an important lens for understanding and conceptualizing mobilities.\n\nPDF link, this may work directly: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=0da0b51766fd07eafbb3efd99050ebec6abc6fb4 \n\n&gt;&gt;Most importantly for this article, studies have pointed out how mobilities give rise to vagabonds\n\u0013 the modern poor, immigrant, illegal wanderer or temporary worker, on the one hand, and the\nkinetic elite \u0013 the global professional, manager, politician and academic, on the other hand (Bauman,\n1998; Cresswell, 2006). Garsten\u0019s (1999, 2008) studies of temporary workers are particularly reveal-\ning of the vagabonds\u0019 mobility. She notes how they find themselves under a mobility imperative: a\n\u0018forced mobility and uprooting, a relative lack of security and an uncertain future career\u0019 (2008, p.\n65). This results in various struggles, for instance, in terms of keeping up a sense of self and finding\na place in a community. In contrast to the vagabond, the kinetic elite worker, who, some argue,\nforms a new global elite or class (Carroll, 2008; Robinson, 2004), travels freely for pleasure and through choice, enjoys the vagabond\u0019s services and requires the immobilities of others, e.g. the\nsecretary, ground staff. Here, mobility provides the basis to construct an identity of exclusivity,\nsuperiority and wealth as well as of being fast, flexible and unconstrained (Elliott &amp; Urry, 2010;\nFelstead et al., 2005; see also McKenna &amp; Richardson, 2007). Yet, as the empirical analysis will\nshow, not even for the kinetic elite is mobility frictionless \u0013 this importantly underlines the need for\ndeveloping mobility metaphors that capture it as an ambiguous and contradictory phenomenon.",

      "text": "My Midwestern American city of about 80,000 (200,000 metro) had awesome trolleys from the 1880s to the 1940s. I know this is nothing unique or special, but I think about this every time I ride my bike to work (a bike shop) downtown and have to fight for my life on streets that used to be accessible by trolley. We were able to sustain a expansive trolley system when our population was only about 20,000. \n\nWhenever there is road construction downtown, they often end up uncovering old trolley tracks, reminding us all of what once was, which I find ironic. They are tearing up terrible five year-old roads built for cars and end up finding the reliable, old trolley tracks that once served thousands in great condition. I really really hope they bring them back one day.",

      "text": "The morning count was 17, which is about as low as that side will ever get, I'm afraid. It's been lower, but not since the lane was much newer and fewer people were accustomed to parking in it. The traffic barrels were out in force again; there must have been 100 of them in the 1.2mile stretch. \n\nI often wonder how big a gap between obstacles I really need to be able to squeeze through, and today I kind of found out: there were two barrels very close together, and I tried to ride between them, and managed to hit both of them with my handlebars. So, the smallest gap I can really use is bigger than that. Good to know. Also good to know that a handlebar collision with a barrel doesn't actually do anything to me. \n\nThe evening count was 65, also very close to the lowest numbers I've seen since the early days. (It got as low as 60 only last week, but sustained counts of under 60 have not been seen since January, right after the lane opened.)\n\nOn that evening commute, a few miles before the 1.2mile stretch in question, I encountered a familiar sight: a cop car, parked in the bike lane. A very short distance behind it, a civilian car, also illegally parked in the bike lane. Way to set the example, NYPD. \n\nLater in the ride, I observed an NYPD van abusing its siren so it could run a red light. This helped it gain a little speed, but very soon after car traffic did what car traffic always does, and, still-wailing siren notwithstanding, the van couldn't move an inch. A bunch of pedestrians jaywalked right in front of it with impunity, because if the only people empowered to enforce the law can't even stop actively breaking it, why should anyone else obey it? Also, it's not like the cops in the van could do anything about it; they were stuck, and no amount of fake siren usage could help them.\n\nBut maybe the siren usage was not fake? Maybe there was a genuine emergency somewhere ahead? Nah. There was another cop car at the very next intersection, parked (illegally, of course, but in a bus lane, not a bike lane, a refreshing change of specific method of citizen abuse), its two cops doing absolutely nothing.",

      "text": "Cars are probably one of the dumbest and most wasteful ways you could try to move billions of people around from A to B every day. The average weight of a car is 1300kg, the average weight of a person is  62kg, which means when a person drives to work, over 95% of the energy, resources, space consumed and pollution goes into moving the car itself. Then when you're at work, the car just sits there most the day, taking up space and resources, not being utilised. It's so wasteful, individual transport is just plain stupid. Cars spew out pollution, changing the climate and filling our air with toxic fumes. We breath in micro-particles contained in the exhaust of cars, particles so small they pass through cell membranes and fuck with us, give us cancer and all sorts of diseases. The toxic fumes of cars stink, the engines are noisy, even the wheels are noisy. Endless piles of tyres build up, because cars are designed to need disposable products like wheels.\n\nCars are what you get when the free market is left to decide how we live, there is no plan with cars, it's just millions of individual consumers and companies all deciding to do what is individually good for them, with no greater plan, no coordination, just the wasteful and ignorant direction of the free market producing the cluster fuck on civilisation that is cars and the roads they require. With cars you are forever remaking billions of individual vehicles as each one lives a mere generation, all the while you're constantly remaking endless stretches of roads which eventually crack and wear under the weight of all those cars and trucks. It's madness on a monumental scale, a scale so vast that it changes the landscape and climate of the entire planet.\n\nSo what could we do differently? Almost anything would be better.  Personally I'm an electrified train and tram guy, I think bikes can fill in the gaps, especially electric bikes. I think that if we took a tiny fraction of what we spend on cars collectively as individuals and governments, then applied this tiny fraction to electrified trains, trams, cycling infrastructure and subsidies on bikes and ebikes, we wouldn't want cars. For those situations where the collective system doesn't work, we could always have a few electrified cabs, but those situations are rare in a transportation system organised correctly. The collective benefits from the efficiency, the fresh air, the quiet, the enormous cost savings and sustainability would all make up for any loses to select individuals. Then there are the car enthusiasts, but they're dumb enough that they'd forget about cars quickly enough, besides, they could always just get fucked and find a hobby that doesn't destroy the planet.\n\nI'm also a big believer in relocalisation, alternative systems of planning that don't rely on the free market to decide where people live, systems that have intelligent planning and would produce communities where people live near where they work and can just ride a bike, walk or catch a tram. We often forget that a big part of the problem is that people often live hours from where they work, this is insanely inefficient for billions to be travelling so far every day, simply because the system responsible for organising where individuals live has no intelligence behind it at all and doesn't optimise anything for anyone.\n\nIf I could live in a world without cars I would, but for now as this is just a dream, I'll take solace in the fact that there are others out there like me that find the whole transportation situation in our modern world one of the biggest, dumbest spectacles that this planet will ever have the misfortune of witnessing.",

Any city &gt;5 million people metro downtown that insist on car reliance as a method of transport are simply looking for a population sustainability issue given how inefficient car is regarding of the use of very precious space (parking, congestion).\n2. Cars use case is mostly rural where the density isn\u0019t justifying the public transport except for the cheapest &amp; most unreliable one possible and the land is on discount.\n3. EV crank it to 11 because rural electricity is by it\u0019s nature is subsidized by city where the density allow cheaper electricity (thanks to economy of scale) which enables said city grid to subsidize the area around the city (the suburbs) but any city that know what they\u0019re doing (Tokyo, Amsterdam, most German city, Paris, London, Singapore) know that suburbs still have to be given a coverage of public transport because eventually people that lived in suburbs works in the metro and if they\u0019re allowed to bring in their cars it will cause the same problem with the car ownership in the downtown regardless of the legality of owning cars in downtown.\n\nWhy cars are oversaturated:\n1. We never have a actual invention of new car technology since Hybrids (EV first prototype was more than century old) which made the technological barrier to this industry relatively small compared to let\u0019s say a chip fab.\n2. Which makes every country down to the low income countries that have a industrial base like China, Russia &amp; India to be able to make their own cars (albeit with varied success in capturing the market share).\n3. Compound that with some country like China, Japan, South Korea implementing textbook fascism and transfer everything (including confiscated bank deposit (in China case)) to the manufacturing of cars to make sure that there\u0019s no mass unemployment regardless of the demand of said cars &amp; the other car producing countries reaction to said textbook fascism move.

      "text": "I'm in a UK city so we have pretty good transport links. My typical commute would be 20 mins on an electric tram for around £3/day and I like doing puzzles/reading the paper to relax. I don't drive because I can usually get to somewhere faster on the train anyway.\n\nOver lockdown my work assigned me to a job working with a client's team. I like the work but the car-centric office location is pushing me to the brink where I'm considering quitting!\n\nTheir office is on a massive industrial estate that's a spaghetti mess of dual carriageways (70mph with no pavements).\n\nDay 1 I arrived by catching a train to the nearest railway station. It's only a mile from the office so I planned to walk. I soon found out that there is no safe walking route due to these high speed roads and I ended up taking 50 mins to get there by taking a shortcut through some bushes...\n\nI asked around at the office to see if anyone knew of a better walking route (surely there must be one?!) to find that NONE of them had ever even tried commuting by rail. There are more than enough parking spaces for everyone to come in their own car.\n\nHowever, somebody tipped me off that there is a shuttle bus from the office to the railway station. I searched for it online and found a massive publicity piece about how the company is committed to sustainability and helping people travel by train etc. etc.. only to look at the timetable and see that there are 3 times in the morning around 9am and 3 times in the afternoon around 4pm, so I can't even do a full working day.\n\nI find it so frustrating that this company just wants to pay lip service to their sustainability stance but can't even put on a reasonable bus service.\n\nUnfortunately I now have to take a taxi from the station to the office even though it's such a short distance.\n\nI spoke to my boss about this issue and how impractical it is and his solution?    \"Just buy a car\"",

      "title": "Unpopular opinion : high speed rail is overhyped",
      "text": "Some examples : \n\n- France's TGV is often perceived as a prime example the US should strive for concerning high speed rail. And for the most part, it is. If you travel between Paris and another major city. Yes, Paris-Marseille (over 800km) in 3 hours is an awesome feat of technology, planning, and politics, and yes, you can do that for 10¬ in low cost subsidized TGVs. BUT. French TGV lines were built at the cost of the pre-existing densely networked classical speed train lines. If you don't live in a major urban center, and by this i really mean one of the biggest french cities, the train may be 3 times faster than 50 years ago, but it doesn't stop in your town anymore, you lost to the change. The french train network is now a nightmarish Paris-entered radial system, that basically forces you to take a car if you want to travel between two non-Paris places. A network of local trains still exists, but nothing as dense as 50 years ago.\n\n- China is often praised in this sub for having developed an extensive hsr system in 10 years. Good. But now, even subsidized, the ticket is too expensive for the average Chinese people. Most people taking these routes uses cheaper, classical speed trains, leaving the hs trains empty. Now, China struggle to repay the debt it contracted for building these lines, and the oldest ones are slowly falling in disrepair. Imagine how good of a network China could have today if that money was used to build a classical speed network, deserving many of the small town of the continent size country, that Chinese people could actually afford to travel on. And where the ticket money could actually pay for maintenance. But no, because China wanted a vanity project that would be talked about internationally (and on this front, they succeeded), and classical trains are not sexy enough for that. (Disclaimer: never been to China, argument based on secondary sources)\n\n- I will not comment on Germany and Spain, as I have not travelled there often. I was told Ice and Ave where good, but I suspect they would be subject to issues similar than the ones in France.\n\n- Most notably: I will not comment on the Shinkansen. I know it is considered as the best hsr system, but I have no idea on the state of the Japanese local train network. And by now you know my opinion: hsr means nothing if there is no solid, dense underlying rail network.\n\n- On the other hand : Switzerland is hands down the queen of public transportation, especially rural transportation. Any town with at least 500 inhabitants -&gt; railway station. Even town smaller than that often have one. And railway station means a MINIMUM of an hourly service in each direction. Aside from that, EVERY population center, how small it may be, is serviced by at least one bus stop, and bus lines also have an hourly minimum frequency. Meaning that, living in Switzerland, even in the most remote of areas, you never need a car. And for those who would argue that this is only possible because of how densely populated the country is : 200 hab/km^2. Yes, it is a dense country, but this is the same density than the UK or Germany. And despite that, city center to city center travel is still faster by train than by car. Oh. And 100% railway electrification. Switzerland achieved that without a single piece of track over 200 km/h.\n\nAs a lot of people in this sub are Americans, my final argument is : Of course I want sustainable transportation without the need of cars. But to achieve that effectively, america should not strive for hsr, they should want these billions to be invested in a dense network of classical speed trains, with better service for the community. Yes, HSR is a nice convenience, especially in a country as large as the US. But transcontinental train travel is just a sweet dream for now, and all the lines where hsr makes sense now could be serviced by solid sleeper trains, with more frequent stops and more frequent trains. For the same price and the same quantity of political battling, you need to chose between frequent train, servicing every town, or a few speedy bois, very convenient for city center people, but of no use for everyone else. I'll root for the former any day of my life. It may be less flashy, but it is better for nearly everyone in their everyday life.\n\nTL;DR : HSR is the icing on the cake for a public transportation system. If many places focused on making a decent cake before worrying about the icing, rail transport would be better for almost everyone.",

      "title": "Americans are Spoiled",
      "text": "I know this post is going to be controversial, but we need to be realistic. Americans by and large consume a disproportionate amount of resources compared to people in other parts of the world. if Everyone had American levels of consumption we would need 2 - 3 additional Earths to sustain it. \n\nAmericans dislike traffic, noise, pollution, ever widening roads and other negative externalities that cars create but most dislike any policies that would reduce the number of cars. Whether it be allowing businesses to not build parking, mind you not forcing them, or imposing congestion pricing on roads or converting roads and streets into bus lanes. Americans dislike the disruptions road maintenance and road widening create even though these are necessary to accommodate larger amounts of cars. \n\nAmericans dislike a lot of the negative externalities sprawl creates such as the loss of open space, so we will create urban growth boundaries and zone land for farming to try to fix this. Then we continue impose limits to density such as height restrictions, single family zoning, setback requirements, parking requirements, and so forth and there is heavy resistance to changing any of these policies. We do these things and wonder why housing in unaffordable and why we still have negative externalities from sprawl that is created elsewhere.  Many people don't want housing to be affordable even if it means a lack of workers for services they use or lack of maids or requiring those people to do 2 - 3 hour commutes.\n\nPeople will fight against expanding transit to their areas because it will bring \"bad elements\", even if those are the workers who services they depend on. They'll use every environmental regulation under the sun to delay transit projects even if the objections are bogus. People will even vote for transit expansion some times but will complain about any temporary disruption construction creates even if it will eventually go away. \n\nI am guilty of this one (though I am working on it), we eat way more than we need to and throw away perfectly good food.\n\nWe constantly buy and throw away perfectly good electronics.\n\nAmericans dislike high energy prices but live lifestyles that waste vast quantities of energy. Everything from using dryers instead of hanging clothes, not daylighting buildings and running lights during the day, ever increasing house sizes, and driving cars that are less fuel efficient than what are available. For reference the average US is fuel efficiency is 25 mpg. Most people don't realistically need large trucks or SUVS to get around. Even when transit is available and is practical to use people will choose not to use it.\n\nAmericans want \"alternative energy sources\" but then complain when they actually get built that they have some sort of issues. No energy source is perfect, but Americans basically expect electricity production with zero externalities, which is not practical.  And when they complain about something that has zero externalities, they never bother to think of using less energy.\n\nAmericans complain about a lack of industrial jobs, but we basically expect industries to create zero externalities. \n\nSo the long and short of it is that higher gas prices suck for the average person, this I fully understand and I have to deal with myself. However, Americans by and large only dislike the negative affects of their lifestyle choices, they don't dislike the lifestyle choices that create these negative affects. Americans need to realize that if they want the negative externalities and economics costs of their lifestyles to go away, they need to live different lifestyles and not simply hope that their lifestyles will some how stop doing this to them. We shouldn't look at Americans as victims, but rather as participants. We shouldn't blame governments for implementing policies that most of their citizens want. And this isn't meant to create some sort of moral high ground, but simply to deal with reality. We should also use these high gas prices as opportunity to change people's thinking and change people's actions. People both need to feel the pain their lifestyle choices create and need to understand the source of it.",

      "text": "https://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/64535\n\n&gt; **Sinn Féin publish plan for a safer, affordable, more accessible public transport system**\n\n&gt; Sinn Féin spokesperson on Transport, Representative Darren O\u0019Rourke TD, today published his party\u0019s plan to invest significantly in our public transport system in order to help to drive down carbon emissions and create a safer, affordable, more accessible public transport network.\n\n&gt; The Meath East TD said:\n\n&gt; \u001cIn order to encourage more people onto public transport, we need to address the underlying problems of cost, accessibility and safety.\n\n&gt; \u001cThe price of a train journey for a family can be prohibitive, while the monthly cost of commuting is eating into the already stretched finances of workers.\n\n&gt; \u001cSinn Féin are proposing to make the 20% fare reduction permanent and cut the cost of tickets for under 18s by 50%. This would make public transport more attractive and affordable, for more people.\n\n&gt; \u001cWe are calling for the 20% fare reduction to be extended to Commercial Bus Operators, who provide important connectivity in the regions, but who have been forgotten about by this government.\n\n&gt; \u001cWe also want to address the lack of public transport options in rural Ireland.\n\n&gt; \u001cOur rail network is a skeleton of what it once was, and we want to address this. In addition to the NDP projects, we are committing to delivering the Navan Rail Line and Western Rail Corridor.\n\n&gt; \u001cCombined these projects would deliver important new connectivity and provide for an additional 2,375,000 sustainable passenger journeys each year, delivering significant benefits for the regions and our environment.\n\n&gt; \u001cFor those living in rural Ireland accessing services, employment and education is difficult if not impossible, without using a private car. \n\n&gt; \u001cTherefore, we are proposing an acceleration of the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural bus plan, to give rural communities more transport options.\n\n&gt; \u001cFor those with a disability, using public transport can still be a nightmare. Broken lifts, inaccessible bus stops or having to give 24 hours\u0019 notice of travel is still a reality for many.\n\n&gt; \u001cOver a five-year period, we would deliver the total investment needed to make our train stations, bus stations and bus stops fully wheelchair accessible.\n\n&gt; \u001cWe also need to address the anti-social behaviour that puts people off using buses, trams and trains. Therefore, instead of just talking about it, we have included proposals to establish a public transport policing unit.\n \n&gt; \u001cOur progressive proposals show that we can cut emissions, whilst also delivering social and economic benefits for citizens at the same time.\u001d\n\n&gt; Sinn Féin's 'Driving down emissions with public transport' proposals can be [read here.](https://mcusercontent.com/ffc5ff2fa2294c89d2ff7598e/files/2c683eca-d04f-e7a3-99f1-cc5cd045d3eb/Driving_down_emissions_with_public_transport.pdf)\n\nIt\u0019s not the exact merits of these proposals that\u0019s interesting so much as  the fact the largest party in Ireland is trying to outbid the governing coalition - which includes the Irish Green Party - on sustainable transport. At least rhetorically.\n\nProbably means there\u0019s no prospect of pro-car elements attempting to reverse the current direction of travel in Irish politics.",

      "text": "We often look at the issues surrounding car ownership with the relation to things like&\n\n* environmental sustainability \n\n* health and wellness\n\n* city infrastructure \n\n* more free time\n\n* etc.\n\nBut I want to talk about it in the realm of how the state can use this car dependency as a way to more effectively control its citizens, and how it connects with the larger issue of criminal justice reform. \n\nIn the book \"Usual Cruelty: The Complicity of Lawyers in the Criminal Injustice System\" by Alec Karakatsanis (2019), the author makes several interesting points regarding arrests for \u001cdriving with a suspended license\u001d. The linked sources are from the Notes section of the book\n\n\u001c[M]any jurisdictions, the single most common criminal prosecution is for [driving with a suspended license](http://www.chronline.com/crime/state-senators-propose-reform-for-driving-with-suspended-license-law/article_2996cdf8-f824-11e7-bd9e-ff4084d58384.html), and about [forty percent of suspended American drivers\u0019 licenses were taken away not for any reason related to driving, but because a person was too poor to pay court debts](https://www.npr.org/2015/01/05/37269-1918/how-drivers-license-suspensions-unfairly-target-the-poor).\u001d\n\n\u001cCalifornia took away [4.2 million drivers\u0019 licenses](https://www.lccr.com/wp-content/uploads/Not-Just-a-Ferguson-Problem-How-Traffic-Courts-Drive-Inequality-in-California-4.8.15.pdf) because people could not pay court debts. In the past five years, Tennessee took away [more than 250,000 licenses for inability to pay tickets and more than 140,000 licenses for inability to pay other court debts](https://dailymemphian.com/article/740/Court-orders-state-to-stop-suspending-licenses-of-people-too-poor-to-pay-debt). Because dozens of states have done the same thing, millions more people have lost the ability to do all of the things many of us take for granted in life\u0014go to the grocery store, attend church, commute to work, and visit family\u0014as \u001cdriving on a suspended license\u001d has [become one of the most commonly charged crimes by prosecutors in many jurisdictions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/more-than-7-million-people-may-have-lost-drivers-licenses-because-of-traffic-debt/2018/05/19/9767-8c08-5785-11e8-b656-a5f8c2a9295d_story.html). **In such circumstances, that crime serves no function other than to criminalize poverty.**\u001d (Emphasis added by me)\n\nWhy would the state want to discourage people from driving cars when it\u0019s such an effective way to throw more people into the criminal justice system? It\u0019s a highly lucrative business. The prison system is literally state-controlled slavery. It\u0019s a multi-billion dollar industry (bail bondsmen, court costs, police, jails, prisons, etc). And it needs fresh bodies every day to keep it running.\n\nIf more people had access to public transportation, it would mean less people being tossed into the open maw of this \u001cpunishment bureaucracy\u001d as the author calls it. \n\nKeep this in mind when you hear things like \u001cbail reform\u001d and other issues related to criminal justice reform. It might not have to do with cars directly, but it\u0019s all connected.",

      "title": "Concern over increase in anti e-scooter propaganda in Australian media",
      "text": "I attempted to post this article in r/Australia though had it deleted with no reason given, so figured I'd preach it to the choir instead :-) \n\nTL:DR at end.\n\nRecently there have been a flood of articles in Australian media with titles like \"Concerns increase in fires linked to lithium-ion batteries in e-scooters and e-bikes\". One online ABC article about the issue was originally posted with the false statement that \"Hundreds of e-scooters and e-bikes are catching fire in Australian homes...\" That wildly inaccurate bit of information has since been removed, but not before a [Google crawler indexed it.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hundreds+of+e-scooters+and+e-bikes+are+catching+fire+in+Australian+homes)\n\nDespite media reports to the contrary, e-scooters and e-bikes are not bursting into flames at an alarming rate. Over 5.5 years to mid 2022, there were less than 100 lithium-ion battery fires in Australia reported to the ACCC; remember, a dozen or more lithium-ion battery containing products can be found in the average Australian home today, including in laptops, tablets, children's toys, drills, etc. [Only 9 (yes nine) of those fires were caused by batteries inside e-mobility devices.](https://consultation.accc.gov.au/accc/lithium-ion-batteries-issues-paper/supporting_documents/ACCC%20Lithiumion%20Batteries%20Issues%20Paper.pdf) Nine e-scooter and e-bike fires over 5.5 years, compared to 10's of thousands of car fires over the same period (speculative based on [&gt;9,000 car fires in NSW alone in just a 36-month period](https://www.fireextinguisheronline.com.au/blog/post/electric-vehicle-fire-extinguisher-australia)).\n\nSo why the media frenzy on these devices being a risk? Vehicle manufacturers and energy companies have been manipulating the media and controlling the narrative around transport options for 100 years now ([reference 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOttvpjJvAo), [reference 2](https://www.drilledpodcast.com/)), they are world renowned experts at [manufacturing consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU).\n\nIn urban areas, a substantial amount of the distance we drive is for short trips, easily achievable by e-mobility devices. In Sydney, [50% of all vehicle km driven are for trips less than 5km](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/HTS%20Report%20Sydney%202012-13.pdf). If we are allowed to view new e-mobility options as the cheap, convenient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly, spatially sustainable, and relatively safe products that they are, then we'll stop driving cars as much as we do. In turn, we'd also start demanding governments do more to make our streets safer for those who aren't driving cars... which in turn will cause more people take up alternative transport options.\n\nLeft unchecked, e-mobility devices have the potential to significantly reduce the amount we drive cars in our cities; this will hurt the bottom line of amongst the richest and most powerful businesses in the world. Something they will not allow to happen without a fight. Their decades old signature move? Narrative control and media manipulation.\n\nTL:DR; E-scooters and e-bikes are not catching fire at the rate the media is portraying, not even remotely. It is likely the usual powers are at work to ensure the general public are terrified of any transport option that is not a privately owned car.",

      "text": "Hey everyone it\u0019s my first text post here so sorry if I come off as ignorant. I\u0019m a very big fan of dense, mixed used, urban, transit oriented development, like many of you all. \n\nA question I\u0019ve been thinking of is with the current state of affairs with the housing market exploding and demand being at an all time high, why are cities not making use of what I\u0019m seeing as an effective blank check for development, and rushing to capitalize on this demand as fast as possible.\n\nAny city that wanted to become a world class city could essentially do that right now, with an almost guaranteed return on their investment. Through massive amounts of new development, of which the demand would instantly eat up all units made, any city would gain a sustainable new tax base that could fund many insane expansions for their public transportation systems, and other quality of life improvements. While also making cities more affordable.\n\nWhile cities are developing, the rate at which they are given the current climate is confusing. I would remove pretty much all barriers to building mixed use developments as quickly as possible and capitalize on that demand before the market would return to normal.\n\nThe demand for walkable, urban environments is clearly there. The question is, why aren\u0019t cities doing this?",

      "title": "It's Inevitable That America Will Abandon Car Dependency",
      "text": "And not by choice, either, nor some form of climate or oil disaster. It's an impending economic certainty. And we can move things along.\n\nAmerica has been on a dangerous slope of global rising prices - and cars are just one of those core issues, one we can hopefully control.\n\nEach year, more economic power has been funneled upwards from the lower and middle class and into the hands of rich. In fact, the wealth divide has [grown to levels last seen in the Great Depression.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-been-almost-a-100-years-since-the-americas-1-had-so-much-wealth-2019-02-11) At this rate, our taxes simply won't be able to keep up.\n\nAs the dollar value decreases for each American, and the cost of maintaining car infrastructure grows, it's not likely that future car dependent sprawl can be sustained by sourcing yet more land and development for Federal tax revenue. Especially as cities go through a phase of economic decline from the impending recession, the Federal Government can not hope to outspend time itself in the midst of a economic crash.\n\nWhat is likely to happen is that once the bubble pops, it may put a large pause on new construction and development in major cities, and cut off typical maintenance for excessive roads when the funds run dry. This is what causes cities to go bankrupt; the revenue of new developments stagnates, and investors demand their dues. This has happened dozens of times before, as cities tend to ebb and flow with new construction every year; but a threat like this could drastically reduce growth, and massively impact cities for years to come. This would lead to a gap in repairs, maintenance, and upgrades, causing roads to quickly fall into dysfunction if not properly maintained. And with the growing rise of anti-car pedestrians, and growing pedestrian culture, this could be an opportune moment to swing development towards a more sustainable, affordable future.\n\nOne of the core arguments for Pro-Pedestrian infrastructure is the vastly decreased cost; bike lanes and large sidewalks don't need excessive maintenance, are cheaper to build, and can last far longer than any road could hope for. Couple this with an impending economic downturn that would personally affect many Americans, and ridership of cars may actually plummet once again in favor of cheaper options. This would be a key moment for local Governments to consider blighted road infrastructure for an overhaul.\n\nWe can further speed along this change by using this collapse wisely. Car-centered development is too costly for a country out of its prime to maintain. America is not in its prime any longer; that is becoming abundantly clear, and if things don't change, they will risk a massive decline in quality of life and businesses will find it hard to weather the storm. Not to mention, more and more people will be marooned without hope of transit.\n\nSo, if you're planning on staying in America for an event like this, I'd recommend writing letters to your city council, your mayor, your governor - what have you, starting right now. Make it a monthly deal; one day of every month, take the time to send an email, a letter, a call to your local politicians and demand change. Here's some key issues you could include in your grievances (best to write these out yourself, even just a few short sentences will get you places).\n\n1. The city could benefit immensely by replacing cluttered roads with more walkable corridors. This would decrease traffic in the surrounding area, and increase the quality of life and health of the residents at the same time.\n2. Removing single family housing, minimum parking requirements, and investing into infill development could both dramatically increase tax revenue, increase emergency response time, and lower the average cost of maintenance in the area dramatically. By increasing city density, you decrease the amount of land services must cover - including electric, water, sewer, runoff, gas, and all forms of emergency service like police and firefighters.\n3. The majority of all trips in America are done by car, and are under 2 miles away from the home of the individual traveling. Removing the need for a car in these two mile strips by adding segregated biking lanes would reduce emissions and save wear and tear on existing roads by simply reducing traffic.\n4. Public transit is a large cost up front, which pays for itself over time, even with maintenance included. By implementing trams, buses, subways, and trains within the city, you could connect hubs of commerce and improve the driving experience for those who choose to drive - by simply removing drivers off of the road.\n5. You increase the independence of the residents in the area by giving more pedestrian oriented options, as this allows even handicapped residents some form of freedom of movement.\n6. You would reduce drunk driving incidences in areas with mixed use development, especially if you remove driving as an option in that area.\n7. The majority of city dwellers are already within walking distance of their most common destinations, but can not feasibly walk anywhere due to the sheer overabundance of car infrastructure. Implementing bigger and safer sidewalks and dedicated biking infrastructure would see an increase in pedestrians and decrease in cars on any road. \n8. Reducing parking lot sizes of large stores does not impact their business if there are other methods to reach this store efficiently.\n9. Transit times should be on par with cars, to ensure high ridership. The more individuals opting for transit, the less damage to the city's roads, the less in costs of maintenance the city has to pay.\n\nYou can find your representative [here.](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)\n\nYou can find ALL officials above you [here.](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials)\n\nThis is an honest effort.

      "text": "I recently adventured across Europe and the Northeast for most of 2023 and enjoyed the walkability and transit of these places a lot. Coming home to Houston for the holidays, however, I can't help but feel like it feels greener. Walkable cities have parks but the rest of the cities, the non-park part, feel very devoid of any nature. I was walking through the suburbs in Houston and while the stroads and strip malls were gross, I did appreciate the green space from the opulent lawns, grassy medians on the stroads, and the mini-gardens+trees lining the parking lots. I know lawns are unsustainable but that green space could be replaced with sustainable perennial greens. I just appreciate that it exists for my viewing pleasure.\n\nI find this hard to reconcile. I want to like walkable cities more but I really crave seeing trees and green, and not just at a few parks or a few urban lonely trees sticking out of concrete. I want to see it interspersed throughout the city. Then I don't have to go to a park necessarily to get my green fix.\n\nWhy does it feel this way? Can anything be done to fix it?",

In reality **50% of palm oil is used as fuel for cars and trucks.**\n\nSource: [https://te-cdn.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/Food-vs-Fuel\\_-Part-2\\_Vegetable-oils-in-biofuels.pdf](https://te-cdn.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/Food-vs-Fuel_-Part-2_Vegetable-oils-in-biofuels.pdf)\n\nSome quotes from that document that is a few years old now but probably still pretty accurate:\n\n\"18% of the world\u0019s vegetable oil production goes to ~~bio~~diesel. Nearly all of which is fit for human consumption. \\[...\\] Europe alone burns over 17,000 tonnes of rapeseed and sunflower oil every day - the equivalent of nearly 19 million bottles of best cooking oil, every single day.\"\n\n\"The amount of palm and soy [who\u0019s a *literal* soyboy now?] oil burned each year \\[in the EU\\] (4.7 Mt) is equivalent to yet another **14 million bottles per day**. In 2018, most of the palm oil used for biodiesel originated from Indonesia (65%)\u001d\n\nBiofuel feedstocks grown on land cleared from tropical forests, such as soybeans in the Amazon and oil palm in Southeast Asia, **generate particularly high greenhouse gases emissions** (Fargione, J., et al. 2008. \u001cLand clearing and the biofuel carbon debt.\u001d *Science* 319: 1235\u00131238.)

Fertilizer application releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Most biorefineries operate using fossil fuels. Some research suggests that GHG emissions resulting from biofuel production and use, including those from indirect land use change, may be higher than those generated by fossil fuels, depending on the time horizon of the analysis [(Melillo et al. 2009, Mosnier et al. 2013)](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/economics-biofuels).\"\n\nI will stop calling any fuel \"bio\" and I will enjoy my Nutella spread thank you very much.",

Basically they were saying stuff like people who drive electric cars should only be able to power them with solar and wind, if you are giving up fossil fuels you have to 100% give them up.  Overall making fun on anyone who cares about the environment because we all use and consume stuff and so aren't we just laughable hypocrites.\n\nI said i actually don't think electric cars will solve our environmental problems or help us develop more sustainable cities.  I said i don't feel people that own them are inherently better, some people buy them for status symbols, I know they take up energy and batteries have mined lithium.  I said better planning of cities and development where less people have to use cars and getting less cars on the road is a more important goal.  It could even make it better for those who want to drive and emergency vehicles if there is less traffic.\n\nStill I get most people currently in the US have to deal with a reality where you have to drive.  I'm not the one judging someone for having a car, electric or not, i don't know their situation.  And the state of our electric grid is not an individual person's fault even if we can make the choice to use less energy.  I overheat easy and I live in Florida, I'm using AC.  I like that options for different kind of vehicles exist, we need to look at all options even if i don't think it is THE solution and that ultimately we need less cars.  And that i don't like the idea that if you can't be perfect it is not worth doing something at all. \n\nBoth of my comments got a laugh react from them.  \n\nI can't explain how much it hurts to try so hard to be reasonable and understanding and get laugh reacts.  People can be assholes and carbrain society is just one thing making it worse.  But it really hurts and i don't think any people anywhere else will care about my feelings from this exchange.",

      "title": "Antwerp, Belgium: How we made cars secondary and life better",
      "text": "I know this sub is largely US-centered, but I wanted to share the perspective from Antwerp, Belgium\u0014a mid-sized city (around 500k) with a large port and a bustling ring road that\u0019s part of a major European transport artery. The ring road is almost always clogged with cargo trucks, but the real story lies in the city center.\n\nAntwerp used to be all about cars. Traffic choked the streets, even in the medieval heart of the city. But then, things began to change. People started using bikes. And the city responded. They built a station-based bike-sharing system, and even a right-wing administration saw the advantages of this shift (even though they still shy away from being openly anti-car). They introduced \"zone 30\" streets (where the speed limit is 30 km/h) and \"bike streets,\" where cars are guests and not allowed to pass bikes.\n\nFast forward to today, and it's amazing how the streets have transformed. Electric bikes, cargo bikes, and longtails are everywhere, and it\u0019s now a common sight to see cars moving slowly, adjusting to the new flow of traffic that\u0019s largely led by cyclists.\n\nLast year, we went car-free as a family. My older sons, who are 12 and 10, bike to school independently, and my youngest, who\u0019s only five, rides his own bike to school with me (helmet on, of course). My wife commutes to work (about 10 km) on her electric bike.\n\nWhile we all have our own bikes, we also make use of Antwerp\u0019s growing bike-sharing systems: Velo (a station-based city bike system), Donkey Republic (electric bikes), and Cargoroo (cargo bike sharing). When we really need a car, we use one of two car-sharing services: Cambio (where you return the car to its pick-up point) or Poppy (where you can drop it off in any participating city). Not once have we been unable to get a car when needed, and it\u0019s far more flexible. If I need a small car, I get a small car. Need a van for moving stuff? No problem. When the family heads out for a weekend, I can get a spacious hatchback.\n\nAnd yes, we do save a lot of money. I calculated that we used to spend about ¬500 a month on total car costs (depreciation, taxes, insurance, fuel, repairs). Now, we rent out our underground parking spot and use the rent to cover all our car rentals. We\u0019re literally saving over ¬500 every month with zero loss of comfort. Plus, no more worries about breakdowns, accidents, or unexpected repair costs.\n\nBut honestly, the savings aren\u0019t even the best part. I\u0019ve read that not owning a car is one of the most impactful things you can do for the environment. It feels good to know that we\u0019re contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future, and it\u0019s incredibly empowering to live without being dependent on a car.\n\nI can honestly say I *love* my car-free life now. The freedom, the savings, and the simplicity have been life-changing.",

      "title": "The Dark Side of Convenience: How Cars Contribute to Increased Disposal",
      "text": "Hey Reddit community,\n\nToday, I want to talk about a topic that caught my attention during my recent move and got me thinking. It's about the impact of cars on our tendency to simply throw things away instead of reusing or recycling them.\n\nRecently, I moved out of my old apartment and took the opportunity to reevaluate my possessions. I either sold or gave away nearly everything, and only disposed of very few items that were truly beyond repair. I realized that the main reason behind this was my lack of mobility - or rather, my dependence on a car.\n\nImagine if I had had a car. The temptation to toss everything into the trunk and drive it to the landfill would have been significant. It definitely would have been easier, but at what cost? A functional toaster, a chair that could be easily fixed, maybe even a part of my old bookshelf - all of these things could have been abandoned rather than given a second chance.\n\nIt's alarming to realize how much cars can influence our attitude towards reuse and sustainability. The convenience they offer often leads us to take the path of least resistance, even when it comes to disposing of things. This raises the question of how many valuable resources we waste simply because it's easier to get rid of something instead of repairing or passing it on.\n\nLet's discuss: How can we better utilize the convenience of cars without falling into the trap of a disposable culture? How can we shape our consumption habits to waste less and develop greater appreciation for the things we own?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences on this topic!\n\n**TL;DR:** My move showed me how cars can lead us to thoughtlessly discard items instead of preserving or recycling them. The convenience of cars often tempts us to take the easy way out and dispose of things rather than giving them a second chance. Let's discuss how to overcome this disposable culture.",

      "text": "[*Winkler, Lisa, et al. \"The effect of sustainable mobility transition policies on cumulative urban transport emissions and energy demand.\" Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 2357, 24 Apr. 2023, pp. 1-14, doi:10.1038/s41467-023-37728-x.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37728-x)\n\n&gt;Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. \n\n---------------------\n\nRelevant [Chart](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37728-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_37728_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)\n\n&gt;Cumulative emissions (a) and energy demand (b) between 2020 and 2050 is shown for the baseline case and each policy applied onto the baseline case, as well as the local transport policy for London and a combined case consisting of all policies acting together. Emission projections are compared with the Tyndall Centre\u0019s estimate of the carbon budget (for well below 2\t°C and pursuing 1.5\t°C)46 multiplied by the historical percentage of London\u0019s emissions from cars47 and the CCC\u0019s cumulative emissions pathway for 1.5\t°C for surface transport10 multiplied by the historic percentage of UK surface transport emissions arising from London cars (see Supplementary Note 1). Emissions and energy demand are categorised by their source; the fossil fuel energy and tailpipe emissions from ICEVs (black), the electricity consumed for driving EVs (blue), the well-to-tank emissions from fuels (grey), the embedded emissions and energy from EVs (red) and ICEVs (orange) and the emissions and energy from retrofitting ICEVs with electric engines (purple). Note: the Tyndall carbon budget is in units of MtCO2 and does not account for other greenhouse gases, so it is a slight underestimate of the entire CO2eq budget.\n\n-------\n\nOther relevant parts:\n\n&gt;The least effective policy outcome in our considered portfolio is faster electrification; advancing the full phase out of fossil fuel cars, including hybrids, by 2030 reduces cumulative emissions by less than 3%. Advancing this phase out to 2025 only results in an emissions reduction of 5.9% compared to the baseline policy that already assumes a phase-out date of 2030 for ICEVs and 2035 for hybrids. Thus, advancing the phase-out date forward by 5 years only affects new cars bought in this 5-year period. As this is a small percentage of the existing fleet and of all the cars manufactured in the period of 2020\u00132050, the emissions reduction potential associated with moving the phase-out date forward by 5 years is relatively small. Furthermore, whilst tailpipe emissions are decreased by 16%, the electricity emissions are increased by 19% for the 2025 phase-out case compared to the baseline case. Thus, without rapid decarbonisation of the electrical grid used to power EVs, emissions savings from early phase-out are counteracted by emissions from a largely fossil-fuel dependent electrical grid as well as emissions from EV manufacture.\n\n&gt;Embedded emissions of BEVs can be reduced by 42% through implementing stricter manufacturing standards. These regulations refer to the strict emissions standards that can be set on the manufacture of the batteries (responsible for a large proportion of a BEV\u0019s lifecycle emissions and energy consumption due to the high shares of fossil fuels used in the regions where most battery cells are produced30) and other components of an electric vehicle. Thus, manufacturing cars with greater amounts of renewable energy as well as using less emissions intensive manufacturing processes such as recycled content and heat recovery, results in an overall cumulative emissions reduction of 18.4%. Policies should therefore incentivise the operation of EV battery recycling and manufacturing on a national level, where jurisdiction is possible over the energy sources and manufacturing practices used.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Tailpipe emissions (black bars in Fig. 1a) represent the largest proportion of cumulative emissions in the combined policy cases and a key area for mitigation. In the baseline case, 78% of these tailpipe emissions are caused by cars in the existing fleet made pre-2020 rather than new cars introduced in the period of 2020\u00132050. In the combined policies cases, 99% of the tailpipe emissions stem from the existing fleet. Hence, it is the exhaust emissions from cars on the road today living out their life that are responsible for 68% of the total emissions in the combined case and that are using up more than 92% of the carbon budget, even if disruptive policies are implemented. Therefore, policies solely focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of new cars cannot be sufficient in achieving climate targets without introducing regulations that target the existing fleet. **This can be done through measures that encourage less driving (e.g., modal shift), retrofits of the existing fleet, fuel-saving driver behaviour (e.g., optimal speed travel, which is not modelled in this study) and potentially low carbon synthetic fuels, although their impact on emissions is not established.**\n\n\n&gt;A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to achieve short-term emissions targets, meet stringent carbon budgets that limit temperature rise to 2\t°C at most and to not create excessive demand for additional technology, material, and minerals. Our analysis demonstrates that relying on efficiency and electrification policies takes too long due to the turnover time of the fleet, even with the ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles moved forward and accelerated scrapping of ICEVs. This is because the vast majority of carbon emissions that fill up the remaining carbon budget originate from cars that already exist. Policies that can reduce these emissions include retrofitting the existing fleet with electric engines and reducing the distance driven by cars. Policy efforts should put increasing emphasis on mitigating emissions from cars that exist today rather than solely focussing on the electrification of new cars.\n\n----\n\nRelevant GIF: https://tenor.com/zD1N.gif",

      "text": "So back in 2014 the EU proposed to build a 60 Km train line between the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and the tourism hotspot that is Maspalomas in the south of the island, going through the airport and some other important places. A 60 Km train line that supposedly costs 1,550 million euro, money that would be covered by the EU and the rest of it would have to be done by the locals.\n\nThe project has been stuck as an idea for 8 years now and the ULPGC (University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) posted an article stating the  main reasons as to why it won't work:\n\n1.\"The project would not be economically sustainable.\" Because having a train built essentially for free is apparently expensive and having over 4 million tourists using a line which would connect them directly to either the capital of the island and the tourism sector would not be economically sustainable, as well as every person using the clogged-up highway to go to work every day. \n\n2.\"Not enough people would use it.\" Maybe not everyone would use the train, but that is because, in Gran Canaria, we really don't have decent public transport. We are slowly getting there but we still have a very car-centric infrastructure. Being honest, having a train along the most concurred route in the whole island does not seem like a bad idea, taking into account the massive ammount of tourists, too.\n\n3. And this one is painfully stupid, \"It wouldn't be environmentally sustainable.\" Like, how? It is a train and it would be powered by renewables, I know they are not a complete saviour, but we have so many windy days. I really don't know how a \"trustworthy\" institution got to this conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, we don't have a train because we have lazy and blind politicians who only do projects so that they can get a part of the budget. Like they are doing with the MetroGuagua, a BRT system which should have been finished way over 2 years ago but is still 40% complete, and the bike lane network which only exisits in the lower part of the city.",

      "title": "Urbanism postulates",
      "text": "Let's try to summarize what we want by a number of postulates. I will edit and add more when they come to mind. Feel free to add in the comments, or if you think it can be better, let me know as well. I want to make a short friendly summary for others to read.\n\nUrbanism postulates:\n\n1. Better cities. Cities without cars or with minimal number of cars are simply better, safer, nicer, quieter etc. City centers, especially historic city centers should be car-free (exception only for services).\n\n2. Safety. Tens of thousands of people die every year being hit by a car. By a simple virtue of there being fewer moving cars while the rest is moving slower we can help that. Next best thing is to have better, non-car-centric infrastructure.\n\n3. Efficiency of space, energy and cost. 2 cars take up as much space as a 50-person bus when travelling at speed, while only being able to carry 10 people and in reality only carrying 2. Bus is also more energy efficient per Capita and puts less wear on the road. In all these statistics a bus is absolutely smoked by a train.\n\n4. Noise pollution. You don't experience it mostly, when in a car, but outside it is bad. It quickly deteriorates mental health when sustained. Can be massively improved by having fewer cars while the remaining travel slower. Electric buses are quieter.\n\n5. Cost. Owning a car is expensive and maintaining car infrastructure is costly and inefficient. Think about it. You can fit a small house in a space the same size as 8 parking spaces. Parking requirements, roads and car-centric development force people to live further away from places of interest, so it takes away other options. It's simply a siphon for oil and car companies to suck money away from people and the government.\n\n6. Energy efficiency and climate crisis. Better and efficient cities, commuting mainly by foot, bike or public transport improves our chances to still have a liveable planet in 50 years.\n\n7. Health. Bike and walking vs car travel. Less cancerous car exhaust pollution. Nuff said. Also mental health improved by less noise pollution, simply nicer cities and less strain on finances.\n\nUrbanism does not postulate:\n\n1. Forcing you out of your cars. We want to first provide options for those who don't want to drive places but currently have to due to lack of other options. These include but are not limited to better bike infrastructure, walkable neighborhoods and good public transit. \n\n2. Inconveniencing drivers out of spite. We don't want to have some kind of revenge on drivers because we are a bunch of douchebags. Currently we are at a huge disadvantage in an event of a crash and culture is not helping. Some Americans for example will blame you if you GET HIT BY A CAR. That is toxic. Physics is against us, therefore we need every help we can get. Streets will again be safer when there is fewer cars and the remaining ones travel slower. Again, second best step is to have safer, people-centric instead of car-centric infrastructure. \n\n3. To take your means of transportation away. NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE YOUR CAR AWAY. We want to provide other options for those who don't want to drive places, but currently have no other options of getting where they need. If you absolutely need to drive regularly due to large distance or cargo amount, that's OK. If you live in a remote rural area where public transport or infrastructure is not feasible, that is also OK. We don't want to punish or shame you if you need to drive.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n1. We are not a bunch of losers who can't drive. Some of us do have our driver's licence, some also sometimes drive on occasion, when necessary. We are not one-sided, we know what the world looks like from behind the wheel. We know what can be reasonably expected from a driver and what can not. Most of us refrain from driving by choice.\n\n2. You will also benefit from there being fewer cars on the road if you need to drive. Yes, seriously. The only group of drivers who we want to shame or punish are lazy dipshits who drive excessively large, dangerous cars in an unsafe manner while having fuel economy worsening mods.",

      "title": "So You Want To Fuck Cars: Running an org, a practical guide",
      "text": "Hey guys, I\u0019m Beli_Mawrr, Sacramento, CA resident and local purveyor of anti-car fuckery. Sorry it's been so long since the last SYWTFC. I figured I'd make this post for Midweek Meme Moratorium, though it seems we've stopped doing that. \n\nEDIT: Image for the thumbnail: https://i.imgur.com/LwlZxAj.png\n\nAnyway, running an org is probably one of the most significant things you can do for urbanism in your area - voting, while important, rarely has the impact you're looking for. Volunteering, in its various forms, will have far greater impact.\n\n***Why?***\n\nPoliticians in small towns are begging to hear opinions from citizens. With an org, those opinions get amplified and focused. You can do things like campaign for or against politicians. You can organize protests if you swing that way. You can do Tactical Urbanism. Whatever it is, it's more effective as an org than as an individual.\n\n# Starting and running orgs \n\n## Recruiting\n\nfor the org I'm a part of, [Sacramento Valley Advocates for a Sustainable Future](https://svasf.org/) it was as simple as making a post for like-minded urbanists here on r/fuckcars, joining the discord, and then our wonderful leader Adrian took matters into his own hands to create the org more officially. \n\nOrgs like /r/CharlotteUrbanists (Calling u/unroja!) have their own subreddit instead of a website and recruit by posting memes. You might consider a social media presence to be critical for organizing - have members post short videos about their experiences on public transit, funny memes, tictacs or whatever you kids are doing these days, that kind of thing. This lets more interested people hear about your org, and ideally participate. Recruitment is a key part of being an org. I've also heard of people putting up posters and signs, it really depends on who you want to engage - an energized and frustrated youth, or experienced, wiser older people.\n\n## Meetings and organization\n\nthe fact is that if an org isn't doing much, it's not an effective org. This means making decisions and talking as a group. I'm not going to try to tell you that orgs have to all agree on everything - you'll never have that! What's important is that you have a defined method of making decisions, whether it be hierarchical or democratic. I won't dwell much on this other than it's necessary to have it written down somewhere.\n\nThis is where many orgs choose to have a charter. A charter is just a paper that defines a lot of features of your org - how are meetings run? How, if at all, are dues collected (More on that later)? Is participation a requirement? What are your goals? Etc.\n\nThere are some key roles in an org, but the leader's job is most important - motivating other members to do stuff. They should be writing down the results of meetings and critically, **follow up and nag until action items are done!**\n\nOne warning for this section. I've heard of and experienced this method of decision making called \"Consensus\" (or unanimity, meaning all members must agree on a stance before progress can be made) - I can tell you from experience it is a disaster waiting to happen. Dissenting members will be emotionally manipulated, bullied, accused of holding up the group, and eventually kicked out so the status quo \"can\" change. Meetings will last days and the status quo will be the unassailable, godlike fact of your existence and your org won't move forward. Don't use Consensus. Do majority!\n\n## Activities you should do\n\nAs an org you have extra power to change things in your community that you wouldn't have as an individual, in fact that's why you do it! As an org, ideally you should be **going to city council meetings**. Depending on how your org \"Swings\" this is probably the most significant thing you can do as an org. The city council should know your name and, if they act in ways counter to the interests of the people, should dread it! Coordinate your speeches to work with one another's. Have counter-points to the NIMBYs who show up (They will!) \n\nYou should organize \"Outreach campaigns\" be that trying to [lobby or persuade](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/twzxjj/so_you_want_to_fuck_cars_how_to_lobby_local/) your politicians, or trying to convince drivers of the other ways that things can be done. Create voting guides by interviewing candidates. Email campaigns are especially powerful. SVASF successfully did a public records request thanks to a particularly diligent and persuasive member, getting evidence of city misconduct. It was very satisfying to see our own names in the emails we uncovered saying that \"You better be sure of this because we're catching a lot of flak for it!\" \n\nI won't go too deep into tactical urbanism, but it can be a great way to affect direct change on the community. I've had city council members stonewall me until I say \"Look, just say we can and we'll do it ourselves\". Check out r/tacticalurbanism for details - the mod there runs a great (if somewhat small) community. Just be aware if you do things without the city council approval you're \"Vandalizing\" to my great frustration.  \n\n## Legality and accounting\n\n-  this will be for the US only, sorry! -\n\nNow I don't want to go too deep into this because I'm neither an accountant nor a lawyer, but my understanding is that if you want to be certain kinds of organizations, you need to be a part 501 3 c org, which has specific ways of collecting funds, and must be subject to a very annoying and expensive yearly audit, and may not be political, so maybe being a 5013c is probably not the best route. Just be aware that there are laws surrounding how organizations accept donations, how they can be used, and what accounting must be done - it might be (look this up!) better to accept dues instead of donations.\n\nA friend of mine recommends we create \"Hybrid PACs\" Instead of 5013c orgs, and also says \"Do not file as an LLC if you intend to have volunteers. That is illegal\"\n\n## TL;DR:\n\nOrgs help you achieve urbanist goals. Recruiting is important, as is outreach and lobbying. Run your org legally and effectively.\n\nAnyway, I hope that helps you start and run an org! Good luck out there!",

The local grocery store chain has an app that makes it so easy plus it was just $6 to have my groceries delivered and a $7 tip. Usually I ride my bike 2 miles to the store and get a weeks worth of groceries in 2 panniers and a front basket.\n\nWe ordered food for 5 meals plus some stuff to make smoothies. The food arrived in 10 seperate plastic bags. All of our produce was put into individual produce bags also. Like I got 5 bananas,4 bulbs of garlic, 6 onions, 2 zucchini, etc.... all in seperate produce bags. \n\nUsually when I shop I use absolutely zero bags. I even carry reusable mesh produce bags with me for all my veggies. When I check out I just have them put my groceries directly back in my cart. That way I can divide up my groceries some what evenly in my panniers on my bike.\n\nThis isn't sustainable and basically just a good choice for hermits and the disabled. Next week .back on my usual grind.",

      "title": "\"The car is driving us completely crazy\"",
      "text": "&gt;Following is a translated conversation from September 2007 with transport scientist Hermann Knoflacher who even in the hayday of the car saw it's destructive potential and did his best to minimize it. While a bit long it's definitely worth it. He is an OG! \n\n*DIE ZEIT: Do you reject the car?*\n\nHermann Knoflacher: I don't reject the car. But I am aware of what it means for our society.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you drive a car yourself?*\n\nKnoflacher: I don't own one, but I do drive myself from time to time.\n\n*ZEIT: What influence does motorization have on our society?*\n\nKnoflacher: An incredible influence. The car is like a virus that takes root in the brain and totally reverses the code of conduct, value system and perception. A normal person would describe our current living space as totally insane! We retreat more or less voluntarily into sealed houses with soundproof windows to leave the outside space to the noise, dust and exhaust fumes of the cars. That's a complete reversal of values that we don't even notice anymore.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you think this came about?*\n\nKnoflacher: Our problem is the upright gait. We need a relatively large amount of muscle and control energy to stabilize our bodies. Think of the difficulty of movement under the influence of alcohol. In the car, we use only one-sixth of our body energy and have the impression of being insanely fast and strong. That is one component. The other is the requirement for urban planning to accommodate the car in close proximity to all activities. In doing so, one destroys the natural habitat, public transport, local supply and ultimately also the social network that man has built up over thousands of years.\n\n*ZEIT: The car destroys evolution?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, but the human achievements of the last generations have been destroyed by the car.\n\n*ZEIT: Does the age of the car mean our cultural downfall?*\n\nKnoflacher: I wouldn't say that, because in my opinion cultural decline is not really a problem. It is only a very late evolutionary layer that is breaking away. Much worse are the ongoing structural destructions caused by the car.\n\n*ZEIT: Is driving an addiction?*\n\nKnoflacher: Absolutely! The car takes possession of people. After all, the car driver is more different from the human being than any insect.\n\n*ZEIT: What do you mean by that?*\n\nKnoflacher: Insects have in common with humans that they manage mobility with their own bodily energy. Drivers don't have to. And there are no insects that destroy the habitat of their offspring out of convenience or move so fast that they kill themselves in the process.\n\n*ZEIT: How mobile do you think a society should be?*\n\nKnoflacher: Every society must be mobile in order to satisfy its needs. If we could fulfill all our needs locally, we would be plants, not people. Human mobility always arises as a result of a local deficiency.\n\n*ZEIT: Why are we proud of our mobility?*\n\nKnoflacher: You are talking about technical mobility. Historically, we were by no means proud of mobility per se. On the contrary, mobility was always a ballast. Becoming sedentary meant liberation from forced mobility. One was mentally mobile enough to know how to grow plants and domesticate animals.\n\n*ZEIT: Is that why terms like gypsy or tramp are swear words?*\n\nKnoflacher: It's clear: the sedentary have conquered their territory and denied entry to anyone else. Sedentarism works on the principle of exclusivity. The nomads dispute the sedentary people's spatial resources and are hated for it.\n\n*ZEIT: You are a critic of transportation and at the same time a planner. How\ndoes that fit together?*\n\nKnoflacher: At the beginning of my career, I discovered that traditional transportation is based on mere assumptions. For a long time, the consequences for society or ecology were not even considered. No one paid attention to whether noise or exhaust problems would arise, whether people would die, whether the economy would be changed, or whether unemployment would be created. My goal is to put transportation planning on a scientific basis. From this point of view, I consider transportation to be one of the most exciting scientific fields that currently exist.\n\n*ZEIT: You criticize the lack of networking between transport planning and\nother disciplines.*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes. The core theses of transportation are, in my opinion, completely wrong! The idea of mobility growth is based on an incomplete view of the system. It was assumed that mobility would increase as motorization increased. In the meantime, however, we know that only the number of car trips is increasing, but the total number of trips made remains the same, because trips by public transport and walking are decreasing at the same time. The second false assumption is that of saving time by increasing speed. This thesis forms the basis of many economic efficiency calculations in transportation planning. In fact, there is no time saving by higher speeds. Only the distances increase for the same travel time.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you prove something like that?*\n\nKnoflacher: By taking a critical look at the human time budget. Interestingly, the time spent daily on mobility is more or less constant around the globe. However, the distances covered vary. In the 1960s, the philosopher Ivan Illich demonstrated that the amount of energy humans invest in the car and its associated infrastructure would be sufficient to cover the same distance on foot - and in a much nicer and quieter environment. We know that higher speeds don't save any real time!\n\n*ZEIT: But doesn't a society's mobility increase when it covers greater\ndistances?*\n\nKnoflacher: No. Quite the opposite. The additional distance is pointless. Man covers the greater distances to satisfy the same needs as before. He does the same thing as before, only he travels farther to do it.\n\n*ZEIT: But we are expanding our horizons.*\n\nKnoflacher: How is the horizon supposed to expand if I speed past my surroundings at 100 kilometers per hour? You narrow your horizon extremely because of the fast movement!\n\n*ZEIT: You perceive different things when you go on vacation to India instead\nof Bavaria.*\n\nKnoflacher: It doesn't depend on where you go, but what you discover there. You don't experience more on a well-trodden tourist path in India than in Bavaria. On the contrary, with vigilance and curiosity, you can discover things in Bavaria that you won't find in India. Speeds, which exceed our evolutionary grown possibilities, also exceed our perception. We are not mentally able to cope with the distances that we have made technically possible.\n\n*ZEIT: But we feel powerful.*\n\nKnoflacher: Of course. Mobility always means power. Studies show, by the way, that parents do not consider their own children when they have to choose between a parking space in front of their front door and a traffic-calmed zone. The restriction of movement, even the danger of death for their own offspring, is consciously accepted when it comes to finding the closest possible parking space.\n\n*ZEIT: Is driving a car completely crazy?*\n\nKnoflacher: Considering the conditions that man has created for himself for his car, driving a car is clearly the most pleasant form of mobility and therefore quite rational. In comparison, just look at the movement infrastructure of pedestrians. Sidewalks in their current form are a joke! In the past, pedestrians were allowed to occupy the entire street surface - for 7000 years! Over the last 50 years we have marginalized the pedestrian and wonder why this form of mobility is disappearing. We have built structures that force people to drive!\n\n*ZEIT: Are we living in a dictatorship of car drivers?*\n\nKnoflacher: Absolutely!\n\n*ZEIT: Can this be changed?*\n\nKnoflacher: Of course. It would be enough to change the organization of parking spaces. If, on your way to park your car, you pass a public transport stop or a store - which would automatically locate itself - the need to drive would decrease. These days, you torture people with symptom heresy. You collect a little parking fee here, a little toll there. That's totally unfair. First you build structures that encourage people to use their cars, and then you charge them. As a planner, you have to create transportation structures that free people from the compulsion to drive!\n\n*ZEIT: That sounds like a job full of conflict.*\n\nKnoflacher: At the time, people predicted that my idea of making Kärntnerstrasse in Vienna a pedestrian zone would mean its economic death. Later, I was told that cycling was completely unattractive to the Viennese and that speeding up public transport by paving stops would cause an uprising among car drivers. Supposedly, everything was unpopular. Yet the Viennese embraced these ideas, and the city's quality of life has risen in international rankings. You can't always just satisfy voters' wishes. After all, you don't give tax-free drugs to drug addicts, although this wish would certainly exist.\n\n*ZEIT: In your opinion, can the problem be solved through the price of\ngasoline?*\n\nKnoflacher: No! Any increase in the price of gasoline is a purely symptomatic treatment and automatically leads into the social trap. If only the rich can afford gasoline and the poor can't, the traffic problem remains unsolved, and a social injustice is added. You have to start with the parking space and the way to get there. If parking space is organized properly, car-free areas with a high quality of life will be created. Those who want to sleep peacefully will just have to walk further to the car. And those who prefer the car have to live where it is noisy and smelly. Car parking spaces must be organized in the same way as public transport stops.\n\n*ZEIT: You advocate more parking bans?*\n\nKnoflacher: There you see how car-indoctrinated you think. If pedestrians are forbidden to cross a street where they want to, that is quite normal. A reorganization of traffic zones into pedestrian and car areas is demonized as a ban on cars, without thinking about the fact that this separation offers the best solution.\n\n*ZEIT: What about the much-vaunted freedom of the motorist?*\n\nKnoflacher: That is a purely virtual freedom that is sold via advertising. An empty country road is shown in beautiful surroundings, with a single car speeding around. If the reality of traffic with traffic jams were shown, no one would be stupid enough to buy a car.\n\n*ZEIT: Cars still sell very well.*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes, because car drivers also enjoy another kind of freedom, a legal freedom. Unlike everyone else, they are allowed to make noise and pollute the environment and endanger public safety with impunity. A rampaging drunk will be arrested for noise pollution, motorists who blast our homes at all hours of the day and night will be accepted. If I were to spray carcinogenic substances as a pedestrian with a can, it would be against the law. Thousands of car drivers do this every day without hindrance and shorten the lifespan of all of us by an average of twelve years.\n\n*ZEIT: The car driver is a killer?*\n\nKnoflacher: Yes, but not out of malicious intent. The car puts us into a space-time structure of irresponsibility that we can neither comprehend nor cope with. And it has a strong lobby: The car industry, the construction industry, even the banks that grant loans for car purchases, take great care to ensure that studies like the one just mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) are not published.\n\n\n*ZEIT: Even teenagers dream of cars.*\n\nKnoflacher: Because they have experienced years of lack of freedom by riding in them. A child's mobility is radically restricted by the car. They are not allowed to walk to or across the street, they are not allowed to play everywhere, they are locked into the narrow rear of a car for hours on end, and they are also strapped in. Clearly, teens can't wait to regain their freedom with a driver's license and a car of their own.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you think cars cause wars?*\n\nKnoflacher: One hundred percent! And you don't even have to look at Iraq. Here, too, there is a permanent war. In Austria, two people are killed on the road every day. Traffic causes physical damage to 40,000 people every year. And that doesn't even include those who die as a result of exhaust fumes, according to the WHO.\n\n*ZEIT: How do you feel when you drive past suburban shopping centers,\nfurniture markets and similar facilities?*\n\nKnoflacher: They are parasites! I feel sorry for any city with such structures. After all, the traffic problem is, among other things, a child of such shopping centers and furniture stores on the outskirts of the city. The main problem is the huge free parking spaces. They should be taxed so heavily that parking there costs the same as in the city center. Everyone should be allowed to build where they want, but it can't be right that business people in the city centers have to struggle with parking fees while everything is provided for free on the outskirts.\n\n*ZEIT: Do you think that in ten years Europe's cities will look like the much\nderided U.S. cities with their extensive suburban single-family zones, huge\nshopping centers and few public transportation options?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, because reurbanization is currently taking place in many cities in Europe. This also has to do with the aging of the population. Old people can't get the service on the outskirts of the city that they get in the center. They simply have to return to the city. Apart from that, the energy issue will force people to move back to the cities.\n\n*ZEIT: You mean the price of gasoline?*\n\nKnoflacher: No, I mean the price of energy in general. This will certainly increase and have a decisive impact on all areas of life. This applies to heating, power supply, transportation - and all of this has a much greater impact in terms of insulation in a single-family home on the outskirts of town than in the city center. And older people need many energy-intensive services that become very expensive when prices rise. I'm not just thinking of \"meals on wheels\" or similar services. The more sprawled people live, the more energy is required. And we will soon no longer be able to afford that. That means we have to create sustainable urban structures now in order to be able to finance the future. Because the current cities with their marginal settlements are definitely not that.\n\n*ZEIT: Is it true that the social costs of mobilization are higher than the\nprofits, which include jobs in the automotive industry?*\n\nKnoflacher: That is absolutely true. And the bill will get even worse for consumers, because at the moment mobility is more or less free, and that will soon change dramatically.\n\n*ZEIT: Why are air travelers now suddenly being criticized in relation to\nmobility and climate protection, and not car drivers?*\n\nKnoflacher: First of all, the harmful effects of air travel are not insignificant and the criticism is justified. This is also due to the fact that low-cost airlines activate passenger groups that would otherwise not be found in air travel. Basically, flying is the most degrading form of transportation of all. Flying always reminds me of factory farming: chickens in a laying battery being fed off. Unlike the people on the plane, at least the chickens are not strapped in.\n\n&gt; Professor Hermann Knoflacher has been teaching at the Institute of Transport Planning and Traffic Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology for more than 30 years. The 67-year-old became known for his concepts for Vienna. He developed pedestrian zones, put streetcars on tracks and proposed a network of cycle paths.\n\nThanks to /u/Alexander_Selkirk for posting it to /r/fahrrad and DeepL for translating.",

      "text": "Dear [Recipient],\n\nI am writing to you today to express my strong support for the implementation of bicycle lanes in our city instead of further investment in car infrastructure.\n\nAs you are aware, the transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and our city must take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint. Building more car infrastructure would only perpetuate our reliance on fossil fuels and further exacerbate our already critical climate crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, investing in bicycle lanes would not only reduce our carbon footprint, but also provide numerous other benefits. Bicycle lanes promote physical activity, leading to better public health outcomes, and can also help reduce congestion on our already overcrowded roads. Additionally, bicycle lanes can contribute to a more vibrant and active city life, creating safer and more accessible spaces for all community members.\n\nFurthermore, bicycle infrastructure is often more cost-effective than car infrastructure. Building bicycle lanes requires less space and resources, leading to lower costs for taxpayers. Additionally, studies have shown that cities with strong bicycle infrastructure have seen significant economic benefits, including increased property values and higher retail sales.\n\nIt is my hope that you will consider these factors when making decisions about transportation infrastructure in our city. I urge you to support the implementation of bicycle lanes in our city as a sustainable, cost-effective, and equitable transportation solution.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. \n\nSincerely,\n[Name]",

      "title": "Housing needs to come before transportation",
      "text": "I think something that isn't talked about enough in this sub is that most people in North America use cars not because they want to but because they need to. And that in order to solve the former we need to solve the latter. \n\nMost NA cities are planned around low-density housing and there are strict zoning laws that keep it this way. NIMBYs (both on the political right and left) oppose any new housing developments especially those with high density living. This has caused a terrible housing crisis in both Canada and the US. Housing costs both to rent and to purchase have skyrocketed and the amount of people who are homeless and underhoused has reached critical levels. \n\nDense housing is the key to creating a sustainable car-reduced/car-free world. Housing is the key to making transit networks viable. Transit without densitification has very little use (look at Long Island) and is a subsidy to the rich. \n\nWe can no longer allow conservative NIMBYs to use bigotry, \"property values\", fear of change to stop us from building. We can no longer allow left NIMBYs to concern troll over gentrification, the environment or \"developer profits\" to stop new housing. \n\nWe cannot allow more gas lighting from people who claim there is no housing shortage, who want to blame everything on greedy corporations buying up all the housing stock or who because of ideological reasons deny the realities of supply and demand. We can no longer entertain people who decry \"luxury\" housing. We can no longer entertain people that want to overthrow capitalism before a single person gets housed. These ideas are all wrong and counterproductive to building more housing. \n\nWe need to fix our housing crisis and actually house people. Everyday someone needs sleeps on the street or a friends couch because they cannot afford a home is a tragedy.\n\nBuild dense housing and the car-free/car-reduced walkable utopia you seek will follow.\n\n**Please join the YIMBY movement and go advocate for more housing in your city.**",

      "title": "Rant: why I often feel frustrated about North American urbanists.",
      "text": "I needed to let off some steam earlier so I wrote the following post earlier today; I intended to post it much earlier but it probably needed some revision anyways. So here is my pitch: if I could ask one question to all North American urbanists and people in NA who follow city planning, it'd be just four words. \"Where is your rage?\" If I was allowed to ramble for a longer period than that, it'd probably be this post. I'm sorry for the rant.\n\nSo the question is this: where is the rage for a city being torn apart by massive roads and highways that pollute it to nobody's business? Where is the rage for a city still building historically classist and systematically racist developments to this day? Where is the rage when homeless people must live between poorly maintained railroad tracks and a golf course for the wealthy?\n\nSacramento. That's the name of a city that's brought me far too much stress recently. Sacramento's done this to no end and aims to continue doing this. The city destroyed its Japantown to build a park just for the Capitol Building. It carved through and separated its oldest part of town with a massive interstate highway. It gutted its once-robust streetcar system for three LRT lines that really don't quite cut it.\n\nThese actions were often done to appeal to the car and with the wealthy in mind.\n\nToday, it aims to widen I-80, I-5, US-50, and CA-99... so you know... pretty much every fully-separated highway it has authority over. It's building new isolated single-family developments far from anything else, as are all its satellite cities and suburbs. It's torn out large swaths of natural space in the name of \"flood control\" (which they've failed at many times before, and residents have said has worsened since). And nearly everything that exists outside about a half square mile city center just... looks like this:\n\n[El Camino Avenue @ Yorktown Avenue looking east via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/7hyv1fxehe5d1.png?width=1409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2cbcfe05e3eecf5b1abc7ec0f05a5fcdc44724)\n\nTo be quite frank, I'm exhausted with this place. It is lost in the 1960s with no plan to exit this hellscape that it has created. It plans on widening those highways because it indeed expects to build even more places like this - places where you have to drive just to go literally anywhere because walking is impossibly slow, difficult, and dangerous.\n\nAs you can see, I'm an obnoxious winge-fest about this place because I have to live near it all. I've only just become an adult and I've got no job - here's to hoping - so I'm landed here for the foreseeable future. This is the view I see of the city.\n\n=\n\nI think people don't like negativity. This makes sense, because avoiding constant negativity and hate and anger is healthy, and people who are always negative are also often very miserable. Additionally, I firmly believe that positivity towards positive actions done by cities is a vital aspect to urbanists' advocacy. When a city does something that will improve its quality of life, sustainability, and health, that should absolutely be applauded. I also know that small things matter and that small steps are required to get on the right track. And on top of that, I get that perspective changes how you view a place.\n\nI've been told that I should be grateful for living in Sacramento. After all, I have a roof over my head. I don't have to cycle 10 miles down winding midwest country roads with not even a painted bike gutter to get to the nearest grocery store. And while that is a valid perspective and I am glad for the little things about where I am vs where I could be, it's extremely hard for me to personally digest this response. I should be grateful for... this??\n\n[Yorktown Avenue @ El Camino Avenue, looking west down El Camino via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/wdsihfwajg5d1.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c23fe583cf7a5cbda4be53f68c8fc7783ec8579)\n\nWhen people's reactions to my complaints about a place like this is to say \"be grateful, cause it could be worse,\" that just shows how utterly dystopian this part of the world is. It not only doesn't console me but it makes me even more upset knowing that *THIS* is one of the better parts of the continent.\n\nYes, I would rather be here than biking next to racist pro-lifers in lifted F-150s trying to rolling-coal me. I know it's a relative privilege to be able to live in a city that has *some modicum* of safety outside a car. But why is it I feel these folks are telling me I should be *happy* to live in a place like this? That modicum of safety is TINY and  while Sacramento's nowhere near the worst it's still a miserable place people clearly don't care about and just hope to get out of as soon as they can.\n\nIs it a privilege to live in a fairly regular North American car pit?\n\nIt's perspective that leads people to these takes, I know. Some folks are truly roughing it somewhere where they can't even afford a car and have to walk through dumps like this. But that's such a dystopian take. \"Hey buddy, it only goes down from here,\" it says. \"Those are the shining lights. Lovely, ain't they?\"\n\n=\n\nIn my opinion, the positive aspects of a place get disproportionately more positive attention than the negative aspects get negative attention. Sacramento's a great example of this. Downtown is absolutely beautiful. Like. It's called the city of trees for a reason.\n\n[K Street @ 9th looking west via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/9wku9otphe5d1.png?width=1406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233c5c7d21102c77da9541437677f1dd1638bd4e)\n\nLook, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being happy about this place. I'm happy about it. I want to see more of it and I want people to show their approval for places like this. It's just that at least from my perspective it often feels like North American city planning followers will point to places like this and give them showering Urbanist Gold Credits for Doing The Good Street Thing. And again, I want to emphasize that we *should* amp up places like this because these are the type of places we want every place to build.\n\nBut that comes with the caveat that we also do need to remember that this is the little half square mile. Like so many other cities in North America, there's this little world almost separate from the rest where it's actually really nice with lovely old streets and great transit. But that's the key, it's almost a separate world.\n\nIn Sacramento, it's not immediate suburban sprawl hell the moment you step out of that little plot, but it is a place choked by highways and that place quickly deteriorates in quality the further out you go. Additionally, the price of living in downtown Sacramento - while inconsistent and volatile - is pretty hard to justify. People can easily be paying $4k for a *studio*, or almost worse be paying something relatively reasonable but end up in an apartment that has few or no amenities and is practically preparing to fall apart next time an earthquake hits. People shouldn't be stuck somewhere miserable or stung for something just livable.\n\nAnd the areas outside downtown are just. 1960s American suburban art, in the derogatory sense. If anyone's still reading this, have you watched the movie adaptation of *A Wrinkle in Time*? Bit of a spoiler but there's a scene where everything's been tailor-made to be identical to everything else, including people and their schedules, and it's a stereotypical American cul-de-sac suburb, and it's *creepy*. Yeah, tell that to Sacramento and its suburbs and they'll take it to the next level by not only making it real but making it even more devoid of life.\n\n[Auburn Boulevard west of Sylvan Road, looking west via Google Maps](https://preview.redd.it/bs3kb9fuhe5d1.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7dd7e809d5a97acbd60fef75d5281d1390e9a2)\n\nSo yes, the downtown's beautiful, but can you really still say Sacramento's all that good if most of it looks like this, and this is how most Sacramento residents actually experience the city?\n\nWhen I'm told I should be grateful for where I live, this is the lens through which I see it. I almost never get to see downtown. So to be honest, I can't help but look through my lens and say, no, I'm sorry, this is fucking miserable. Frankly, the thing I'm most grateful for is that I know a few things about city planning and can identify that these issues exist.\n\n=\n\nSo why don't I just move out?\n\nWell, let's think of some cities known for their great urbanism in North America.\n\nVancouver! Vancouver's pretty great, it's beautiful, it's in Canada so free healthcare - oh my, the median rent's *$2,950* per month.\n\nToronto! Toronto's not quite in the northeast, but it is close and that area's known for its urbanism and great city pla- $2,650 per month.\n\nSo Canada's a bit of a no-go... how about New York City? I hear it's hands down the best city in North America. Oh wait, that's right, the rent's infamous for being like $10,000 for a tiny little box.\n\nAnd that's the main issue. There are some places with incredible urbanism but to be brutally honest, they're still so fucking unlivable due to the cost of rent alone. I mean, it's San Francisco everywhere!\n\nRemember also that I have no money of my own, so it's not like I can just book a one-way to Chicago.\n\nLet me be a bit aggressive for a moment. \"Just move out\" is one of the laziest, most privilege-lensed, fucked up responses possible.\n\nSo, I should advocate, then, right? But with what platform? Nobody's gonna listen to this random singular person who whines about stroads. And it's also a time and energy investment that brings you right into the heart of the firey pits of American politics. Look, I'm just one person and while I'm sure they're there I've never met anyone else who is as open about the city's planning nightmare. Hell, how long's CAHSR taking even with advocates in favor?\n\nOne of my biggest frustrations is that I always feel like I have absolutely no power in this country. My voice is unheard by everyone but a little group of friends. Honestly, for me, it'd almost be easier to move out, because as far as the government in charge is concerned, I simply don't exist. Telling me to \"just advocate\" completely misses that advocacy only works if people are willing to listen, and frankly, nobody who can do anything about it is.\n\n=\n\nLet me talk for a minute about \"the northeast and Chicago problem\". What's this? Well, it's when North American urbanists champion the same small set of cities that happen to have a pretty significant positive background with city planning already. NYC, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, the Twin Cities.\n\nLook, these cities are wonderful, but most of them are in the wealthiest subset of North America where a massive portion of the continent's economic wealth is concentrated. I get the vibe that people think these places are representative of the whole country. They aren't. The suburbs of Sacramento are a way more accurate depiction of what it's like to live in the United States or Canada. And so I continue feeling my anger towards them.\n\nLook, there's an entire section of interstate that totally flouts the interstate regulations because a town in Pennsylvania didn't want their car tourism to dip. This story of \"please don't remove the cars, we'll lose our tourism\" is almost (not quite, but almost) exclusively North American. The places worse than Sacramento only make me even angrier, because the way the people in power have configured them has created a nightmarish dystopia machine.\n\nI like Chicago and I respect the northeast because these places are truly the royalty of North American city planning for a lot of people and a lot of reasons. But they only represent a tiny bit of the region and most people don't have the privilege of living in these places. Yes, the whole NJB \"give up on America\" thing very clearly came from a place of privilege and was kinda nuts, but the whole \"just move to Philly\" thing is almost on the same tier and I'm just so tired of it.\n\nThe worst part? There are just so many things about even Chicago and NYC that scream \"gutted for the car\" or some other issue like financial deficit or historical racism. An entire black neighborhood was bulldozed to put Central Park in NYC and the city barely even acknowledges it. What about the BQE? That tore New York's neighborhood apart and the city still pays for it dearly.\n\n[Hudson River Greenway by the World Trade Center, NYC, looking south.](https://preview.redd.it/jx89kz34qg5d1.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=107e0b9f74d319e9a027976f6eb9f395a6c2b6f6)\n\nA lot of even New York City is still absolutely bleeding for the mistakes made for the car. Congestion, massive stroads through the urban core, highways cutting off every waterfront. And this is *NEW YORK CITY.*\n\nThere's a lot to love about a lot of places in North America. A lot of places have something that is genuinely very charming about them. I personally love the neighborhood of Fremont in Seattle for its unapologetic weirdness - they even have a statue of Lenin that someone mortgaged their house to bring to Seattle. I can also see the charm in New Orleans's historic cultural prowess and lovely canals that crisscross some of the city. And Sacramento has its lovely street trees. There is lots of charm to be found in even the most roughed-up places.\n\nHowever, that just makes it so much sadder that these places have been almost *buried* in cars. I just can't help but see so much waste, shattered potential, and destroyed city fabric in these places. Why are we still gladly erasing the charm of a bizarrely imported statue or a culture scene so big they name things after and make art all about the city that created it with flavorless stroads with no sidewalks and Camazotzian dystopia cul-de-sacs? Where is the rage for the people whose houses get bulldozed to cram another lane in?\n\n[Looking west down New Orleans's Madrid Street, between Arts and Music Streets, via Google Maps.](https://preview.redd.it/0f924cbjrg5d1.png?width=1383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7436ce2da9dbc4a1af9f32a0fa22f2e7fd9e65ff)\n\n=\n\nI want to see positivity. But I also want to see what places are actually like, and to be honest, even in places known for something truly charming and powerful, the place that once may have been isn't there anymore. I personally think that just because there's something that is generally appealing about a place, doesn't mean it's a good place.\n\nJust because Sacramento has a nice downtown does not mean I should hold back my thoughts about the new single-family exurbs going up left and right.\n\nJust because New Orleans is historic, doesn't mean I'm going to see the appeal given a lens into what the city's actually like.\n\nIf a city is underrated and financially struggling, it's more fuel on the fire against car infrastructure. When Sacramento pours billions into highway widening projects, they're pouring that financial investment down the drain. These decisions are made at best carelessly and at worst still with the intent to make the rich richer, and I will continue to be upset at places like Sacramento for said decisions.\n\n=\n\nAll people deserve better.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to bike 10 miles without any protection to get to a store. People shouldn't have to rely on depreciating assets to get anything done in their lives. People should be able to enjoy a beautiful urban core without having to return home to a rundown apartment next to a highway and a stroad. People deserve to be able to afford mixed-use developments. People deserve not to be kicked out of a place they may already be struggling to pay for just so a polluting, wasteful highway can be blasted right on through their home. People deserve not to suffer for the continued systemic racism and classism of the current, outdated city planning standards still followed by a wide majority of North America.\n\nThis way of doing things is wrong.\n\nSo, I will ask just once more. North America: where is your rage?\n\n=\n\nThank you if you're still tolerating my whining and rambling. I hope you can understand my frustration and perspective. I want to make really clear that I know North America isn't totally silent about this. There are lots of small towns and great groups working to improve on the mistakes that haunt us from the 1960s. But I get very jaded and frustrated so often and I just needed to let this out or I'd itch for eternity. Please feel free to tell of your perspective because perspective matters. And remember: we all want the same thing. We want the domination of the car to end.\n\nThis is not my main account -- I will be watching on this post as u/thatsalice. \n\n(EDIT JUN 12: okay so replying is locked due to low karma too, not just main posting. oh well, i'll just address what i wanted to here: \n\ndear \"just move out\" replies in this thread: lol, lmao. thanks for demonstrating the problem :3 )\n\nThanks for your time!",

      "title": "Noise Pollution Hurting Health - Solutions",
      "text": "*I wanted to write a post on a serious issue that's been affecting my health and quality of life and see what can be done to stop this car related issue. I feel that listing as much as I know, acknowledging the problem, and posting it here could help do something more. Apologies in advance for the length:*\n\nSince the pandemic took effect, **extreme noise pollution** from modified mufflers and car subwoofers, which can be heard blocks away, have been affecting our ability to live altogether. It is constant. Literally at every stop light, at every hour, regardless of holiday or season. You can argue that living on a main street in Chicago has drawbacks, or that there is always that one loud car that drives around during the Summer, but this is not that. Our walls and floors are vibrating constantly from the ultrasonic waves emitted by these souped-up cars, and there are literally hundreds of them post-lockdown, which are going un-ticketed and unwarned. No amount of sound-proofing stops something you can hear blocks away. I do not have noise sensitivity, nor have I ever complained about such a thing until this started in 2021, and we've lived at the same residence on a major street for decades.\n\nPersonally, this has been a nightmare. We've undergone several deaths in our family, and we cannot even have the peace necessary to mourn those losses, because that is how loud and pervasive these disturbances are. Little thought goes by that is unrelated to this issue. There is now no difference between our house and the street. And this has sustained itself for 2 years. I now have tinnitus (ear ringing), and heart palpitations, as a result. The disturbances are loud enough to create momentary panic, and constantly enough, it causes hypertension and heart problems, and a change in the brain's chemistry. It feels as though you have lost your home.\n\nI've gone through every proactive process I can think of to stop it: speaking to police at 'CAPS' program beat meetings, speaking to our alderman, contacting neighborhood associations for help, even making a door to door petition. (Requesting a noise sensitive zone to be made: for signs to be posted warning these drivers of the fines already in Chicago law). I even contacted the EPA and wrote to the US secretary of transportation, inquiring about very simplistic processes that could be put in place to curb this problem.\n\n**What I have learned:**\n\n\t***Lockdown during the pandemic*** enabled many of these drivers, all over the country, the time and funds to modify their vehicles to this extreme. The pandemic fueled impatience, fear, volatility, immaturity, and the decline for many processes and standards that have not resolved, and this issue is the result of it.\n\n\t***Effects on the car industry*** enabled many car manufacturers to produce and market illegally louder and more aggressive vehicles. Manufacturers underwent heavy demand that couldn't be met during the pandemic, resulting in the further sales of alternate vehicles and the push for them. Marketing teams, to stimulate the car market, willingly created this public health problem for a profit. Companies such as Dodge and Ford have been manufacturing towering Pickup trucks that are literally as loud as semi-truck engines, mustangs and chargers that shake the ground while idling, all to draw attention from buyers. More and more vehicles are being created by stock to be louder, and it has even been speculated that acoustic engineers have been employed by some manufacturers to artificially amplify, through the cars stereo system, fake engine noises. You can occasionally see an older, unmodified sports car or motorcycle on the road that is nowhere near as loud. New advertisements have accentuated aggressive driving with amplified engine sounds in their media campaigns to push this agenda, which in turn has helped to enable a huge wave of dangerous driving under these conditions.\n\n\t***Law enforcement*** has become de-incentivized from performing traffic stops or virtually any traffic enforcement on city streets or highways in many states. Speaking personally to police sergeants, they have said that the volatility is higher, and the risks are greater for violent altercations, for when they do a traffic stop, and that they are discouraged from creating a negative encounter with a driver,  if it is not perceived as absolutely necessary, which leads to this excessive result. Non-pursuit policies are even in place for vehicles that do not pull over. Officers have also attested that they are extremely short staffed, as over 1000 officers had either been fired or retired since the pandemic began in Chicago. Remaining officers are told to prioritize calls by level of severity, and they are not likely to re-engage or check on past calls after they have departed the scene. Further, the tactic of a visual presence, which is used to encourage drivers to \"self-police\", under fear of being ticketed, is no longer being utilized as a strategy. And officers are not responding to these types of disturbances, unless called directly. But of course, the excuse stands, that once they do respond, the violator is already gone. They further entice that you record the violating vehicles plate number, and report them. But safely? Without being noticed? And hundreds of vehicles? OEMC has stated that officers will not be sent out to stand by and wait for a vehicle to commit an offense, despite the fact that this issue is so constant, it would take minutes to locate a car in violation. Officers also use the excuse that they will need decibel meters, which is false, in accordance with Chicago law, which states that any noise disturbance from a vehicle, plainly audible by an officer from a 100 foot distance, is viable for a $300 fine upon first offense, to be followed with $500, and then $1000 or impoundment. And, this fine was increased in 2022, through the efforts of several alderman, to $5000 for motorcycles bearing illegal mufflers. But without law enforcement, the laws are pointless.\n\n**This has become nationwide Post-Pandemic:**\n\nThis activity is linked directly to the uptick in dangerous driving that I am sure many people have noticed post-pandemic. I have been to 7 states in urban, suburban, and rural settings since this started, and it is now pervasive in all of them (CO, NY, PA, OH, IN, IL, WI). When compared to the previous year, traffic fatalities nationwide jumped by 7 percent in 2020 and 10.5 percent in 2021, hitting a 20-year high. There have even been multiple news segments about the drag racing and drifting events that would take over downtown areas with little enforcement to stop them. In 2021 convoys of hundreds of modified motorcycles invaded downtown NYC &amp; Chicago, running up on the sidewalks and even hitting a pedestrian, many without any license plates, and none were ever pulled over or stopped, but simply tailed by police until they dispersed on their own accord, miles away. (NY state even passed the SLEEP Act as a result of this issue in 2022, trying to regulate the sale of illegal mufflers and car audio equipment. NJ passed similar legislation, watered down however. NYC even instituted paying the public $100 rewards for tips leading to the impoundment and destruction of illegal motorcycles. Connecticut State Government passed a bill regarding illegal mufflers being tested during regular vehicle emission testing sites in 2022. NYC, Miami, Knoxville, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and many other cities have had news articles and passed stricter laws within the last 2 years. Though many of these efforts are in their infancy)\n\n***Solutions***:\n\n**Emissions Testing to Include Decibel Level Testing**\n\nA significant solution, is to institute decibel testing at Emissions Testing Centers. This would be a more immediate and simplistic course of action, in place of lacking law enforcement. These measures would include briefly searching for amplified audio equipment within a vehicle, while also measuring the noise emitted by a car's muffler through a decibel reader. This measure is simplistic and will save the health of thousands, while preemptively screening for and mandating the removal of these illegal audio systems and mufflers designed to disrupt others and civil order.\n\n**Funding O.N.A.C. for the E.P.A. / Developing further guidelines**\n\nReestablishing the Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The reestablishment of ONAC, a sector of the Environmental Protection Agency dissolved by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, would be the most concrete course of action. This branch was set to regulate noise pollution through air pollution. From what I've personally been told by the EPA, there hasn't been legislation on noise pollution since the 1970's, which was emphatic of airports alone, and that hadn't branched out far at all into controlling the complex reach of this issue. And now it is severe enough on a traffic level, post-pandemic, to where it should be considered.\n\n**Regulations On Sales of Illegal Car Parts and Audio Equipment**\n\nThese car parts that are used to augment vehicles are legal to sell, but illegal to install and use in this capacity. Major retailers such as Sam's Club and Walmart, sell subwoofers for cars to the general public for as low as $40. The nature of these parts alone are intended to be disruptive and their use is illegal in many states and cities, but the ownership is not. There is no other reason for these specific mufflers and subwoofers to exist other than to amplify noise that extends beyond an acceptable or conversational level. Laws on a state or federal level that regulate or prohibit the promotions and sales of these specific modifications by car manufacturers and auto shops to private individuals would help to end the expansion of this problem. It makes little sense that what is widely disruptive and illegal to use, is still permissible to market and sell.\n\n**Funding and promoting the availability of Noise Ticketing Cameras:**\n\n*The most likely solution*: development of Sound Ticketing Cameras has already been employed and used successfully by NYC, and is in the trial phase of being used in Washinton DC, Miami, and Knoxville, among other cities. This was through a special project by the NYC DEP. Many major cities and states have little awareness of these tools and some elect not to use them due to expense or a perception that the matter is not worth pursuing. But the development of these cameras is necessary in that they replace the need for police traffic stops, while protecting the community from dangerous driving, and insane quality of life and health issues. The cameras operate by issuing a ticket, the same as a speed camera, and a letter is sent to the offender requiring that they either pay a fine or come to a location determined by the EPA branch of the locality to have their equipment tested and removed in place of a fine. NYC has already recorded 70+ successful instances of this and has moved from a trial phase to using multiple cameras which are moveable. The drivers were instructed to visit the site of a sewage treatment plant for the testing. However these cameras are privatized and costly, at $36,000 each. Yet, they are all transportable units that can be switched around to different intersections to spread their efficacy. Several sound camera companies exist, but many cities are using one instituted in the UK, called SoundVue (Formerly Intelligent Instruments) as a direct result of noise levels rising after the pandemic. I've spoken directly to the founder of the company on this issue. City and statewide use or even knowledge of this vital tools are growing, but many are still unaware. Chicago for example, is either unaware or not yet enticed to use this technology, and it is a fight just to be heard on issues such as this, especially with the excuse that there are more pressing crimes and the ignorance that these lower crimes don't foster an environment for worse ones to take place. Something like this would help thousands, procure substantive revenue for local communities, and protect the lives of people who undergo traffic stops. No one likes the idea of traffic cameras, nor do I, but when you've lost your peace, your enjoyment of the little parts of life itself, and can find no place to avoid such a problem, you may come to similar thoughts too.\n\nI feel like the only way to stop this is if enough people collectively complain to an official while providing solutions, substantiating the issue and its impact.  I tried to do that with signatures, I gave up with the follow through, fearing it would make my health worse, and feeling hopeless that I alone could do anything. And yet my health is still degrading. There are people in power who are sympathetic and resourceful enough to consider these things, but its a hard search to find them in your area. A huge problem I have noticed is that many people who are bothered (Any normal person) give up on this, move away, or learn to eat it, and many more people who live on small side streets get enough reprieve to where they can easily ignore this new problem. Without this sole problem, I can't begin to tell you how different my life would be.",

      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

      "text": "Link: https://www.wired.com/story/car-free-cities-opposition/\n\nSample:\n\n&gt;And any attempts to reduce urban car use tend to do better when designed from the bottom up. Barcelona\u0019s \u001csuperblocks\u001d programme, which takes sets of nine blocks within its grid system and limits cars to the roads around the outside of the set (as well as reducing speed limits and removing on-street parking) was shaped by having resident input on every stage of the process, from design to implementation. Early indicators suggest the policy has been wildly popular with residents, has seen nitrogen dioxide air pollution fall by 25 percent in some areas, and will prevent an estimated 667 premature deaths each year, saving an estimated 1.7 billion euros.\n\n&gt;When it comes to design, there\u0019s also the question of access. Whether it\u0019s emergency services needing to get in or small businesses awaiting deliveries, there\u0019s an important amount of \u001clast mile\u001d traffic\u0014transport that gets people or things to the actual end point of their journey\u0014that is vital to sustaining an urban area. If you want to reduce traffic, you have to work around that and think of alternative solutions\u0014such as allowing emergency vehicles access to pedestrianized areas, or even using automatic number plate recognition to exempt emergency vehicles from the camera checks that are used to police through-traffic in LTNs (which is what Lambeth is doing, Holland says).\n\n&gt;But even then, it\u0019s often just hard to convince people an entirely different city layout is possible. Getting people to accept that how they live alongside cars can be changed\u0014say, with an LTN\u0014takes time. But government surveys of the UK\u0019s recently implemented LTNs have indicated that support from residents for such schemes increases over time. \u001cIf you start seeing more and more of those kinds of things, things become thinkable,\u001d explains Aldred. If you start unpicking the idea that car use can\u0019t be changed, \u001cit starts to become possible to do more and more things without cars for people.\u001d\n\n&gt;The other issue is that, to put it simply, cars are never just cars. They\u0019re interwoven into our culture and consumption as symbols of affluence, independence, and success, and the aspiration to achieve those things in future. \u001cA man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure,\u001d the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher reportedly once said. \u001cThat\u0019s how we got in this mess in the first place, though,\u001d says Crawford. \u001cEverybody saw that the rich people were driving cars, and they wanted to too.\u001d",

Nobody really knows.\u001d The former US president added that rising sea levels, caused by melting glaciers, would have the benefit of creating \u001cmore oceanfront property\u001d.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk, meanwhile, said it was wrong to \u001cvilify\u001d the oil and gas industry, the key driver of planet-heating pollution, and that the only imperative to ditch fossil fuels was that they will one day run dry.\n\n&gt;\u001cIf we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,\u001d said Musk, who is also chief executive of the electric car company Tesla. \u001cWe do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;\u001cWe still have quite a bit of time & we don\u0019t need to rush and we don\u0019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that. Like, leave the farmers alone.\u001d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk said the main danger of allowing carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere was that at some point it will become difficult to breathe, causing \u001cheadaches and nausea\u001d to people. This would occur with CO2 at about 1,000 parts per million of the Earth\u0019s atmosphere, more than double the current record-breaking concentrations.\n\nTo be clear, this is a problem soon because we're talking about indoor air which needs to be replaced with outdoor air. The higher outdoor CO2 concentration makes that process more difficult. We don't have to wait until the atmospheric levels are 1000 ppm https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000237 \n\nI think this pretty much confirms what we've been saying for years:  electric cars are here to save the car industry, not the planet. \n\n",

      "text": "With the hours of doom scrolling reddit posts on urban planning, suburbs, urban sprawl and public transit one detail sticks out to me; virtually all Americans are conservative on the topic of public transit. \n\nWhenever anyone suggests increasing the use of public transit virtually all Americans become the Koch brothers. People argue on how public transit is bad. From their perspective this isn't wrong necessarily, public transit is bad in the US but is it bad inherently or by design? \n\nPublic transportation is chronically underfunded and an afterthought in most American cities. There are, of course, places that public transit wouldn't really work (such as rural areas). However, in most cities where most Americans live improvements on the local public transit system would make it much more viable and sustainable way to get around.\n\nHowever, when the topic becomes public transit every American becomes a Republican politician under a Democratic Presidency and all of a sudden the costs are incredibly scrutinized.\n\n\"How much is it going to cost?\"\n\n\"Trains are too expensive\"\n\n\"It costs 1 billion per mile for NY subway\" (ignoring the billions spent on roads and highways)\n\n\"How are farmers in Wyoming going to use it\"\n\n\"Public transit sucks. It's dirty, it's slow, it's inefficient\".\n\n\"Poor people? Ew.\"\n\n\"There's serial killers on buses!!!\"\n\nIt's like almost every American becomes a suburban Karen. Instead of realizing that those are the result of bad policies and bad design or that if these policies were improved public transit would improve, they instead throw away the entire concept. \n\nIt's basically the Republican strategy; \n\n1. Say gov't is trash \n\n2. Underfund gov't \n\n3. Gov't is trash \n\n4. Profit.\n\nI think it's interesting because liberals and progressives are able to see beyond this line of reasoning in other areas, such as healthcare, education and the post system. They understand that funding and good policy is essential to getting good results from these public services. However, when it comes to public transportation they aren't able to make this leap. Can you imagine if this logic was consistent through out all policy?\n\n\"My local school system sucks so gov't funded education is bad\"\n\n\"My Obamacare plan sucks so gov't healthcare is bad\"\n\nMost liberals and progressives reject this type of logic when it comes to these issues but will then turn around and spout this:\n\n\"My local bus system sucks so public transportation is bad\". \n\nWhy?",

      "text": "**tl;dr: Carbrains rampaging about having to pay for school busses they don't use, I got upset and wrote a screed about why it's not a bad thing and helps illuminate generally why public transportation is important.**\n\nA recent conversation about dropping or charging additional fees for the bus at our daughter\u0019s school makes a good argument (in my mind) at least why public transportation should be subsidized.  I don\u0019t know if I\u0019ll be brave enough to share it with the other families there, but we\u0019ll see ... I suspect that their angry posts on Whatsapp will fall on deaf ears, and I shouldn't feed the trolls.  But I had to write it.  But for this community, any thoughts on how to improve the argument or whether I should share it?\n\nAn argument that we heard from those who drive their kids to school was: \\`\\`It\u0019s not fair that the general school budget pays for kids to ride the bus, the cost of riding the bus should fall entirely on those who ride it.\u0019\u0019\n\nThe counterargument that I would make is that there are benefits to drivers from those riding the bus, but they are perhaps hard to see.  They are, in my mind: less congestion on the roads, a commitment to the environment, and a more welcoming school.  I\u0019ll talk about each of them individually first and then connect it back to how the same argument applies to society generally.\n\nEveryone at the school complains about how dangerous and crowded the dropoff area is in the morning: ending the bus program or making it more expensive would encourage more people to drive to school.  The facilities there are already pushed to the limit; disinvesting from the bus would mean having to spend even more money on parking lots and traffic control (I\u0019ll point out that bus riders are subsidizing the parking lots with *their* tuition & I would hope that they begin charging those who drive for parking and for road maintenance if everyone needs to pay their fare share).    \n\nLikewise, the school likes to crow about how green it is, going so far as to install solar panels.  But if the school legitimately wants to reduce its carbon footprint, getting *more* students riding the bus is the most immediate and cost-effective way to accomplish those goals.  Moreover, the school is in tension with its neighbors; more traffic on Chateau drive will make the local leaders less likely to be okay with future school expansion (which is a stated goal) even if it has the road capacity to handle more students.\n\nAnd there are some families for whom it is easier to drive their kids to school than for others.  The bus could be the difference between them attending or not.  Their parents might not be able to drive because they lack the ability to drive (e.g., because of health reasons, as afflicted our family recently, thankfully temporarily), because of work obligation, or because they live in a part of the city where it doesn\u0019t make sense to own a car (or multiple cars).  Those students might well disappear entirely from the school if the bus becomes unaffordable or unavailable.\n\nAnd all of these apply generally to society as well: less public transportation means more traffic and more money spent on roads, there is a very high cost to giving away free parking, public transportation and walkable communities are the best path toward a carbon neutral future, and public transportation makes people who would otherwise not be a part of society able to participate.\n\nAnd sadly, what I expect will happen at the school is that the subsidy will likely disappear and that\u0014like many American public transportation options\u0014it will enter a death spiral: the service will be cut back, it will cease to be a reliable option for many, the per-rider costs will soar, and then it will cease to be sustainable, leading to cancellation entirely.  And I believe that this will leave the school worse off: more traffic, a less diverse student body, and less sustainable. ",

Also, it's labelled as a \"historic\" village, meaning it's full of old-timey people. I'm not saying it's impossible it was caught on camera, but the odds are slim to none.

Already, that will be 5-6 years of not having an urgent or consistent need to drive a car. So based on my lifestyle and future plans, getting a drivers license is not really at the top of my list of priorities for the near future.\n\nMy family on the other hand, more so my older relatives, are very judgmental and think I'm being immature and childish. Because to them, driving a car = being an adult. Even though I am incredibly self-reliant and independent already without needing to drive a car. I do great in school, and I've never been rebellious or anything as a teen, so I'm honestly offended that my family is upset with me because of this. I am proud to be a bicyclist; to me it represents staying true to my values, beliefs, and passions.\n\nNot only do I actually enjoy riding my bike, but I honestly feel guilty every time I'm in a car. Because of the CO2 it emits as well as the overall city infrastructure that driving encourages, which is not very sustainable or even pleasant from my experience. I don't want to dedicate my time learning a skill that I don't want to learn, nor do I think I will use. My parents have also always struggled financially, so I honestly don't know why they want me to drive and spend more money on gas, etc.! Riding my bike costs nothing. \n\nI don't think I am being childish or immature. I think I am making a reasonable, mature, and individualistic decision for myself. Why is riding a bike instead of driving seen as less than? Do you think biking labels people? or brands them, like as people who are \"eco freaks\" or less wealthy, etc. Maybe that's why my family wants me to drive :/\n\n In my opinion, choosing to ride a bike when you have the opportunity to drive is a brave and bold decision, one that I respect.",

It happens to be the most sustainable way of living and financially very advantageous.\n\nI have access to high paying jobs and spend close to nothing on transportation (maybe a few hundreds per year in bike maintenance and transit fare). I also pay very little in utilities because apartment buildings are inherently efficient so I hardly pay anything in heating bills and fees.\n\nGroceries have become marginally more expensive but this is the same for people living in the countryside. The only thing I spend more on is rent but it scales with salaries and job opportunities in a way that I come up ahead anyway I look at it.\n\nI feel very fortunate. I have close to zero liability as it\u0019s very unlikely I will cause significant damage to someone or something while walking or cycling. My health benefits from the daily exercise and I hardly ever had to get medical attention - costs here are kept to a minimum.\n\nBut&\n\nThat lifestyle is seen as the lifestyle of a looser, or a freak. Almost everyone in my social circles wonder what I\u0019m doing. My kiddo has other schoolchildren berate him because we are \u001cpoor\u001d because we don\u0019t have a car.\n\nMy friends either moved to the suburbs to buy single family houses or dream about it. I don\u0019t know what to tell them and resent the distance (both physical and societal) that it places between us.\n\nI *could* buy a house outside of the city and I *could* buy a fancy car, I just don\u0019t want to.\n\nIt\u0019s not that I really care about other people\u0019s judgment but it does exclude me even tacitly from a big part of society. And this is in a city with about 40% of car-free households. I can\u0019t imagine how worse it must be anywhere else.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading that nonsense. Have a great day.",

Employees flying in are told not to rent a car, but we are responsible for our own transportation to/from the hotel, the office, an offsite happy hour and an offsite lunch. The offsite lunch is for teams to get together separately and we have to choose where we go. There are half a dozen decent restaurants nearby but they are all across a major road that has no crosswalks. I have more than 5 people. I am going to have to request 2 separate Ubers to take people ACROSS THE STREET for lunch. Also it takes 10+ minutes to get an Uber out there. \n\nThe people that plan the party are local so of course have no concept of how inconvenient this plan is and how wasteful it is to have chosen a location for the event so far from civilization. I know they don\u0019t mean to make it difficult but good GRACIOUS can\u0019t people imagine what it might be like not to have a car? Especially when they are actually forcing people to be without it since they won\u0019t pay for it. Unlike me, most people *do* have cars but wont have them during their event. One of their only exposures to living car free only shows them how difficult it is. \n\nThe kicker is we purport to be a \u001csustainable\u001d company. Oh my god i\u0019m so pissed.",

Does this sound sustainable? Is either one of us delusional?\n\nThanks so much for your providing us with the resources necessary to make me realize I'm not that crazy... I can't even begin to express how alienated I'd felt to be surrounded by people who've never met anyone else who doesn't drive a car for my whole life.",

I would not consider myself part of the left but would definitely consider myself anti-car. I think it is very important to highlight that this movement is actually bipartisan and an excellent opportunity for both sides of the aisle to work together.\n\nMany of the arguments this movement makes center around left-leaning causes such as sustainability, and social justice; however, I believe many people on the right side of the spectrum overlook the conservative arguments this movement makes. This movement goes hand-in-hand with the urbanist movement which promotes communalism, traditional urban design, and local governance; all of which are conservative values. There are even people here who argue that the best method of solving car-domination is to eliminate zoning controls and promote a laissez-faire urban development model, again a right-leaning argument. Additionally, I don't see too many people on the right arguing for the elimination of government monopolies on things such as water and electricity utilities, yet many conservatives would get up in arms over nationalizing railroads, despite them being a natural monopoly like other utilities.\n\nMy concluding point here is that this movement is not a partisan movement and will benefit everyone if its goals are allowed to be achieved. Conservatives and other people on the right should not be scared of this movement and should take the Orange Pill.",

And even there you see how much predominant cars are in the daily life. Modal share of cars is always above 60% inside cities, even those with high bike usage. Cities in Austria and Germany average 30-40%.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on why this is, also who visited the country?\n\nItalians are car slaves like the US with a very different GDP. These are my thoughts.\n\n1. car culture was brought into politics, and  being very inefficient and unstable never actually cared to make national plans to increase sustainable modal shares\n2. local administrations don't limit car parking enough even in walkable and cycling friendly cities, there's still the idea that parking is a \"right\"\n3. 2. leads to a lot of illegal parking (cause the space is not enough) and those are tolerated by everyone, both citizens and local police\n4. lack of transit networks, seen as \"for the poor\", Italy has the lowest rate of subways and trams density, they \"invested\" all into buses which are usually stuck in car traffic and with a limited service, usually for those unfortunate to not have a car (lower income people and students)\n5. outside the city centers (the LTZs) urban quality is generally very poor, anti-pedestrians and anti-cyclists, places you're not really invited to be in, just to pass by (with a car)\n6. cycling infrastructure is simply ridiculous, even those cities that have pretty decent high cycling share are poorly maintained, shared with pedestrians, not connected together or end when they're actually needed (always based on the idea that cars are more important and you should not disturb them), the only exception are maybe cities in South Tyrol like Bozen/Bolzano.\n7. the current Minister of Transportation is about to make things worse: he proposed a law where speed checkers will not longer will be legal inside cities within 50km/h and suburban roads within 90km/h, which is basically 95% of the roads, limit the autonomy of local administration to build bike lanes and pedestrians areas and much more. A direct attack to livable cities policies. The same minister also sued the city of Bologna for now being a 30km/h city (using the safety guidelines he signed years before, yeah...) check this short [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ETrxEpUymKM](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ETrxEpUymKM)",

Seventy years ago, planners sold these highways as progress, essential to our future prosperity. The automobile promised freedom, and highways were going to take us there. Instead, they divided cities, displaced people from their homes, chained us to our cars, and locked us into a high-emissions future. And the more highways we built, the worse traffic got. Nowhere is this more visible than in Texas. In Houston, Dallas, and Austin, residents and activists are fighting against massive, multi-billion-dollar highway expansions that will claim thousands of homes and businesses, entrenching segregation and sprawl.  \n   \n*City Limits* covers the troubling history of America\u0019s urban highways and the battle over their future in Austin, Dallas, and Houston, following residents who risk losing their homes and businesses to planned expansions and examining successful highway removals in cities like Rochester, New York, to argue that we must dismantle these city-splitting roadways to ensure a more just, sustainable future.\n\nMore about the book here: [https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711708/city-limits-by-megan-kimble/](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711708/city-limits-by-megan-kimble/) \n\nAnd me, here: [https://www.megankimble.com](https://www.megankimble.com) &amp; https://twitter.com/megankimble  \n   \nAsk me anything!

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

      "title": "I\u0019m sick and tired of the same excuses drivers come up with to continue burning gasoline on a warming planet",
      "text": "Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:\n\n**\u001cMy emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d**\n\nThis is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth\u0019s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t afford an electric car.\u001d**\n\nNo one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There\u0019s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\u001d**\n\nYou *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dDriving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nCommute times should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cThere\u0019s no infrastructure to bike where I live.\u001d**\n\nAny road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThe infrastructure isn\u0019t ready yet.\u001d**\n\nWe don\u0019t have time: not only is our planet\u0019s climate destabilizing, it\u0019s destabilizing quickly. We can\u0019t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it\u0019s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.\n\n**\u001cMy workplace is out of reach of biking distance.\u001d**\n\nConsider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can\u0019t, then consider finding another job that\u0019s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn\u0019t be the priority when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI\u0019m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.\u001d**\n\nUnless you\u0019re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t carry my groceries on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThere\u0019s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t ride a bike in the cold.\u001d**\n\nWear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cNot everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThen go for an adult tricycle instead. Don\u0019t set that option aside so quickly when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThere wouldn\u0019t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.\u001d**\n\nIf more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet\u0019s climate from destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t like waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nBring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI don\u0019t like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d**\n\nComfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dHow can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\u001d**\n\nAre you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?\n\n**\u001dYour use of a device that\u0019s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we\u0019re focusing on.\n\n**\u001d[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.\n\nThe bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren\u0019t insignificant at all. You can\u0019t shift the blame on \u001ccorporations\u001d or \u001cinfrastructure\u001d when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.\n\nEDITS:\n\nIt turns out r/fuckcars has *way* more car apologists hiding among its members than one would expect!\n\nDrinking game!

      "text": "Ah! As the title states, I just broke my 12 year lurking streak to create an account to subscribe to this sub.\n\nI\u0019ve been lurking since 2010, back when it was mostly great memes, casually scrolling the front page. I know the time suck of Reddit without an account so I never wanted to make one and dive further in.\n\nBut I just saw this sub on the front page for the first time and Ah! My people! I\u0019ve found you! I just about shit myself when I found the unofficial directory post of other similar communities. \n\nI grew up in pretty rural town, Red Lodge, MT. It\u0019s all cars out in MT but that\u0019s cool because there\u0019s a lot of space out here. \n\nI went to University in Eugene Oregon, and they have a stellar bike path and decent public transportation system. It was here where I started to notice how convenient and efficient biking and public transit is. There\u0019s a bike path along the entire river in the city, and many bike specific bridges crossing it. How cool. \n\nAfter University I moved to Daegu, South Korea to teach English. This is where the lid was blown off. The biking and public transit in this city was AMAZING! Life changing. My perspective changed and it can never change back. I had a subway stop on my street that put you right into the subway network. Getting around the city was a breeze. I never even had to explore the extensive bus system because the subway (and autonomous light rail) was so effective. Best part? This subway system would connect to the train system and then again to subway systems in other cities. My friends and I would often work all day, hop onto the subway after work, jet across the country on a high speed train to Seoul, hop into their subway network, pop up right at our desired location, party all night, and then reverse the order and be back to our respective apartments back in Daegu by sunrise. It was sofa king fun and convenient. \n\nThe bike path systems in Korea were also incredible. Every river had a bike path (kinda sad cuz they\u0019d abandoned trying to keep any sort of natural feel or function to the river banks, but that\u0019s another topic). Maybe others can expand on this, I\u0019m pretty sure there are bike paths connecting the cities around the country. I didn\u0019t utilize it to its full extent, but man was it great biking along the rivers around the city. \n\nI had a native Korean girlfriend who was 25 years old. She never had a license or drove a car. When I questioned her why, she said, \u001cwhy would I ever need to drive?\u001d. Between the taxis, buses, subways, and trails, having or driving a car was completely unnecessary. \n\nFast forward some extensive traveling and utilizing public transit in cities like Beijing (circle method used here not so sick), Fukuoka, and Kuala Lumpur, I\u0019m a geek for it. \n\nI moved back to MT, aptly nick named the \u001cLast Best Place\u001d, to a town called Bozeman. If you aren\u0019t clued in yet, Bozeman, MT is BOOMING. Insane population growth and development happening here. After seeing a swath of the world, there\u0019s certainly cool things cities and communities can develop, and there\u0019s definite some shite ones. Sadly, Bozeman is adopting no cool ones. The development is going gangbusters and the city commission has almost zero initiatives for biking or public transit. There\u0019s zero flow to the city, the traffic is piling up, and the development is entirely based around cars. I\u0019m talking massive parking and road requirements, wasted space and atrocious suburban sprawl everywhere. \n\nIt\u0019s so sad to watch a city with all the resources to be a pioneer of conscious and sustainable urban development in the \u001cnew frontier\u001d miss the mark so badly. If there\u0019s any strategies or resources for this specific problem, please share. \n\nI haven\u0019t totally been idle on this issue above, as I presented a Pecha Kucha on the topic to a sold out theater a couple years back. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/5i5JorNlaF0) Let me know what you think!\n\nAlso, I recently stumbled across a larger passenger train movement for the state of MT. I\u0019m assuming you\u0019re unfamiliar, so AmTrak runs thru MT in the north part of the state, where relatively nobody lives, and does not run through the south part of the state where most all of the population resides. The idea of this movement is to implement passenger trains in the southern rail line to connect all the urban centers of Missoula, Butte, Bozeman, and Billings. The larger goal would be to connect Bozeman to SLC and Billings to Denver as they are relatively straight shots. Check out that movement here. [Big Sky Rail Authority](https://montanapassengerrailsummit.org/big-sky-passenger-rail-authority)\n\nWoof, anyways, long winded rant over. Trains rule. Light rails &gt; subways. Bike specific paths only please. Fuck cars. Conscious, efficient, development only. \n\nTLDR: my first post. Korea has awesome public transit that changed my life. Bozeman is dropping the ball and becoming a car wasteland. Watch my passion presentation. [Traffic and Parking suck](https://youtu.be/5i5JorNlaF0)",

      "text": "\nFrom the link:\n\n**EU institutions commit to boost cycling across Europe**\n\nToday [3rd of April, 2024], the EU is taking another important step in reducing transport emissions by adopting the European Declaration on Cycling. In the margins of the Informal Transport European Council, Adina V\u0003lean, Commissioner for Transport, will sign the declaration together with Karima Delli, Chair of the Transport Commitee of the European Parliament and Georges Gilkinet, Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium.\n\nThe declaration recognises cycling as a sustainable, accessible, and affordable means of transport, with strong added value for the EU economy. It includes clear commitments, such as safe and coherent cycling networks in cities, better links with public transport and secure parking spaces and access to recharging points for e-bikes. These commitments shall be taken at EU, national regional and local level. These are all necessary elements in improving the quality and quantity of cycling infrastructure across Member States and making cycling more attractive to the public.\n\nBased on a proposal launched by the European Commission in October 2023 and responding to requests from the European Parliament and Member States, the declaration constitutes a joint political commitment and a strategic compass for existing and future policies and initiatives related to cycling.\n\nCommissioner for Transport, Adina V\u0003lean, said: \"We recognise cycling's myriad benefits: it reduces pollution, eases urban congestion, and promotes healthier lifestyles. Moreover, cycling is a cornerstone of the European industry, driving innovation and growth while creating high-quality local jobs. Embracing cycling aligns with the EU's industrial strategy and its objectives.\"\n\nNow the EU parliament doesn\u0019t make the law and certainly not municipal or local regulations that are most likely to bring concrete changes. But you can use this document to argue and demand action from whoever oversees your part of the world. Get to work EU citizens!",

      "text": "Hey, I'm an Ojibwe woman and I\u0019ve been feeling the need to add what many Indigenous people\u0019s experience of urban planning and public transit is in the US and Canada, because there's hardly anyone online who mentions how it has affected us and how devastating it is for future generations.\n\nI\u0019ve found that whenever Canada and the USA\u0019s history of city-building is talked about, it starts off with how European settlers made walkable areas, and then down the line, mention redlining, zoning and white flight. I think it\u0019s really important though, to add that settlers essentially zoned from the beginning of colonization on this continent \u0013 hence the existence of reserves/reservations.\\*\n\nThe source of a lot of Indigenous folks\u0019 present-day struggles is that the lands our ancestors were sequestered to had little to offer under a foreign government\u0019s version of economy. Everything suddenly needed to be about profit, and for a time, it was illegal to live traditionally, so we were screwed over from day 1.\n\nCommunities in reserves are essentially small towns/villages, but most have some major things in common with suburbia: These areas are residential, they hardly generate revenue, they aren't self-sustaining, and so they rely heavily on external financial support. In a way, suburbs are just reserves for middle-class and rich people.\n\nIn a /fuckcars perspective, reserve communities practically show the future lives of people living in sprawl: Eventually there\u0019s not enough jobs nearby to go around due to a wide area of low density. Single-family homes become multi-generational. Eventually, cars and highways just aren't fast enough to justify taking a job that's far, far away. And so the poverty really sets in. There\u0019s a point where communities absolutely need to have trains or else they\u0019re stuck in a bubble.\n\nI don't want to give off the impression that every rez is the same, because they aren't. The ones that happen to be a half-hour's drive away from cities tend to have richer residents. Car centrism though, is the norm that keeps the post-apocalyptic era going for Indigenous folks.\n\nMaking reserves thrive is tough because a lot of things have to improve alongside each other. There\u0019s inherently a problem though, when the only way to do a drive from a community to a workplace is with a car. While some reserves are too remote (ex. Attawapiskat, Ontario), there\u0019s reserves that would benefit from having a train or bus passing by that goes to the next city over. If a city is a 1 hour drive away, what a miracle it would be if it became a half-hour train ride.\n\nIgnorant people always ask, \u001cwell, why don\u0019t those Natives move?\u001d A bunch of us have though. In Canada, half of Indigenous people live off-rez (including myself), and in the US, it\u0019s about 80%. A significant number made the leap then raised their children in colonial towns and cities, and some rose out of poverty. But the cycle of poverty continues for a lot of us urban Natives \u0013 living off the rez is expensive. We\u0019re crippled by rising costs of living like everyone else is, and the fact that a car has been made to be a basic need in life doesn\u0019t help. That climb out of poverty is much longer when a car is needed.\n\nI'm preaching to the choir now, so I\u0019ll leave it at that. I hope this widens your perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I grew up in Canada, everyone tends to say \u001creserve\u001d or \u001cFirst Nation\u001d here.",

I can get there by public transport, but it takes over an hour in one direction.

      "title": "On using people with disabilities as a reason to continue car dependence.",
      "text": "I have disabilities. And as someone with disabilities, I do not appreciate hearing, \"but, people with disabilities!\", which is often used by proponents of continued car dependence. I do not appreciate hearing that walkable/accessible cities are inherently \"ableist\".\n\nMy own situation is as follows: I have heat and exercise intolerance due to autonomic dysfunction. My blood pressure can drop suddenly if I overheat, causing me to faint. I also have vertebral dissections, which reduce how much blood reaches my brain. It also raises my stroke risk. The symptoms of this can be exacerbated by heat as well.\n\nDespite this, and how it means I cannot always walk or cycle places, especially with the heat waves in my area, I will **always** advocate for walkable/accessible cities.\n\nMy first beef with, \"but people with disabilities!\" is not every disability is the same. Disabilities are not homogeneous. There are varying needs. Yes, some people will **always** need to take a vehicle because of their limitations or health circumstances. Some people cannot transport themselves voluntarily, be it in a wheelchair or otherwise. Some people need to be in a climate-controlled environment because autonomic problems make it prohibitively hard to maintain their body temperature, especially in hot summer months or cold winters, as is often the case with me.\n\nHowever, is not *always* the case for me. It's not the case with many other people, either.\n\nFurthermore, it is disingenuous to claim that having a disability = needing to drive or use a car. Many people with disabilities cannot drive, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot walk, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot ride a bicycle, but can ride an ebike. Many people cannot walk, but can drive a scooter. Many people have ups and downs with their disabilities where they can sometimes function better or worse, so their abilities **fluctuate.**\n\nThis is not a one-size-fits-all situation. There is more nuance than that. The idea that car dependence is somehow a blanket solution is mired in a simplified, naïve presumption of what disability is, and isn't, and it's putting words in the mouths of everyone who has a disability.\n\nWe need to talk about the **economic burden** of personal vehicle ownership as well. Vehicle ownership is often touted as some kind of gold standard for PWD accommodation, but the reality is, many people with disabilities require DME (durable medical equipment). These devices include, among others: small daily living aids, ambulatory aids like canes and crutches, bathroom aids, special beds and bedding, scooters, wheelchairs, ventilators, oxygen therapy, lifts, hearing aids, etc. These can be very costly. I have a piece of DME that recently cost me $1,400 to purchase. Some people need costly medication too.\n\nThis creates a financial burden, which only worsens if someone cannot work because of their disabilities, or if they otherwise need to work less than is economically viable. Disability assistance does exist, but it doesn't even come **close** to covering the cost of housing, unless you're crammed into a place with multiple roommates. This is effectively hidden homelessness.\n\nIn Vancouver, a generally walkable city, the baseline PWD payment for a single person is under $1,500. The average rent for an unfurnished, one-bedroom apartment is over [$2,300.](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/vancouver-rent-prices-july-2023-7262184)\n\nAnd forget covering all the other costs.\n\nIf you can't do that, you are forced into the suburbs.\n\nBut unfortunately, despite the decrease in housing costs in the suburbs, owning a personal vehicle generally still means you're paying a **ton.** Vehicles take a massive chunk out of someone's earnings, often hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, according to Stefan Gossling's oft-cited [study.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003943) Personal vehicles make it even harder for someone with a disability to get ahead, forcing them to merely subsist.\n\nCompulsory personal vehicle ownership, as a result of car dependence, is often accompanied by sprawl as well. This creates an overabundance of suburban areas and roads that may not even have sidewalks. Due to potentially reduced income, people with disabilities often need to live in suburban areas, as opposed to city centers, which often have higher housing costs. If someone with a disability lives in a suburban area, and they cannot get around without a car, they need to remain at home unless they have someone to drive them around. This chauffeuring needs to fit both peoples' schedules. For many people, this vastly reduced opportunity for casual and spontaneous interaction can be very isolating, and lead to mental health deficits.\n\nEven if someone is capable of getting around by themselves, whether because they are ambulatory or have a wheelchair or other mobility device, it may not be feasible for them to venture from home. For example, if someone is visually impaired and cannot drive, but can still get around by walking, they still may not be able to leave their suburbs unless they walk a **very long** distance, for a long time - and unless they are willing to compromise their safety. Many newly-developed suburbs do not even have sidewalks. This makes independent living prohibitive for many people.\n\nCar-dependence proponents will often claim if someone has a disability and cannot drive, they can just get someone to drive them places. This is not possible in many cases. Not everyone has relatives or friends on standby to drive them places. Some people have not been able to make social connections because of their disability. Some people may have a connection or two, but the connection is too far away (which is often due to sprawl, and how isolated different neighborhoods can be) to provide reliable service. The very idea is rooted in ableism and naïve thinking.\n\nBut let's imagine a scenario where someone, in spite of the lack of sidewalks in their neighborhood, decides to go to a store. Because of car dependence, they will be exposed to noise pollution, which is known to inappropriately arouse and harm the sympathetic nervous system, as documented [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) and [here.](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8f98-tph-How-Loud-is-Too-Loud-Health-Impacts-Environmental-Noise.pdf) This is especially stressful for people with sensory issues, such as autism and even PTSD. They will be exposed to road pollution, which also negatively impacts health, as documented [here,](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/sc-hc/H144-91-2022-eng.pdf) [here,](https://archive.li/xIyBP) and [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855107/) Due to hostile road designs resulting from car dependence, they will also be [especially vulnerable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) to traffic violence.\n\n**And here's a stark reality:** car violence causes an untold number of disabilities in previously able-bodied people. Many people become disabled because vehicles strike them while driving way too fast to be safe, when in reality, those vehicles should be going very, very slowly anywhere that pedestrians and vehicles mix. But this is conveniently ignored by proponents of car dependence. In addition, many able-bodied people will experience an injury or disability at some point in their lives, for some reason or another, and it may prevent them from driving.\n\nI know multiple people who have sprained ankles and needed crutches. What happens if their right foot is seriously injured?\n\nMore pressingly, why are these scenarios always *totally overlooked* by proponents of car dependence? (Don't answer that. It was [rhetorical.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias))\n\nReducing dependence on personal vehicles means roads will require less frequent maintenance. This means more funds will be available for sidewalks, so more areas can actually get sidewalks in the first place, and the existing sidewalks can be widened/improved so people in wheelchairs, on crutches, and so on don't need to play hopscotch on broken (or incomplete) concrete to get around. Or, people can use personal mobility lanes if they don't want to go *bump-bump-bump* over sidewalk cracks. Not only will sidewalks and mobility lanes have more funding, but it will allow a city to spend more money on accessibility amenities, including benches, shady structures, large trees, cooling stations, water fountains, and public washrooms, which everyone in a community can use.\n\nLess roads also means there will be less asphalt to absorb heat. This can lower the overall ambient temperature, reducing the effect of [heat islands.](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/articles/pavement_thermal.cfm) There are a few videos out there of people cooking eggs on sidewalks - asphalt retains [even more heat](https://www.forconstructionpros.com/concrete/article/22210872/igga-international-grooving-grinding-association-study-on-concrete-pavement-factor-in-urban-heat-island-uhi-effect) due to the darker material. Vegetation, and the shade created by it, also helps reduce ambient temperature.\n\nWhen streets are designed for people first, and safety first, it will also reduce the chances of vehicle-related accidents. The overall noise levels will become quieter, both ambient tire noise and honking, making it more pleasant for people with sensory issues to move around outside. Noise-cancelling headphones may not be as necessary. Visually impaired people would not be subjected to victim-blaming tips like \"watch for turning drivers\", when they often literally *cannot* watch for them, as there would be more emphasis on driver caution, and better prophylactic street safety features, instead of pedestrian caution.\n\nThe logistics of driving for people with disabilities will **also** improve. In a less car-dependent place, someone with a disability will not need to compete with able-bodied people over parking, and thus, they (or the person driving them) won't need to stress out about it. Parking will be easier to find. Since there will be less drivers on the road, there will be a lower chance of someone parking in the disabled parking spot at businesses when they shouldn't have.\n\nIt's just **less stressful.** There will be less hypotheticals, and less contingency planning that needs to be done in the realm of transporting oneself. To me, this feels liberating. Due to my disabilities, I always need to think three steps ahead to plan for unexpected things. Car dependence adds another layer of \"what if\" to that. Finding a parking spot, timed parking limits, payment, accidents on the way (I have been rear-ended in standstill traffic before), etc.\n\nThis isn't the only thing car dependence adds in a negative way.\n\nAs someone with disabilities, I feel that my life and daily activities are restricted by default, simply by merit of my disability existing. Proponents of car dependence are not allies. And they are not doing people with disabilities any favours by insisting that car dependence, aka the continued neglect of our **personal choice** on how to transport ourselves around, is the way forward. That just adds additional restrictions. It removes an element of agency that doesn't need to be absent in the first place. That isn't right.\n\nThere needs to be a choice at minimum. Right now, there isn't a choice in far, far too many places.\n\n**All of that said:**\n\nI do have concerns and fears about accessible city implementation, as do others. These concerns are not unfounded. New infrastructure can completely miss the mark on ADA/ADA compliance. Buses can lack air conditioning (this is a **major** issue for me in Vancouver). Many older buildings are walkups and do not have lifts, making them inaccessible to people who use mobility devices. Some public transport centers do not have elevators within reasonable distance to stairs, forcing people with mobility devices to detour extensively, soaking up time. Many bus stops lack both shelter/shade and benches, so I need to sit on the ground. And I am constantly bothered by how few public washrooms there are for people with gastrointestinal issues. It is degrading to need to enter a random Starbucks and silently head to the washroom, because the duty of providing such a basic amenity has been shunted off to nearby businesses (usually because a municipality refuses to fund the regular maintenance of facilities like this).\n\n**However,** these implementation problems do not make the notion of an accessible/walkable city inherently ableist in itself. The problem is with the **implementation** and the allocation of resources toward fixing the flaws, not the concept. It is manipulative to insist the opposite is true, and therefore that accessible/walkable cities should not exist.\n\nI will not say, \"but the buses are unbearably hot, therefore, I hate accessible/walkable cities\".\n\nI will say, \"fix the fucking buses, I have places to go without a car\".",

The short of it is that if you want cities to be more sustainable/better, get rid of the codified ways they've been forced to be that way - parking mandates, density restrictions, designing for cars only.\n\nThese types of regulations are what give us the uninspiring, car-centric and fundamentally unsustainable cities prevalent across North America.

In the margins of the Informal Transport European Council, Adina V\u0003lean, Commissioner for Transport, will sign the declaration together with Karima Delli, Chair of the Transport Commitee of the European Parliament and Georges Gilkinet, Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium.\n\nThe declaration recognises cycling as a sustainable, accessible, and affordable means of transport, with strong added value for the EU economy. It includes clear commitments, such as safe and coherent cycling networks in cities, better links with public transport and secure parking spaces and access to recharging points for e-bikes. These commitments shall be taken at EU, national regional and local level. These are all necessary elements in improving the quality and quantity of cycling infrastructure across Member States and making cycling more attractive to the public.\n\nBased on a proposal launched by the European Commission in October 2023 and responding to requests from the European Parliament and Member States, the declaration constitutes a joint political commitment and a strategic compass for existing and future policies and initiatives related to cycling.\n\nCommissioner for Transport, Adina V\u0003lean, said: \"We recognise cycling's myriad benefits: it reduces pollution, eases urban congestion, and promotes healthier lifestyles. Moreover, cycling is a cornerstone of the European industry, driving innovation and growth while creating high-quality local jobs. Embracing cycling aligns with the EU's industrial strategy and its objectives.\"\n\nNow the EU parliament doesn\u0019t make the law and certainly not municipal or local regulations that are most likely to bring concrete changes.

      "text": "Air pollution is a major environmental health risk \u0014 the links between air pollution and health conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are well established. Though less well-understood, there is substantial evidence that air pollution also impacts mental health.\n\nPast research has associated air pollution with higher levels of stress, psychological distress, increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer\u0019s and depression. Other research has linked short-term exposure to peaks in air pollution with an increased risk of death among people with serious mental illness. New research specifically points to impacts on the brains and mental health of children.\n\nFor example, a large study of people in the U.S. and Denmark found that exposure to air pollution \u001cis significantly associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders,\u001d including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and personality disorder. (Kahn, et al) While studies have found associations between air pollution and mental health problems, how it might influence mental health is not well understood. The authors of the U.S. and Danish study suggest their research points to neuroinflammatory mechanisms linking air pollution and psychiatric consequences.\n\nA recent review looked at more than 100 studies on the effects of outdoor air pollution on mental health and regions of the brain that regulate emotions, focusing on the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex. The researchers found that 73% of the studies reported higher mental health symptoms and behaviors in humans and animals after exposure to higher-than-average levels of air pollution. The lead author of the study, Clara G. Zundel, Ph.D., concluded in a World Economic Forum report: \u001cPeople who breathe polluted air experience changes within the brain regions that control emotions, and as a result, they may be more likely to develop anxiety and depression than those who breathe cleaner air.\u001d \n\nAnd a study from researchers at Harvard, published in March 2023, adds to the evidence connecting exposure to air pollution (small particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide) to increased risk for dementia.\n\nAnother recent study looked at potential impacts on children and adolescents who may be particularly vulnerable as they experience critical periods of brain development. The review of research found evidence that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of depression symptoms and suicidal behaviors. They also found, through neuroimaging studies, evidence for associated structural and functional changes in the brain.\n\nThe findings of the large population study mentioned above suggest that poor air quality during the early years of an individual\u0019s life increases the risk of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorder, and major depression).\n\nExposure to air pollution may also exacerbate existing mental health conditions among children. A study published in Environmental Health Perspectives found an association between short-term exposure to elevated levels of air pollution and increased emergency room psychiatric visits among children.\n\nhttps://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/air-pollutions-impact-on-mental-health",

I passed the written test with flying colors but refused to take the driving test when I turned 16 to get my license. \n\nMy parents were irritated at me and tried to scare me by saying I would have to walk home from high school, which I didn\u0019t mind at all and continued to do for the rest of my time there (it was only two miles). \n\nSince then I\u0019ve lived in all sorts of places big and small. In college I lived in a fairly walkable city and when I had to go somewhere out on the \u001ccommercial strip\u001d I just took a shuttle or called a friend. When I was in Chicago I took public transportation everywhere and it was a breeze. After that I moved to work in Yosemite National Park and I could get to any city in the area with a bus then a train. Then I went to work way out in the remote Olympic Peninsula of Washington State and could get anywhere on an old bus line including Seattle or Olympia. \n\nNow I live in a city of about 100,000 in the American Southwest and the public transportation is pretty bad, but now I have a partner of five years who drives, and we live close enough to both of our jobs and downtown to walk. \n\nI guess all this is to say that I\u0019ve never felt like I\u0019ve missed out on a full life or any experiences or opportunities by making a firm decision to not drive at a young age and sticking to it. No matter where I\u0019ve lived I\u0019ve found solid ways to get to and from anywhere I needed, but I\u0019m always keeping my fingers crossed for more trains, busses, walkable cities etc. \n\nAnybody else out here never had a license?",

      "text": "I was thinking about how our reliance on cars creates some unexpected problems.\n\nFor example, in walkable cities, people shop for groceries frequently, often buying fresh items like bread daily. The nearest little shop where I live doesn't even sell long-shelf-life bread, which is understandable because we are used to the fresh stuff and wouldn't buy that unhealthy bread-like thing anyway.\n\nIn contrast, in many car-dependent areas, people shop maybe twice a month, so they're buying more processed and less fresh food that lasts longer. This obviously decreases the demand for fresh food. Nearby bakeries, small farms, butchers, etc., close, so job opportunities move farther away, making it necessary to have more cars and bigger roads.\n\nThere must be hundreds of little indirect consequences of car dependency. Some are, of course, well-known, like reduced physical activity, more social isolation, and increased pollution.

      "text": "So, a couple of times I've visited Canada Place, the main cruise ship terminal for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (getting there by the SkyTrain, of course). While the phrase \"cities aren't loud, cars are!\" is very much applicable in all cities that allows cars into them, to push that point home, not sure if anyone has noticed that a fricken cruise ship is quieter than cars!\n\nI've seen several cruise ships depart from Canada Place in person, and one of the main things that I notice is just how quiet they are (to the people on the docks at least). The ships don't produce any loud engine noise, with the only sounds being at most the gentle churning of the water from the maneuvering thrusters. And unless the ship is reversing, the cruise ships don't even horn (if they're facing forward when departing). The loudest part of the dock are the forklifts used to load luggage... and cheesy early 2000s music the ship plays.\n\nNote how I can fall asleep near a cruise ship and not even notice that it's leaving. Try falling asleep near a busy highway. \n\nUp North in Horseshoe Bay is a BC Ferries terminal, but the ferries are quiet, no horning when departing, with the nosiest part being the cars unloading, because cars. But apart from that, these modern passenger ships are quiet (at least to us landlubbers on shore).\n\nPS: I know cruise ships are an environmental disaster and they should be limited and/or no longer use diesel fuel. And that they *do* produce noise pollution that mainly affects marine animals underwater due to noise from the propellers reverberating through the water, etc. But I'm just mentioning how compared to cars, cruise ships are quieter, at least on the surface.",

Very rare.\n\n\nI was with a relative running an errand. We went to the wrong location by bus and were sent to a new address which was a few stops back. This time she wanted to take a taxi. We are both fully able healthy adults. I said no, listing the pollution, noise, and traffic and also it's supposed to be a day for other people to feel safe on the road while biking and roller skating etc.\n\n\nShe always wants to take a taxi everywhere.\n\n\n\nOur bus fares together would cost 5.40. She said the taxi would only be an extra +3.00 and she would pay for it. I insisted for the bus but she stopped a taxi and opened the door so I basically just gave in. \n\n (mostly because I didn't have that much money and would benefit from the free transport. Plus no internet on my phone would mean I would have a hard time finding the new address without her. But also because she caught me off guard and I didn't have time to think before the taxi was already opened.)\n\nThe taxi ended up costing her 12.40 due to surgecharges on certain festivities or something.\n\nBut on the way there, we stopped at a traffic light, and then I didn't see if the light had turned green, but the driver rushed to floor it and almost hit a woman and her child.\n\nI had a mixture of emotions. Mainly, and surprisingly, anger. We didn't have to take this taxi, this was completely unnecessary. It was unnecessary air pollution, unnecessary noise pollution, unnecessary traffic, unnecessary danger to pedestrians. This woman or her child could've been seriously injured for our selfish action. I hate our lack of consciousness and consideration for others. I felt guilty. \n\nWhen you take a taxi, you don't control the driver. The driver could be as irresponsible to human lives as they want because they want to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible. (They are also so inconsiderate by constantly honking. Same with rideshares. At least where I live.)\nAnd if they have no care for human life and they hurt someone, you where part of that, you funded that unnecessarily (if there was a safer alternative) therefore taking indirect part in the harm.\n\n\n\nAnyway today with this same relative, we needed to go on the bus just for about 4 stops and even though we were literally a few meters from the bus stop, she stopped a taxi. This time I refused and kept walking. Said I'll meet you there. Felt a weird sense of peace. She joined me on the bus.\n\n\n\n\nMind you, both of these locations are very near the bus stops mentioned so there is no further walking to account for. Less than 200m I'd say. The last location was literally in front of the bus stop. You just cross the street.",

      "title": "On using people with disabilities as a reason to continue car dependence.",
      "text": "I have disabilities. And as someone with disabilities, I do not appreciate hearing, \"but, people with disabilities!\", which is often used by proponents of continued car dependence. I do not appreciate hearing that walkable/accessible cities are inherently \"ableist\".\n\nMy own situation is as follows: I have heat and exercise intolerance due to autonomic dysfunction. My blood pressure can drop suddenly if I overheat, causing me to faint. I also have vertebral dissections, which reduce how much blood reaches my brain. It also raises my stroke risk. The symptoms of this can be exacerbated by heat as well.\n\nDespite this, and how it means I cannot always walk or cycle places, especially with the heat waves in my area, I will **always** advocate for walkable/accessible cities.\n\nMy first beef with, \"but people with disabilities!\" is not every disability is the same. Disabilities are not homogeneous. There are varying needs. Yes, some people will **always** need to take a vehicle because of their limitations or health circumstances. Some people cannot transport themselves voluntarily, be it in a wheelchair or otherwise. Some people need to be in a climate-controlled environment because autonomic problems make it prohibitively hard to maintain their body temperature, especially in hot summer months or cold winters, as is often the case with me.\n\nHowever, is not *always* the case for me. It's not the case with many other people, either.\n\nFurthermore, it is disingenuous to claim that having a disability = needing to drive or use a car. Many people with disabilities cannot drive, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot walk, but can ride a bicycle. Many people cannot ride a bicycle, but can ride an ebike. Many people cannot walk, but can drive a scooter. Many people have ups and downs with their disabilities where they can sometimes function better or worse, so their abilities **fluctuate.**\n\nThis is not a one-size-fits-all situation. There is more nuance than that. The idea that car dependence is somehow a blanket solution is mired in a simplified, naïve presumption of what disability is, and isn't, and it's putting words in the mouths of everyone who has a disability.\n\nWe need to talk about the **economic burden** of personal vehicle ownership as well. Vehicle ownership is often touted as some kind of gold standard for PWD accommodation, but the reality is, many people with disabilities require DME (durable medical equipment). These devices include, among others: small daily living aids, ambulatory aids like canes and crutches, bathroom aids, special beds and bedding, scooters, wheelchairs, ventilators, oxygen therapy, lifts, hearing aids, etc. These can be very costly. I have a piece of DME that recently cost me $1,400 to purchase. Some people need costly medication too.\n\nThis creates a financial burden, which only worsens if someone cannot work because of their disabilities, or if they otherwise need to work less than is economically viable. Disability assistance does exist, but it doesn't even come **close** to covering the cost of housing, unless you're crammed into a place with multiple roommates. This is effectively hidden homelessness.\n\nIn Vancouver, a generally walkable city, the baseline PWD payment for a single person is under $1,500. The average rent for an unfurnished, one-bedroom apartment is over [$2,300.](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/vancouver-rent-prices-july-2023-7262184)\n\nAnd forget covering all the other costs.\n\nIf you can't do that, you are forced into the suburbs.\n\nBut unfortunately, despite the decrease in housing costs in the suburbs, owning a personal vehicle generally still means you're paying a **ton.** Vehicles take a massive chunk out of someone's earnings, often hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, according to Stefan Gossling's oft-cited [study.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003943) Personal vehicles make it even harder for someone with a disability to get ahead, forcing them to merely subsist.\n\nCompulsory personal vehicle ownership, as a result of car dependence, is often accompanied by sprawl as well. This creates an overabundance of suburban areas and roads that may not even have sidewalks. Due to potentially reduced income, people with disabilities often need to live in suburban areas, as opposed to city centers, which often have higher housing costs. If someone with a disability lives in a suburban area, and they cannot get around without a car, they need to remain at home unless they have someone to drive them around. This chauffeuring needs to fit both peoples' schedules. For many people, this vastly reduced opportunity for casual and spontaneous interaction can be very isolating, and lead to mental health deficits.\n\nEven if someone is capable of getting around by themselves, whether because they are ambulatory or have a wheelchair or other mobility device, it may not be feasible for them to venture from home. For example, if someone is visually impaired and cannot drive, but can still get around by walking, they still may not be able to leave their suburbs unless they walk a **very long** distance, for a long time - and unless they are willing to compromise their safety. Many newly-developed suburbs do not even have sidewalks. This makes independent living prohibitive for many people.\n\nCar-dependence proponents will often claim if someone has a disability and cannot drive, they can just get someone to drive them places. This is not possible in many cases. Not everyone has relatives or friends on standby to drive them places. Some people have not been able to make social connections because of their disability. Some people may have a connection or two, but the connection is too far away (which is often due to sprawl, and how isolated different neighborhoods can be) to provide reliable service. The very idea is rooted in ableism and naïve thinking.\n\nBut let's imagine a scenario where someone, in spite of the lack of sidewalks in their neighborhood, decides to go to a store. Because of car dependence, they will be exposed to noise pollution, which is known to inappropriately arouse and harm the sympathetic nervous system, as documented [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) and [here.](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8f98-tph-How-Loud-is-Too-Loud-Health-Impacts-Environmental-Noise.pdf) This is especially stressful for people with sensory issues, such as autism and even PTSD. They will be exposed to road pollution, which also negatively impacts health, as documented [here,](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/sc-hc/H144-91-2022-eng.pdf) [here,](https://archive.li/xIyBP) and [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855107/) Due to hostile road designs resulting from car dependence, they will also be [especially vulnerable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001575) to traffic violence.\n\n**And here's a stark reality:** car violence causes an untold number of disabilities in previously able-bodied people. Many people become disabled because vehicles strike them while driving way too fast to be safe, when in reality, those vehicles should be going very, very slowly anywhere that pedestrians and vehicles mix. But this is conveniently ignored by proponents of car dependence. In addition, many able-bodied people will experience an injury or disability at some point in their lives, for some reason or another, and it may prevent them from driving.\n\nI know multiple people who have sprained ankles and needed crutches. What happens if their right foot is seriously injured?\n\nMore pressingly, why are these scenarios always *totally overlooked* by proponents of car dependence? (Don't answer that. It was [rhetorical.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias))\n\nReducing dependence on personal vehicles means roads will require less frequent maintenance. This means more funds will be available for sidewalks, so more areas can actually get sidewalks in the first place, and the existing sidewalks can be widened/improved so people in wheelchairs, on crutches, and so on don't need to play hopscotch on broken (or incomplete) concrete to get around. Or, people can use personal mobility lanes if they don't want to go *bump-bump-bump* over sidewalk cracks. Not only will sidewalks and mobility lanes have more funding, but it will allow a city to spend more money on accessibility amenities, including benches, shady structures, large trees, cooling stations, water fountains, and public washrooms, which everyone in a community can use.\n\nLess roads also means there will be less asphalt to absorb heat. This can lower the overall ambient temperature, reducing the effect of [heat islands.](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/articles/pavement_thermal.cfm) There are a few videos out there of people cooking eggs on sidewalks - asphalt retains [even more heat](https://www.forconstructionpros.com/concrete/article/22210872/igga-international-grooving-grinding-association-study-on-concrete-pavement-factor-in-urban-heat-island-uhi-effect) due to the darker material. Vegetation, and the shade created by it, also helps reduce ambient temperature.\n\nWhen streets are designed for people first, and safety first, it will also reduce the chances of vehicle-related accidents. The overall noise levels will become quieter, both ambient tire noise and honking, making it more pleasant for people with sensory issues to move around outside. Noise-cancelling headphones may not be as necessary. Visually impaired people would not be subjected to victim-blaming tips like \"watch for turning drivers\", when they often literally *cannot* watch for them, as there would be more emphasis on driver caution, and better prophylactic street safety features, instead of pedestrian caution.\n\nThe logistics of driving for people with disabilities will **also** improve. In a less car-dependent place, someone with a disability will not need to compete with able-bodied people over parking, and thus, they (or the person driving them) won't need to stress out about it. Parking will be easier to find. Since there will be less drivers on the road, there will be a lower chance of someone parking in the disabled parking spot at businesses when they shouldn't have.\n\nIt's just **less stressful.** There will be less hypotheticals, and less contingency planning that needs to be done in the realm of transporting oneself. To me, this feels liberating. Due to my disabilities, I always need to think three steps ahead to plan for unexpected things. Car dependence adds another layer of \"what if\" to that. Finding a parking spot, timed parking limits, payment, accidents on the way (I have been rear-ended in standstill traffic before), etc.\n\nThis isn't the only thing car dependence adds in a negative way.\n\nAs someone with disabilities, I feel that my life and daily activities are restricted by default, simply by merit of my disability existing. Proponents of car dependence are not allies. And they are not doing people with disabilities any favours by insisting that car dependence, aka the continued neglect of our **personal choice** on how to transport ourselves around, is the way forward. That just adds additional restrictions. It removes an element of agency that doesn't need to be absent in the first place. That isn't right.\n\nThere needs to be a choice at minimum. Right now, there isn't a choice in far, far too many places.\n\n**All of that said:**\n\nI do have concerns and fears about accessible city implementation, as do others. These concerns are not unfounded. New infrastructure can completely miss the mark on ADA/ADA compliance. Buses can lack air conditioning (this is a **major** issue for me in Vancouver). Many older buildings are walkups and do not have lifts, making them inaccessible to people who use mobility devices. Some public transport centers do not have elevators within reasonable distance to stairs, forcing people with mobility devices to detour extensively, soaking up time. Many bus stops lack both shelter/shade and benches, so I need to sit on the ground. And I am constantly bothered by how few public washrooms there are for people with gastrointestinal issues. It is degrading to need to enter a random Starbucks and silently head to the washroom, because the duty of providing such a basic amenity has been shunted off to nearby businesses (usually because a municipality refuses to fund the regular maintenance of facilities like this).\n\n**However,** these implementation problems do not make the notion of an accessible/walkable city inherently ableist in itself. The problem is with the **implementation** and the allocation of resources toward fixing the flaws, not the concept. It is manipulative to insist the opposite is true, and therefore that accessible/walkable cities should not exist.\n\nI will not say, \"but the buses are unbearably hot, therefore, I hate accessible/walkable cities\".\n\nI will say, \"fix the fucking buses, I have places to go without a car\".",

There's a lot of accidents because they can afford to be irresponsible. We can't though, we live with family and have one car. Yet nobody seems to understand that my family can't just *get* me a car. They understand even less that I literally *can't* because my vision doesn't meet the safety standard. I'm sick of being trapped in my house. I wish there was a way I could get around that doesn't actively put myself and others in danger while polluting the environment.

      "text": "Saw a conversation on here about how cars, when idling, are very efficient and don't use a lot of fuel. Knowing that, maybe some would say that it's okay to leave your car idling in the winter.\n\nProblems with cars don't just come from fuel consumption. It's also about emissions -- and not just CO2 and climate change.\n\nI want to tell you all a story from when I was younger.\n\nAround 4 years ago, I went to a small music festival out in the woods. Middle of nowhere. The air out there is as clean as it gets unless you're willing to do some hardcore hiking. People drive their cars out to this big empty field surrounded by trees, and then they turn their cars off. Generators are banned except by the festival crew for running sound systems and lights.\n\nAll that to say, there are basically no engines running out there.\n\nThat time of year, it gets cold at night. My partner and I did some LSD and smoked some weed. Weed makes your body temperature drop, so we were freezing our butts off. LSD makes you notice all kinds of stuff you wouldn't normally notice, like smells.\n\nWe decide to go sit in the car and run the heater for a little bit, just so we can get a break from the cold. We're sitting in there nice and comfortable. I need to... I don't know, brush my teeth or something, so I get out of the car.\n\nRight away, I'm hit by the smell of exhaust. Our one car idling in this field is making the air all around us smell like shit. Thank god none of our neighbors were home, or else I would have felt bad about polluting their space. Our car was just one car. Imagine if all of them were running. Imagine a whole city of cars.\n\nIt's the kind of thing you don't notice, normally. You get used to that smell, in the city. If I was sober, I probably would have ignored it completely. It would have just been normal. But I didn't tune it out, then.\n\nEver since, I smell it. I've never allowed myself to be desensitized again. Some roads smell worse than others. Sometimes when I'm on the freeway, I can tell the difference between the smells of different cars.\n\nThat smell isn't just unpleasant. It's not just a quality of life issue.\n\nThat smell is giving people cancer.\n\nDon't let your cars sit and idle.",

      "text": "I know this is probably low on the list of harms that cars do to society compared to things like injury, deaths, and pollution, but it is the little s\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* cherry on top of the car-centered society we live in.  \n\nHow many times have you had an experience while walking or cycling where a passing car purposely revs its engine or honks or yells something at you as it passes by solely to startle, annoy, or bully you? Now think of how many times a fellow pedestrian or cyclist has yelled something at you as they passed you on the sidewalk/street. I know the latter *has* happened to me before, but I am struggling to remember specific instances. It just doesn't happen anywhere near as much as it does with cars. I mean today alone while riding my bike around town for a couple hours I had at least 2 cars purposely revving their engines as they passed me to try and get some reaction from me. This is a pretty typical experience for me as a cyclist.\n\nThis isn't the only example of anti-social behavior cars enable either. Think of how many people one idiot with a modified exhaust can annoy while driving around on a daily basis. Hundreds? Thousands? Even other people in cars are subject to this behavior. Think of how many times you have been cut off by another driver or had a driver cut in line while you were waiting to take an exit or enter a congested area. Compare that to how often someone cuts in line at the grocery store checkout and you get a sense of just how anti-social people become when they are in a car. \n\nI think there are two major contributors to the anti-social nature of cars. Firstly, cars give people anonymity. Small, tinted windows and high rate of speed make it difficult to identify the driver of the car to anyone on the outside. Secondly, cars give people powers that they wouldn't otherwise have - the power to very quickly leave the scene of a confrontation or crime and the power to intimidate with their sheer size and loud engine/exhaust/horn. These two things combined make it all too easy for people to become entitled, self-centered a-holes when they get into a car.\n\nA world with fewer people driving around in cars would be a more friendly and pleasant world to live in and the benefits to the everyday person's mood and sense of community should not be underestimated.\n\nPlease remember to be kind when you get behind the wheel of a car.

      "text": "99% of American pickup truck drivers are dumb, insecure, annoying losers. Especially in Arizona which is the #1 ranked state for road rage and road rage shootings. They are dangerous, pea brained, neanderthals who think they are alpha males. Trucks statistically hold the record for the most accidents per year on the road. That says all you need to know. These people are like the bullies in high school who picked on the handicapped kid. Trucks are also a huge unnecessary source of diesel and noise pollution, get terrible mileage and they try to bully and intimidate other cars and riders on the road. Aside from towing big piles of dirt and rocks they need to drive a big loud truck so that they feel more powerful and dominant than everyone else. That is the textbook definition of insecurity. In addition to being loud, smelly and obnoxious, their annoying high beams are always bothering other drivers b/c the car is so high off the ground. If you notice they will get road rage at the smallest things and try to intimidate other drivers due to their low IQ, EI and overly high testosterone levels. It's no coincidence when you picture a typical truck driver you think of someone in jail, not a civilized, educated, clean cut responsible individual trying to help save the planet. For further proof just lookup \"truck road rage\" on Youtube for hours of laughs.",

      "text": "I was waiting at a red light, earbuds in, podcast playing, with a full load of groceries in the back, obeying the road rules and driving safely, when a middle aged woman approached me. Now, this is peculiar, because I was in the middle of the street, we were surrounded by cars, and here was someone walking in traffic to have a chin wag. Well, I take out one earbud, but leave the podcast playing because using your phone while driving is dangerous, so I have no access to the pause button. \n\nI manage to hear, \"something something bike lane\", and she's pointing at the bike lane immediately to my left. So, I kindly inform her that that bike lane does not exist on the other side of the traffic lights. This is relevant, because, if I were to use the bike lane, I would be forced to merge with accelerating traffic not 20 meters down the road, while still trying to pedal up to speed. This, of course, would be extremely detrimental to my immediate health, and is how I broke my arm last year. In response to this information, the woman says something I can't hear which seems to be a complaint regarding my safety. She walks behind me and presumably back to her car. I do not turn around because I'm too busy watching the lights to make sure I accelerate with the proper flow of traffic when they turn green. I have no idea why there is a woman walking on her legs through traffic at this moment. \n\nNow, I find it odd that she would complain about my safety, because it is her car which threatens to run me over, and which presumably she is worried about. Not to worry, the law clearly states not to run cyclists over at traffic lights, so there is no need to worry about that. However, were I follow her advice, I would have geniune cause to worry about this woman prematurely ending my life. But perhaps this sort of deadly advice is normal from people who walk in traffic. \n\nThankfully, I was able to accelerate safely as usual and get home with my groceries. However, I was not able to escape the exacerbating effect the particulate emissions had on my allergies, and the carcinogenic effect they likely had on my lungs. While ignoring this insane woman kept me safe from immediate death, her choice to drive a car has endangered my life nonetheless. As it endangers the life of every child who breathes in the pollution from her car.\n\nFuck every driver on that road, but fuck that woman in particular.",

Our current limit of 80 kmh (50 mph) is unsafe and results in enormous death toll. Fines are laughable, less that $7 for 40 kmh (25 mph) above the limit, so they encourage drivers to break it.\n\nImagine what kind of reaction I got? He said that the person who proposed it is insane and needs to be executed by shooting squad! (He's kinda Stalin fanboy). He's like, drivers are contributing good to the society by getting around quickly and solving stuff so they should be privileged, not discriminated. He said that experienced drivers like him don't need rules and never make mistakes like hitting pedestrians! Also he noted that fines and parking fees are already ridiculously high and the government is taking last piece of bread from motorists.\n\nWell, if driving a 2 ton ~~death machine~~ pickup truck through the city centre is contributing, then why taking metro is not, I asked. At this point he was already at the limit, so when he saw that the deputy has a rainbow flag at her desk he just lost it... Lmao, but not funny. It's actually super sad. Fuck cars\n\nPS. Our apartment is just above a massive flyover 12 lanes in total. As you might expect, my father absolutely hates it! He acknowledges that it pollutes air, spreads dust and dirt, is noisy and unaesthetic. Because of that, he wants us to move to a new suburban district where it's more quiet and the air is not so toxic! Not to replace the highway inside a city with a tram, but to just run from the issue and make someone else deal with traffic he's going to create by living in the suburb.

      "text": "It was about midnight at a house party in suburban London, and people are saying their goodbyes. The host asked us all how we're getting home, and everyone was getting picked up, either by their parents or in an Uber. I felt slightly sad at this: they would be taking the bus home if it wasn't so late, and them potentially vulnerable to any strange people on it, so maybe this was the best option for them. \n\nNow, I'd brought my bike. (I'd asked beforehand whether I could leave it anywhere in their house, and I could.) So I just decided to simply get on it, and go home.\n\nIt was then I realised what an advantage I had. Everyone else was sat there waiting for a ride, some complaining about the cost of Ubers, some others even lamenting the fact that they had to use a polluting vehicle to get home.\n\nI left exactly when I wanted, no waiting at all. It was completely free: not a single penny was spent to get me home. No carbon emissions came out of my vehicle. I didn't have to rely on anyone else at all: I was completely independent. What's more, it was a nice clear night, and I got a lot of thinking time to myself, and also a great deal of exercise. (I'm quite chubby, and it was 7.5km, often uphill.) Plus, it's just good bloody fun.\n\nNo cost, pollution, reliance on anyone else, creepy people, or waiting times. The bike is truly the best way to get around anywhere, and everyone who can do it, should. I think everyone I know has a bike, and it's baffling to me why they don't use it.",

      "text": "I moved to the US from Germany almost a decade ago. My home country is famously known as a \"car nation\", so I am still quite shocked at how much more prevalent car culture is in the US.(Public transit in Germany is actually quite good even though we love to complain about it)\n\nRecently, I stumbled over a discussion about speed cameras in California. People kept saying how such cameras are just there to generate money and to screw over \"the little guy.\" It also gave me the impression that people view speed limits as a suggestion and not the maximum speed they are allowed to drive.\n\nSure there are some cases where speed limits are too low but often cities lower speed limits because a street has seen a large number of accidents or there is a lot of pedestrian or bike traffic.Lower speed limits can also help reduce air and noise pollution, and CO2 emissions...\n\nThat got me thinking that in the US it is very common to go at least 10mph over the limit. If you do not, people will start tailgating you or worse.   the Speeding penalties in the US are also pretty low unless you speed in a construction or school zone.  \n\n\nAs someone who does not own a car and does most of their trips with an e-bike, I am always happy about lower limits that let me flow with the traffic. Sadly, people will still try to pass you if you go 22 on a 20mph road.\n\nWhy is it so hard here to just follow the posted limit? Traffic fatalities here are so much higher than in Germany and no doubt speeding is one of the major reasons for this.Why do car brains think enforcing speed limit is a rip-off when the limits are on a giant sign and all you have to do is follow them?",

      "text": "One of the great ironies of National Parks in North America, namely in Canada and the US is that they're only reliably accessible by personal automobile. I shouldn't have to tell you how terrible cars are for animals and the environment. There's the direct consequences like collisions (roadkill), road noise, tire particles, constant traffic, habitat loss resulting from just how much space cars, roads, highways, and parking lots take up. \n\nCars kill thousands of people each year, and millions of animals, if it's unsafe for people to cross a highway, it's definitely unsafe for animals to cross. Even though some of the highways crossing through forests have these wildlife crossing bridges, these bridges wouldn't have to exist if it weren't for cars and highways cutting the forest in half!\n\n[This wouldn't need to exist if it weren't for cars!](https://preview.redd.it/n58xou3vzjad1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e25d71d8079d66cd8829efa3acb3e9a7e4d53a4)\n\nThen there's the indirect consequences like air pollution both local and global, cars encouraging sprawling suburbs, mining and extracting resources like oil, metal, etc for the production and maintenance of cars, imperialism, invasions, and wars for said resources \\*cough\\* \\*cough\\* US invasion of Iraq, exploitative labor practices and literal child slaves for lithium mining for battery electrics cars! I could go on about how terrible cars are both physically, environmentally, and socially, but I'll focus on the irony on how many National Parks are only accessible by car.\n\nIt's ironic how the only way to \"experience true nature\" is for someone to hop into a usually gas-guzzling car, drive it down a highway that cuts the forest in half, only to [mow down a rare white brown bear and her cubs in the process](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/). Needless to say, f\\*ck cars, and especially f\\*ck them if they're used to drive through a National Park. And the gall of calling these parks \"protected lands\" while allowing cars to drive through them?! If you want to protect land, prohibit cars from driving there!\n\nOne of the biggest threats facing animals in natural areas isn't human hunters, poachers, or invasive species, but cars! Cars both directly and indirectly are the biggest killers of animals, and it's a shame that most National Parks are only accessible by cars, the biggest threat to animals.\n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks)\n\n[https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367](https://theconversation.com/10-million-animals-die-on-our-roads-each-year-heres-what-works-and-what-doesnt-to-cut-the-toll-222367)\n\nI'm not saying that there shouldn't be parks for people to visit as people just walking on trails and such do not greatly disturb wildlife. However, driving there in a car shouldn't be the only option if an option at all. \n\nWhile there are unfortunately collisions between trains on ground level tracks and animals, the number of \"roadkill\" is significantly lower than with cars and measures can be taken to prevent this. As to why train collisions with animals are lower? Firstly, railway tracks do not take up a lot of space compared to a highway. All you need for a railway to be efficient is a double track, and even with larger North American loading gauges, at most all you need is about 7.5 meters width, the equivalent of two highways lanes (correct me if I'm wrong about North American train loading gauges).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kemivdb9ckad1.jpg?width=509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ec593632f618091cb65e04c75c7076bc78b5e8\n\nSecondly, even a frequent railway line with trains every ten minutes is nowhere near the constant, never-ending traffic of a highway. With trains every ten minutes or longer, it allows for animals to cross.\n\nAnd thirdly, it seems like animals are just better adapted around trains than with cars. Rather than worrying about dozens of cars when trying to cross a highway, they only have to deal with one train on tracks that take up less space, meaning there's lower risk when crossing. We've all seen birds and such hang out around train tracks without issue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbdkl9liakad1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b99d181006d8cbcf13c7ee5e21f2c7e0c257e46\n\nNow, in the unfortunately [story with the rare white brown bear](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rare-white-grizzly-bear-2-cubs-killed-yoho-national-park-canada/), if I read the article correctly, the mother was grazing in the ditch near the train tracks. Now when the metal wheels screeched against the rails, it startled her, I mean who wouldn't get startled by train wheels screeching, I would as trains are relatively quiet except for wheel screech. The startled mother bear unfortunately ran up from the ditch and onto the highway where she was struck and killed.\n\n\"It's the train that scared her onto the highway! If it weren't for the train, she wouldn't have gotten struck!\" A car brain would say. Keep in mind that the bear knew to stay off the train tracks, and that it was the car that made the killing blow. If the highway wasn't there and the bear did got startled, she would've gone back to the ditch and continue on grazing. Not to mention cars kill animals regardless if there's a train track nearby or not. The train didn't kill her, the cars did!\n\nNow, one way to mitigate the impacts that railways have in an forested area, at least once construction is complete is to have the tracks elevated on viaducts as it allows for the train to be fully grade separated while allowing for animals to cross underneath.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4htsj1agakad1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a6cd178cbbf672fd3d4dc89d8d9a0c5197fed3\n\nWhile all human activity does impact wildlife, having elevated railways probably has the lowest impact as once construction is complete, it doesn't cut the forest in half like a surface highway for the elevated tracks allows for animals to cross beneath it safely without having to worry about getting struck.\n\nIt's a shame that most National Parks in North America are only accessible by car, the worst mode of transport for animals' wellbeing due to how many animals cars kill. To preserve our National Parks, we have to restrict cars from entering them due to said negative effects. At best, have elevate trains to them. At the bear minimum, use buses that can take a good 50-100 cars off the road.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yko469ebbkad1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc60d6a7661254b040e5f360fed1bae291a08283\n\nBy limiting and/or prohibiting cars from driving through National Parks can we preserve and truly enjoy the wonders of the natural world.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uhyaujlbkad1.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c06d21a44a3e5a9f173e3781fe668a9fa32b7ba\n\n",

      "text": "A suggestion for everyone. After many attempts of trying to convey the idea that it would be good to have less cars in cities I learned a few things.\n\n1) No one really gives a fuck about pollution being particular matter or CO2 emissions. Those are problems that people that live it and breath it simply don't see because it doesn't affect them immediately. It's not a virus that might kill you in days. You'll never get attention for modal switch arguments by saying \"drive less because it pollutes\", you'll just be laughed at  \n2) Talking about road safety doesn't work either. People that use the car for everything they do and can't image a day without it, won't simply understand the meaning of lower speeds to save lives or noise pollution or what have you. They will complain to other drivers being too fast or not stopping at crosswalks when they are pedestrians BUT they'll do the same when driving without even realizing it because they're just used to it. When you're in a car your idea of safety and speed is completely different. Talking about road deaths doesn't work either. If it doesn't affect them directly they simply don't see them as people.  \n3) **instead insist on reinforcing the idea of livable spaces** making comparison to experienced walks they enjoyed. Everybody likes urban spaces where there are no cars, it's a human \"need\". Walking in plazas and historic center without cars and remind them how \"good it is to walk\" in those places and how nobody would ever go back to have cars there, it would be just unimaginable. Also we never go for a walk near traffic (this is Europe biased but I'm sure in the US there are some examples)  \n4) **avoid causing division** like \"you drivers\" \"us bikers\". It'll never work and just reinforces their bias. I participated in a workshop about cycling cities in Italy and this researcher talked about how our thoughts are just constructs that will never break and it's useless to try.  \nDon't use \"cyclists\" or \"drives\" that create conflict. We're all people that want to get back home alive. Use \"citizens\", \"people\", \"parents\", \"newyorkers\", categories that include everyone.  \nThe car is and will ever be a synonym of freedom and speed. Don't try to use sentences like \"cycling is faster\" or \"cycling gives you freedom\". How would someone that never cycled understand this? Instead use something like \"when cycling you can decide how fast you can go. When you're in a hurry you can cycle faster, when you're not you can go slower and enjoy the view or stop at your favorite store or take a picture.\" The target shouldn't be arriving faster but arriving better.",

      "text": "When I read arguers on this sub, 90% of them are reacting to the perceived extremism of the movement. They see that it's Fuck Cars and they think, \"but how would I do without a car in XYZ situation without a car?\" and they get you into a rabbit hole about solving some technical problem that would occur if we removed all cars from the road.\n\nStop yourself from getting into that conversation.\n\nThe most important part of the anti-car movement is this: A little bit of a good thing *is still good.*\n\nWe don't need to argue about how a 100% car-free would work. Maybe it won't work. Whatever. That's just a hypothetical world right now.\n\nPro-car people know that cars are dangerous, they pollute, they take up space, they are inefficient and expensive and force our cities into sprawl and prevent small businesses. These are facts. So instead of arguing about how to remove *all* cars, emphasize these facts and ask them to try to remove *one* car from the road.\n\nDoes your family own 3 cars? Could you maybe do without one? Could you carpool more often instead of each person taking their own? Maybe one person could take the bike sometimes? Most families could do with 2 instead of 3.\n\nDo you commute with a big truck? Could you maybe drive a smaller car instead? What about a moped?\n\nLet's talk about adding bike lanes in your city. Let's talk about expanding sidewalks. Let's slow down traffic along main street so walking is safer and more pleasant. Let's make as much progress as we can.\n\n\"But what about rural areas?\" Doesn't matter. Maybe we can only remove cars from cities. That would be a HUGE success. Focus on that. But maybe your small town could be accessed by bike instead of car? Wouldn't your small town main street be better if it was walkable?\n\n\"But what about trucking?\" Doesn't matter. Maybe hauling cargo by truck is irreplaceable. Even if all we did was remove personal vehicles it would be a huge success. But could we do *more* cargo by train instead?\n\n\"But I hang sheetrock for my job so I need a truck!\" Ok, fine. But the vast majority of people don't, so let's get those people using trains and bikes and you can keep your truck.\n\nIf you are coming onto this sub to argue, you need to address the main point, the main problem: our roads and streets in North America are designed for the car and for the car only, and people are given no choice but to drive for transportation. Cars fill our public places. They are dangerous, unhealthy, expensive, destructive to the environment, and they force themselves into our lives.\n\nThe majority of people in Europe and America live in or adjacent to a city, commute a few miles every day, go grocery shopping a few miles every day, all by car. The vast majority of this travel could be replaced by biking and transit *if our world was designed better.* If we build locations close to where people live, build great transit and bike infrastructure, and allowed more dense housing and commercial buildings, this would work for the vast majority of humans and would remove the need for the vast majority of driving.\n\nIf you're here to argue, then address the main argument, not century-later hypotheticals. Explain why you think it's good that the majority of people drive to work and live far away from their jobs and their grocery stores, and public transit is poorly maintained or non-existent. Talk about the expense of car infrastructure, automobile deaths, traffic, and parking.\n\nFor the fuckcars supporters, keep on talking about how to make that perfect 100% car-free world. But don't let perfect be the enemy of good.",

      "text": "1. Drunk driving, more people with the ability to walk, take a bus or another form of transport will greatly help solve the problem.\n2. Obesity and overall physical health, more people walking to destinations or bus stops or train stations is more calories expended while also getting rid of drive thrus would encourage people to walk to restaurants that they would normally drive to\n3. Economy boost, more walking = more time spent in a city/town making people wanting to stop at a corner store to get food or something else like clothing at a store nearby.\n4. Mental health, because of the ability to walk more places and not having to rely on cars as sole form of transport people don't need to stress in traffic and get benefits of exercise through increase in walking.\n5. Help slow climate change and improve pollution, by encouraging better alternatives to driving, much less pollutants will be exhausted into the atmosphere and will lead to cleaner air reulting in better physical health and possibly help slow climate change.\n6. More cash in your pocket, the average American will spend around 450.000$ on owning and maintaining a car which is absolute insanity also gas prices are getting higher and so is inflation so this number will only increase. \n7. Better community, more people walking about in their neighborhoods and towns, this will lead to people being more social and build a stronger community which will also improve mental health\n8. More jobs, \"oh but car manufacturing is such a big part of the economy\" buses and trains exist, they also need to be manufactured as well as maintained so the jobs aren't going anywhere. Cars, vans, and trucks still have a very worthy place in the modern world so they'd still have to be maintained and manufactured.\n9. Also speaking of jobs, pro human infrastructure gives people who can't afford a car or simply don't want to drive more opportunities to work and make money further boosting the economy.\n10. Efficient land use and better national connection,\nBuilding more dense and compact housing with mixed use areas instead of having it so ridiculously far spread out will improve land use in a better logical way instead of wasting it for parking and excessively wide roads. Also building a high quality national railway like America used to have and was built upon will greatly improve the connection in the country letting people travel throughout in a comfortable, affordable way.\n11. Back to more cash in pocket, people have more money to spend on useful things such as food, rent or whatever else while also leaving extra cash to the side which will also boost the economy.\n12. Possibility for better looking cities and towns in which people actually want to spend time in which can also boost economy and mental health. Since America was starting to be built around cars, the buildings became bland and boring boxes which people are forced to drive to. Online shopping is sharply increasing in America which is killing off the big box stores and malls. While in many European countries, physical shopping is just as popular as online shopping. This is because of the high walkability and convenience of shopping in the European countries. Also the rich architecture really attracts people to the cities and makes people want to walk through them and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nCame up with this list on the spot because of how \nfed up I am with American car centric nonsense. Feel free to add to the list. This is all from the top of my head.\n",

      "text": "I'm a music teacher, teaching piano, guitar, bass, and drumkit lessons with kids ages 7-18. I usually start my lessons with a couple minutes of shooting the breeze: it's fun for me, plus it sets the tone of a nice, low-stress environment to learn in. Sometimes it leads to interesting conversations.\n\nFirst was a 9yo boy I've had as a student for a few months now. He asks me why I'm wearing running shoes and shorts when it's like 45 degrees F/8 degrees C outside.\n\nI tell him I live about three miles away and usually run to work, and sometimes bike when I'm not feeling up to running, and that running really warms you up.\n\nHe asks why I run to work.\n\nI say because I don't like cars.\n\nHe asks if I have a car. I say no.\n\nHe looks at me like I've just grown another head. What do you mean, you don't have a car? How do you get to places?\n\nI say, well, I told you already, on foot or by bike. Sometimes I take the train.\n\nHe's still flabbergasted. Why don't you have a car?\n\nBecause they're loud, expensive, polluting, space-inefficient, and dangerous.\n\nHe confidently says that cars aren't dangerous. He's in the car all the time and has never gotten in an accident. I say, yeah, you haven't, but something like 40,000 people die in car accidents in the US every year. Plus I was hit by a car a few years ago on my bike.\n\nHe's stunned. That happens?\n\nSimple, I said. The car ran a red light. I was lucky that it only hit my bike: I could have lost my left leg, but as it was I was just thrown into the air and walked away with scrapes and bruises.\n\nHe asks if the bike was damaged. Well, yeah, it was in bits. No way to salvage it. I bet its remains are still in the attic of that shop in Santa Cruz I took it to the next day.\n\nHe asks if my parents were mad that I broke the bike. I said, of course not, they were just glad I was OK. Anyway, as much as I enjoy talking about this subject, let's play some guitar.\n\n***\n\nSecond was a 13yo boy who I've been teaching for over a year. The conversation started in much the same way: asked about my being underdressed for the weather, I say I run or bike to work, etc. He asks why I don't like cars and I give him the same response as above.\n\nHe says, well, electric cars answer two of those things, they're quiet and they don't pollute.\n\nI say it's not quite as simple as that. Yes, the cars themselves don't pollute, but-- he interrupts, yeah, the energy generation is still dirty, that's true.\n\nI say, yes, if they're plugged into a dirty grid. If the energy to power them is generated sustainably, i.e. solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or debatably nuclear, then that solves that, but the bigger issue is their manufacture.\n\nHe says, yeah, they're powered by lithium batteries, right?\n\nYes, but that's not all that's in the batteries. They contain a variety of heavy and rare-earth metals, all of which have enormous extraction costs. You could build... I don't have exact numbers off the top of my head, but dozens if not hundreds of bicycles for the same resource cost as one Tesla.\n\nHe's surprised. That's a lot of bikes.\n\nI say yeah. As for loud, it turns out that even for most gas-powered cars, over about 15mph, most of what you're hearing outside the car isn't engine noise, it's tire noise. I saw a comparison: this guy in the Netherlands went to a street with a decibel measurer, I forget the technical term for it, to see how loud various vehicles are. Pedestrians barely registered, bikes made some noise, electric cars and gas cars both made a lot of noise. Only motorcycles and buses made more, but buses get a pass because one bus can take the place of dozens of cars (I am of course referring to the Not Just Bikes video). Anyway, I enjoy this subject a lot, but we really should play some keys.\n\nHe says, wow, I didn't know that. I'm going to have to look into this.\n\nHe's a smart kid.\n\n***\n\nI do so enjoy corrupting the youth.",

      "text": "Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:\n\n**\u001cMy emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.\u001d**\n\nThis is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth\u0019s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t afford an electric car.\u001d**\n\nNo one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There\u0019s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.\u001d**\n\nYou *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dDriving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nCommute times should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cThere\u0019s no infrastructure to bike where I live.\u001d**\n\nAny road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThe infrastructure isn\u0019t ready yet.\u001d**\n\nWe don\u0019t have time: not only is our planet\u0019s climate destabilizing, it\u0019s destabilizing quickly. We can\u0019t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it\u0019s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.\n\n**\u001cMy workplace is out of reach of biking distance.\u001d**\n\nConsider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can\u0019t, then consider finding another job that\u0019s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn\u0019t be the priority when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI\u0019m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.\u001d**\n\nUnless you\u0019re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t carry my groceries on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThere\u0019s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI can\u0019t ride a bike in the cold.\u001d**\n\nWear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cNot everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.\u001d**\n\nThen go for an adult tricycle instead. Don\u0019t set that option aside so quickly when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dThere wouldn\u0019t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.\u001d**\n\nIf more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet\u0019s climate from destabilizing.\n\n**\u001cI don\u0019t like waiting for the bus.\u001d**\n\nBring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dI don\u0019t like how crowded mass public transit is.\u001d**\n\nComfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet\u0019s climate is destabilizing.\n\n**\u001dHow can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?\u001d**\n\nAre you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?\n\n**\u001dYour use of a device that\u0019s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we\u0019re focusing on.\n\n**\u001d[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.\u001d**\n\nThis doesn\u0019t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You\u0019re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.\n\nThe bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren\u0019t insignificant at all. You can\u0019t shift the blame on \u001ccorporations\u001d or \u001cinfrastructure\u001d when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.\n\nEDITS:\n\nIt turns out r/fuckcars has *way* more car apologists hiding among its members than one would expect!\n\nDrinking game!

      "text": "YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaQUhAOdtk\n\nPersonally, it feels like it skipped over the problem of having \"5% of developed land\" be half empty parking lots. Solar seems like it would be significantly easier to just install on roof tops; it's just prohibitively expensive for individual homeowners to invest in. Things like the upfront cost (I've heard $20k to $30k tossed around, probably varies too based on location and State/Federal incentives), issues when selling your home if they're not paid upfront, and difficulty getting loans for them. But larger condo/apartment buildings could more easily handle that cost, and replace these vast empty parking lots. They're also more efficient than Single Family Homes (SFHs), and they'd remove a lot of the need for cars in the first place since everything would be spaced closer together. Cutting down on that 5% of land being empty parking lots seems like the bigger issue. Trying to cramp solar onto that space seems like a bad bandaid type solution. It reminds me of carbrains thinking that an electric car magically removes the issues with cars. It doesn't - it removes _some_ of the pollution, but if we continue to build electric car infrastructure like how we built gas car infrastructure (highways, car centric suburbs, large parking lots/requirements, etc) then we still have a car centric problem that won't be solve.\n\nThe only thing is maybe when we cut down parking lots to their bare minimums, since I don't know if we can ever truly remove _all_ cars, then maybe it makes sense to use solar panels as covers for them. Might be easier then - parking would cost a lot more, giving the parking lot owners more incentive / income to cover them with solar, and then solar would give them some passive income in addition to the higher cost parking. Just dumping solar on every Walmart Supercenter parking lot though... why. Replace the Walmart with a mix used Walmart. Same with other big box stores too that might want to adopt this. Make the zoning easier, make the approval process straightforward, and remove some of the NIMBY inputs. Remove the requirement for 500 parking spots and then the space for an apartment building or similar housing is available.\n\nThoughts?",

      "title": "So You Want To Fuck Cars: How to lobby local politicians to reduce vehicle impact (text post)",
      "text": "*Everything mentioned in this post will cost you $0 and will take a max of 2 hours of your time total*\n\nHey guys, I\u0019m Beli_Mawrr, Sacramento, CA resident and local purveyor of anti-car fuckery. \n\nAfter weeks of watching NJB, CityBeautiful, RMTransit, and other urbanism-related youtube channels until my eyes turned into beautiful octagon-shaped superblocks, I realized there\u0019s one main thread missing from them all: Effective Activism.  What I mean is that while they\u0019re highly persuasive on WHY you\u0019d want this kind of low-car, walkable, healthy neighborhood, they\u0019re not big on HOW to achieve it. That\u0019s a gap I hope to mitigate with this post.\n\nTo clarify: Lobby means to influence. So when I say \u001cLobby\u001d I mean \u001cAttempt to persuade your representatives of something\u001d. This post will be primarily about how to lobby your local politician, but if persuaded I may make a post about attending city council meetings.\n\nLet\u0019s start with the basics.. First of all, it\u0019s important to remember most of the problems we face are on the local and at best state level. A city\u0019s zoning code is not going to be something the federal government cares about. If you\u0019ve ever dealt with trying to get anything out of the federal government, you know it\u0019s very hard to manage, get ahold of your representatives, and so on. But there\u0019s better news: In my experience, the smaller the polity, the easier it is to influence. Local politicians are ALWAYS hungry to meet people. They want your opinion; they rely on it. So that\u0019s the first thing to remember: *You* ***can*** *lobby your local government with no money.*\n\nSo, how do you do this? The first step is finding the names of your local politicians. For me, in Sacramento, this was a matter of finding the district map, finding which district I resided in, finding the wrong district, and looking up the wrong politician. But that\u0019s a story for another time. So now you should have the name of your district; now look up the politician representing that district to get their name.\n\nWhen you have their name, look up their voting history, their campaign platforms, what they likely care about. That\u0019s your basis. Then immediately schedule a meeting with them. In my town, my politician had an assistant who was assigned to make meetings for them. I emailed that assistant and said \u001cI\u0019d like to schedule a meeting with councilmember (X) about the city\u0019s bicycle infrastructure\u001d. Sacramento has about a million residents and they scheduled a meeting for the next week. That\u0019s how hungry they are for our opinions. **IF NOT THOUGH, EMAIL THEM TWICE WEEKLY UNTIL THEY ANSWER YOU**\n\nIt\u0019s important to keep your point short and limited to begin with. You want to keep that initial email short and to the point. If you have a laundry list of demands, like we do, we should really be forming local city wide orgs, but that\u0019s a subject for another post. I kept my points to bicycle infrastructure for now. \n\nA talking point is a short quote or argument that will help persuade. You can say these verbatim or simply paraphrase, but they\u0019re your central arguments.\n\nSo while you\u0019re in dialogue, finding a meeting time with your politician, etc, it\u0019s time to look up and lock into your talking points. They\u0019re going to be different for each politician you talk to but in general, keep them short, simple, and most of all, inarguable. This is easy for us because urbanism is very easy to argue, most people don\u0019t even have any idea why things are the way they are.\n\nIf you\u0019re talking to a liberal, left-leaning politician who wants to get rid of poverty and homelessness, congrats, they\u0019re probably on the level already, but here are a few of the talking points you\u0019ll want. Be aware that you\u0019ll probably need to tune these for the individual politician:\n\n * Bikes are inherently safer\n\n * A bicycle is affordable especially to the less privileged\n\n * Cars pollute\n\n * Biking is healthier\n\n * Cars take up space\n\n * More bikes will mean less traffic\n\n * Bikes are much quieter\n\n * Density means less homelessness\n\nSome for the more technical city planners and such:\n\n * Bikes have much higher throughput\n\n * Biking infra is cheap and easily repairable compared to car infra\n\n * Density saves the city money\n\n * Mixed usage means more tax revenue\n\nSome for a politician scared of NIMBYs: \n\n * Good bike infra means safety for your kids\n\n * You want it to be safe to exercise\n\n * Bike infra is quiet \n\n * It will dramatically increase the value of your home: see NJB\u0019s latest video for talking points/examples.\n\n * You can\u0019t run away from crimes on a bike, so it will help lower crime\n\nOk, so I strayed more into some mixed usage arguments there but you get the picture.\n\nSo when you have your talking points, write them all down on a piece of paper, or type it up and print it. You want a physical copy. Gather facts about your city next. What are the VMT? (Vehicle miles travelled) per mode? How many miles of roads does your city have? What is the average cost of construction for what you want? For me, the latter was easy: It\u0019s just some concrete and paint. \n\nBut be ready with the prices, because a lot of politicians will try that: \nThem: Oh but Beli_mawrr, it\u0019s so expensive! \nYou: Didn\u0019t the city spend X on repairing Y road last year? Councilmember, we\u0019re not asking for much, it\u0019s just some paint and concrete. \n\nYou\u0019ll next want to make a concrete list of what you want. We want Dutch junctions on XYZ roads and 30 miles of bike infra. It will cost the city approx Y. Can we get that in the budget for next year? Why not.\n\nWhen you have all that done, it\u0019s time to write this down. Don\u0019t write a speech. It\u0019s tempting, but it\u0019s counterproductive. You\u0019re in a 1-on-1 with the politician, you don\u0019t want to be speeching at them. Write down your facts, what you want, and how much it\u0019ll cost. Bullet points, not paragraphs. \n\nWhen all that\u0019s done, you\u0019ll print it out. Ask a friend to \u001cWar game\u001d with you. Have them be the angry politician who hates you and everything you stand for and who\u0019s willing to use dirty underhanded ad hominems and so on. Try to persuade your bad politician friend to invest in bike infra. When you\u0019re comfortable with that, you\u0019re ready for your meeting.\n\nIn the meeting, you\u0019re trying to have a dialogue. You bring something up, you pause and let the politician comment. If they push back, have a light-hearted discussion about it, and then circle back to your next talking point or demand. They ultimately work for you, so they know that in order to secure your vote, they have to more or less agree with you. It\u0019s easy. At worst, it\u0019s like talking to your dad who loves his car and doesn\u0019t want to ride a gay communist bike.\n\nHowever, it may be the case that you politician is vibing with you HARD. They\u0019re like YASSSSS SLAY whenever you say a talking point. If that\u0019s the case, there\u0019s no need for you to persuade them. Instead, pivot to asking them why it isn\u0019t already like this. They\u0019ll say \u001cOh I\u0019m a minority on the city council\u001d or something, in which case you ask them which city councilors oppose you. You make meetings with those councilors and repeat.\n\nSo this post has gotten to 2.5 pages now on my text editor, so it\u0019s time to wrap this up. To summarize:\n\n * You can influence your local politicians\n\n * You have more power than you might think\n\n * Write down your arguments succinctly and get it on a physical paper\n\n * Schedule a meeting, and don\u0019t stop asking for a meeting until they listen\n\n * War game with friends/family to iron down your talking points\n\n * Figure out what the barriers are and fight those as they come.\n\nThanks for reading, and feel free to ask questions in the comments. Good luck and fuck cars!\n\nEDIT: Oh forgot to mention, when all this is done, follow up with your politician.\n\"Hey I saw you voted for XYZ, good job.\"\n\"Hey we talked about XYZ a few weeks ago. Have you made any progress on that?\"\n\"Hey I saw YZX opposes you. I'm still in your corner. Don't let them get to you. I'll be seeing if I can talk to them.\"",

The problem isn\u0019t individual people or the cars they drive, the problem is designing the world to force people to own cars. This is akin to guilt tripping people for using single use stress instead of going after the corporations that cause most pollution. Yes everyone hates loud sports cars or giant lifted trucks that belch clouds of smoke constantly, but there is way too much hate directed at people that aren\u0019t doing anything wrong and not enough focus on the real problem. People that own trucks are not immoral the companies that lobby to make our cities unwalkable hellscapes are the problem.",

      "text": "When I try to convert someone to the Church of BanCar, the arguments that I emphasize depend on the situation. But for me, these are the top 5 arguments in favor of forbidding cars at least in cities (the order has changed over the last 2 years, after doing some research) :\n\n\\#1 - Money. Holy Crash, what an insane amount of money we (as a society and individuals) are pouring into this nightmare. It swallows 15-20% of GDP in \"developed\" countries (not only cars, but also giant space-consuming suburbs). Technically, we could fund universal healthcare, UBI, medical research and get rid of the debt in no time. This is criminal.\n\n\\#2 - Deaths and injuries. 1 million fatal collisions worldwide, #1 cause of death among young people. The numbers speak for themselves.\n\n\\#3 - Poor health related to noise, pollution and sedentary lifestyles. In terms of disabilities and deaths, this might be even worse than #2. (but impacts old people, so less life years).\n\n\\#4 - Waste of time. This is closely related to #1 (we work one day per week on average to fund our dependency) but in general, car journeys are actually time consuming, especially in dense areas. Moreover, traffic jams block emergency vehicles (see #3) and the time spent driving is not really \"leisure\" : you need to look at the road continuously, only 2 seconds of inattention could send you in jail or in the hospital.\n\n\\#5 - Stress. Because of #1 and #2 and #4, driving is stressful, which make people violent and irrational. But the stress generated by fast and numerous motor vehicles is also felt by pedestrians and residents. Kids and older people don't feel secure on the streets.\n\n\\----\n\n\\&gt;&gt; I know that \"most people in America can't afford to get rid of their car\" because of urban sprawl and they have kids and a large garden and so on. But life is made of choices, and some choices are hard. We're not in a matrix. America has reinvented itself many times.",

If you care about the climate, the future of cities, and our children walking on safe streets, then we gotta make our voices loud. If you care about jobs--from engineering, construction, and good-paying union jobs, this is the moment. To say I am disappointed is a true understatement. Governor Hochul announced today that she will \"indefinitely pause\" congestion pricing.\n\n&gt;The congestion pricing program would address traffic gridlock, air pollution, and the chronic underfunding of our transit system. But today, I\u0019m shocked and disappointed. Congestion pricing makes our transit system in our city and suburbs better. As an MTA Board Member and fiduciary, I have some questions for our political leaders: When will we be able to award contracts that support thousands of jobs in the region? What\u0019s the future of an unfunded public transit system? How can we focus on equity when, time and time again, we make cities for cars and not people? Why don\u0019t we want our roads to be safer?\n\n&gt;The way I see it, today it was announced, without MTA Board consultation, the cancellation of projects such as the Second Avenue Subway Phase II, our accessibility program with elevators and escalators in our subway system, and a fully zero-emission bus fleet. There is no plan B to fund the MTA.\n\n&gt;As I understand it, the MTA Board Members have a purview on the future of congestion pricing, including any significant delays or pauses. During this whole process, there was so much emphasis on Board Members being involved in the public hearing process, SAPA, the analysis of the traffic mobility board. We voted twice to move forward with this program. If there is a pause, I believe it is within the MTA board's authority to vote on such matters. Let's let it come to a vote.\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/midorivaldivia\\_re-congestion-pricing-in-nyc-activity-7204227740676321280-dKPw](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/midorivaldivia_re-congestion-pricing-in-nyc-activity-7204227740676321280-dKPw)",

[ULEZ zones charge a per-trip fee for cars with big engines or lots of exhaust pollution].\n - pushed back the Europe-wide ban on selling new combustion engine cars by 5 years.\n - pledged to make parking easier with unified payments.\n - stop councils from \"over-zealous\" fining of drivers for traffic violations.\n - prevent pay-per-mile schemes to charge drivers for road use.\n\nOver the last 14 years of Conservative government, they've reduced about 1/3rd of the country's bus services, because y'know busses need to be run for profit.\n\nThe Labour Party are the main competition, they:\n\n - want to address the soaring cost of car insurance.\n - make it easier to know the state of a second hand EV's battery pack.\n - continue the normal ICE car ban schedule.\n\nLib Dems are maybe the third party, they want to:\n \n - reduce car insurance.\n - reduce fuel prices at the pump.\n - promote EVs and build charging infrastructure.\n - continue the normal ICE car ban schedule.\n\nThe Green Party have some fuckcars ideas:\n\n - bring sooner the ICE ban.\n - remove all combustion cars from roads by 2035, scrappage scheme for ICE cars and financial support to buy EVs.\n - reform road tax proportional to the weight of the vehicle.\n - default 20mph speed limit in all built-up areas.\n - £19 billion over five years on upgrading the nation\u0019s bus and rail services and \u0018supporting electrification.\u0019\n - oppose all new road-building plans, fighting pollution.\n - £2.5 billion per year on fresh cycleways and footpaths to encourage people to step out of their cars and either walk or cycle for their local journeys.\n\nReform UK are a relatively new party under Nigel Farage, so basically no chance of getting power, but they say they are \"a voice for the country\" and their manifesto is:\n\n - scrap the entire HS2 high speed rail link.\n - cancel every low-emission zone and low-traffic neighbourhood in the nation.\n - abandon the petrol and diesel car ban entirely.\n - remove all legal requirements for car manufacturers to switch to making electric cars.\n - immediately issue extraction licences to plum the North Sea\u0019s gas and oil supplies.\n - reverse the UK\u0019s Net Zero targets and bin its related subsidies.\n\nhttps://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motoring-issues/2024-general-election/\n\n\nWoo. =D",

      "title": "Welcome to /r/Fuckcars",
      "text": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage &amp; Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## =K Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n&gt; Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

      "text": "Sub is quickly being watered down by more moderate folks who don\u0019t want to accept the fact that their status quo is disruptive to pedestrian and cyclist wellbeing. They\u0019re fine with shitting on cars as long as they aren\u0019t reminded they personally contribute to the problem and would have to give up some of their comforts.\n\nI just wanted to counter the growing sentiment I\u0019m seeing here that cars aren\u0019t a problem at all and it\u0019s actually all just car infrastructure. While car infrastructure is a *huge* piece of the problem, cars themselves definitely are an issue too.\n\nGenerally, automobiles are bad for the environment due to consumption of gasoline and the resulting carbon emissions, and car tires alone are a major source of micro particle pollution in our oceans. Cars are loud as hell, and they keep growing to become essentially tanks on wheels. And that\u0019s just a starting list of why cars are a problem.\n\nI love that so many new folks are being made aware of the (largely negative) impact that car infrastructure has on our lives, but cars themselves are included in that as well. Contrary to comments and posts from many people new here, the basis of this sub has *never* been \u001cfuck car infrastructure but we still love cars.\u001d\n\nEdit: So many people missing the entire fucking point have me questioning folks\u0019 reading comprehension skills.\n\nI never said the sub has one message and should only have one message. I said I am *countering* a common narrative I see in comments and posts that tends to go a little like, \u001cWell no one here actually hates cars or thinks cars are a problem. We all just hate car infrastructure.\u001d No, that\u0019s *not* how many of us feel. And that was never the sole basis of this community, so folks need to stop pretending that\u0019s how we all think.\n\nI also never said we need to ban all cars everywhere, so I\u0019m not sure whose ass people are pulling that out of. I\u0019m saying people should also acknowledge cars have a variety of negative effects on society and the environment that have *nothing* to do with infrastructure at all.",

      "text": "Link: https://www.wired.com/story/car-free-cities-opposition/\n\nSample:\n\n&gt;And any attempts to reduce urban car use tend to do better when designed from the bottom up. Barcelona\u0019s \u001csuperblocks\u001d programme, which takes sets of nine blocks within its grid system and limits cars to the roads around the outside of the set (as well as reducing speed limits and removing on-street parking) was shaped by having resident input on every stage of the process, from design to implementation. Early indicators suggest the policy has been wildly popular with residents, has seen nitrogen dioxide air pollution fall by 25 percent in some areas, and will prevent an estimated 667 premature deaths each year, saving an estimated 1.7 billion euros.\n\n&gt;When it comes to design, there\u0019s also the question of access. Whether it\u0019s emergency services needing to get in or small businesses awaiting deliveries, there\u0019s an important amount of \u001clast mile\u001d traffic\u0014transport that gets people or things to the actual end point of their journey\u0014that is vital to sustaining an urban area. If you want to reduce traffic, you have to work around that and think of alternative solutions\u0014such as allowing emergency vehicles access to pedestrianized areas, or even using automatic number plate recognition to exempt emergency vehicles from the camera checks that are used to police through-traffic in LTNs (which is what Lambeth is doing, Holland says).\n\n&gt;But even then, it\u0019s often just hard to convince people an entirely different city layout is possible. Getting people to accept that how they live alongside cars can be changed\u0014say, with an LTN\u0014takes time. But government surveys of the UK\u0019s recently implemented LTNs have indicated that support from residents for such schemes increases over time. \u001cIf you start seeing more and more of those kinds of things, things become thinkable,\u001d explains Aldred. If you start unpicking the idea that car use can\u0019t be changed, \u001cit starts to become possible to do more and more things without cars for people.\u001d\n\n&gt;The other issue is that, to put it simply, cars are never just cars. They\u0019re interwoven into our culture and consumption as symbols of affluence, independence, and success, and the aspiration to achieve those things in future. \u001cA man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure,\u001d the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher reportedly once said. \u001cThat\u0019s how we got in this mess in the first place, though,\u001d says Crawford. \u001cEverybody saw that the rich people were driving cars, and they wanted to too.\u001d",

      "text": "Sydney air quality study suggests most people in the city\u0019s greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution at levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe study examined the concentration of PM2.5 \u0013 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These invisible fine particles can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream. They cause heart and lung disease. The aged, children and people with previous heart and lung problems are considered most at risk.\n\nWHO guidelines, updated in 2021, recommend exposure to average PM2.5 levels of less than 5 micrograms a cubic metre over a year. The study estimated the average for Sydney was 6.43. They reached 12 in parts of the Upper Hunter.\n\nThe largest source of air pollution was found to be *wood heaters, used in about 10% of homes (Contributes to 269 premature deaths annually, $2bn health costs) \nIndustrial sites including mines (133 deaths, $1bn costs). \nCoal power stations (46 deaths and $346m)*\n\n**Cars and Trucks (110 deaths and $832m)**\n\nBrad Smith, policy director with the Nature Conservation Council, said the results showed air pollution was a \u001csilent epidemic\u001d. He said it underlined the need for governments to \u001cleave coal, gas and oil in the ground and wood in forests\u001d.\n\nWhile wood heaters and road vehicles were the biggest sources of air pollution in Sydney itself, pollution in the Hunter was largely caused by coalmines, coal power generation and diesel vehicles used at mines.\n\n\nSmith said the reliance on wood heaters could be solved by banning their sale and offering incentives for households to switch to reverse-cycle electric heaters. By 2030, every bus and garbage truck in the state should be electric and coal power should be replaced by renewable energy and storage, he said.\n\n\u001cThese astronomical health costs really put radical policy solutions on the table,\u001d he said.\n\n\u001cFor example, the cost of reducing all public transport fares to $1 is estimated at $750m. That\u0019s less than the annual health cost caused by petrol and diesel vehicles of $900m.\u001d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/air-pollution-in-nsw-causes-603-premature-deaths-and-costs-48bn-a-year-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\n**The NSW Clean Air Strategy 2021-2030**\n\n\nDoes address cars and trucks with:\n\n*Zero Emissions Bus Transition Strategy* to transition to electric battery buses and hydrogen fuel cell technology. \n\n*Walking and Cycling Program*  to create cycling and walking connections/parths around Sydney.\n\n *NSW Electric Vehicle Strategy* to increase electric vehicle use through government rebates and building charges.",

      "text": "Yesterday at a party someone repeatedly offered me a lift but I insisted that I wanted to go back home with the tram. It was 11 PM and a lift would have spared me 20 minutes.\n\nI listed all the reasons (again) why I was against using cars in a city (safety, noise, pollution, climate, wasted money) but there was something I could not really articulate related to \"being there, in public spaces at night, in case of\". The moment I reached the tram station I knew what I should I have said : I think it's important to make streets safer by outnumbering dodgy assholes. The more \"normal\" people there are in the streets or subway stations, the less trouble for everyone, especially the vulnerable.\n\nIt was especially relevant yesterday because at some point in the tram, a drunken guy started to behave in a slightly annoying way (trying to make eye contact just to get into trouble) and we were just 2, a young woman and me, around him. If I hadn't been there, he would definitely have tried to bother her. At the next station, young people entered the tram en masse, and the drunken guy went waaay calmer, shutting up altogether.\n\nThis is an argument that is difficult to bring forth in a conversation. \"I want to walk/bike to make the street nicer for everyone\". It sounds dumb and sort of pseudo heroical, so it's hard to formulate. I know there are places that are too weird at night to dare do this. But for like 99% of places, if we all had this mindset, it would definitely be safer.\n\nMaybe we should call that \"street presence\" or something. If all \"nice people\" are in their cars zooming past vulnerable pedestrians in deserted streets, then the image of public spaces at night will always have a bad rep, and the vicious circle will never be broken.",

Yet, the faster trains are somehow more incompatible with a large country than slower cars? \n\nNobody uses the interstate highway system to drive from San Francisco to New York, but instead between cities along the route that are connected because of the highway. In the same way, an hsr line from San Francisco to New York could serve intermediate metros like Denver or St Louis. All this can be done with less land use, less pollution, faster speeds, and lower maintenance costs.\n\n Claiming that trains are \"slow\" (which they aren't) and therefore the infrastructure shouldn't be built is a dumb argument.",

      "text": "I've been meaning to do this write-up for a little while. A significant portion of people who are at least lukewarm to the idea of reducing car dependency are extremely reluctant about any criticism of their own car, or criticism of the concept of car ownership. And I think it's good to set the record straight:\n\nFuck your car.\n\nI don't like your car. I don't like that it exists, I don't like where it's parked, and I don't like where it's driven. And frankly, I don't care what you do with the car: I still don't like your car. It's a big waste of space that serves as street litter 95% of the time and acts as a deadly bullet flying through spaces where people live the other 5%.\n\nBut, you may say, I have reasons for driving this car. Public transit doesn't exist where I live, I have a big family, I live 30 kilometres from work, I'm a car enthusiast and drive it on a track, I need it to haul furniture, and I use it for work sometimes.\n\nBut still: Fuck your car. I don't care how valid or invalid those reasons are. If they're invalid, then fuck you, and get rid of the car already. If they're valid\u0014and they're often really not, but let's say they are\u0014then that sucks. It sucks that circumstance makes it so that operating a loud giant metal cage of death, pollution and climate disaster is the only viable option for you.\n\nBut still: Fuck your car. Your valid reasons don't make me dislike cars any less. Your valid reasons don't decrease the car's harm to the climate or people's living environments. If anything, we should change circumstance to invalidate your reasons for operating the damned thing so that you can get rid of it already.\n\nThere exists a future without private vehicles. We probably want to keep ambulances, fire trucks, buses, and some industrial vehicles, but there exists a future where public spaces\u0014all public spaces\u0014belong to people again. A future where the biggest private mobility tools are the size of golf carts.\n\nAnd the sooner we can get rid of your fucking car, the better.",

Nobody really knows.\u001d The former US president added that rising sea levels, caused by melting glaciers, would have the benefit of creating \u001cmore oceanfront property\u001d.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk, meanwhile, said it was wrong to \u001cvilify\u001d the oil and gas industry, the key driver of planet-heating pollution, and that the only imperative to ditch fossil fuels was that they will one day run dry.\n\n&gt;\u001cIf we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse,\u001d said Musk, who is also chief executive of the electric car company Tesla. \u001cWe do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of oil and gas.\n\n&gt;\u001cWe still have quite a bit of time & we don\u0019t need to rush and we don\u0019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that. Like, leave the farmers alone.\u001d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Musk said the main danger of allowing carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere was that at some point it will become difficult to breathe, causing \u001cheadaches and nausea\u001d to people. This would occur with CO2 at about 1,000 parts per million of the Earth\u0019s atmosphere, more than double the current record-breaking concentrations.\n\nTo be clear, this is a problem soon because we're talking about indoor air which needs to be replaced with outdoor air. The higher outdoor CO2 concentration makes that process more difficult. We don't have to wait until the atmospheric levels are 1000 ppm https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000237 \n\nI think this pretty much confirms what we've been saying for years:  electric cars are here to save the car industry, not the planet. \n\n",

They're incredibly loud and distributing to the peace; not only in cities, but also in the rural areas.\n\n  \nGuys, guys. Believe me, I see where you're coming from. The cost of their infrastructure is in the trillions of dollars each year in America. They increase social isolation, and artificially create human anger when people operate them. They prevent teenagers and younger children from having mobility freedom. The roads they're used for destroy natural habitats, as well as decrease the albedo of the Earth's surface, increasing global warming. They're uncomfortable to sit in, most of the time. They prevent both relaxation and productivity when using them. There's a lot of bureaucratic loopholes to jump through to keep them registered with the state.\n\nAnd I know y'all are not happy about how traffic jams drastically reduce mobility regularly, and are often incredibly unpredictable. And believe me, I completely empathize with how parking lots and garages clog up valuable real estate in our cities and about. I recognize how expensive they are for the average consumer, impoverishing what is otherwise a fairly rich person.

I cannot understand why because:\n\n# Good things about limiting all cars to 25 km/h:\n\n* If busses and trains go much faster than cars, this will increase the use of public transportation over long distances and decrease the use of cars. It will also increase the use of bikes because cars would no longer have a speed advantage.\n* Inside of towns cars won't be racing around pedestrians and cyclists. Instead, they will match the speed of cyclists. ( **This is the main reason** )\n* Assuming that car motors get designed for 25 km/h, they would become much more fuel efficient. Compare 130km/h + 20 headwind with 25 km/h + 20 headwind, the car would have only 9% air resistance at 25 km/h as it would at 130 km/h. This will greatly increase the fuel efficiency.\n* Highways will become accessible to everyone: not only cars, but also cyclists could now legally and safely use them.\n* Unless on a highway... going fast can be very stressful.\n* No more noise pollution from cars traveling at high speeds\n* Because less accidents happen, insurance will become much cheaper so this is even a good thing for the drivers!\n* Bike paths would probably not be necessary anymore.\n\n# Bad things about limiting all cars to 25 km/h:\n\n* Commute takes longer, inconvenient to drivers. But there is the option to use faster public transportation.\n* Slower in case of emergencies. But even this is not nearly as bad as all the deaths caused by high speed vehicles.\n\nUnless I missed something big, it is extremely obvious that limiting every car to 25 km/h has more bigger upsides than downsides.",

Move to a suburb with \u001cgood schools\u001d\nB. Send your children to a private/catholic school\nC. Send your kids to the city public school\n\nThe married couple wouldn\u0019t pick C because they fear that their kid will turn out bad as a result of going to a city public school and private schools are expensive.\n\nSo they would pick A. Often these suburbs are filled with similar types of people with similar jobs and interests. This leads to segregation. For instance in Pittsburgh, the suburbs are mostly white with a Asian minority ranging from 1% to 20% of the population and blacks/latinos ranging from (2% to 15%) while city schools are plurality African American. The most striking instance of this is the suburb of Jefferson Hills and Clairton, the former which is 90% white and a mostly affluent bedroom community and is rural ish and the town of Clairton which has a US Steel steel plant that releases pollutants and the majority of it relies on the plant and the town is 66% black and you can notice the smell from the plant, even in the lower elevation areas of Jefferson hills. \n\nThis becomes a self repeating cycle which leads to more segregation and isolation. \n\nHow can we address this underdiscussed issue that leads to people moving to car dependent suburbs?",

      "title": "Don't like Tyre Extuingishers? Cool, but please read this first",
      "text": "Since their start, Tyre Extinguishers has often appeared in this sub, drawing praise and criticism. Not everyone in this sub appreciates deflating tyres of SUVs to make a point.\n\nAs a result, all TX posts see a flood of similar comments opposing their actions. Unfortunately, many arguments are based on misunderstanding what TX actually is and does or what direct action entails.\n\nWhile obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it would be a shame if we kept running around and regurgitating the same talking points. So, to help the discussion move along, here's a list of commonly used thoughts on why TX sucks, with a short reaction.\n\n\\---\n\n* **This will only aggravate SUV drivers and turn them against your cause.**  \nEverything you do to prevent people from driving more and larger SUVs will turn SUV drivers against you. To quote a wise man or woman: 'If a protest doesn't inconvenience, it's not a protest; it's a picnic.' TX is not looking to make friends with drivers. They want unnecessary SUVs off the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is dangerous. Letting people drive around with deflated tyres is incredibly irresponsible.**  \nTX leaves a leaflet on the windshield to alert drivers that their tyres are deflated. That, combined with possible warning lights in the car and the fact that any driver will quickly notice a flat tyre, means the real chance of someone driving off with their flat tyre is negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **So now a diesel-powered tow truck has to make extra trips to get the SUV back on the road? I'm suddenly pretending to be hyper-focused on emissions, and this seems counter-productive.**  \nThe goal of deflating tyres is not to reduce the number of trips of that particular vehicle. Instead, TX is after the large-scale systemic change by spreading its message far and wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Some people live where a car is the only option, you know?**  \nThen TX will be no problem. They clearly state they only operate in urban environments. So nobody will have their tyres deflated in the suburbs or rural areas. Not by TX, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This is not an effective way to spread your message.**  \nLiterally, hundreds and hundreds of news articles from all over the world, including some really nuanced background stories in some of the most prominent outlets, beg to differ. TX has been remarkably effective in spreading its anti-SUV arguments to the general audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Imagine being a single mother with three jobs/a poor worker just trying to get by and finding your tyres deflated, with no money to call roadside service and now you lose your job and whaa-whaa!**  \nTX clearly states they target posh vehicles in upscale neighbourhoods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **What if people need to haul stuff for their work? Or need a large vehicle to store their wheelchair?**  \nTX clearly states they don't target vehicles clearly marked as for work or for disabled or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **This will do nothing to reduce the number of cars on the road.**  \nTX clearly states they are against SUVs and large 4x4s in urban area's. They are unnecessarily dangerous and polluting. TX are not anti-car per se.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Why target innocent individuals? They should target oil companies/car manufacturers/car dealers/politicians instead!**  \nPlease look at this handy '[Moderates guide to doing absolutely nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/y30j3q/based_on_actual_conversations_on_this_sub/)' made especially for you.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **We support slashing tyres now?**  \nTX doesn't slash tyres. They deflate them. Pump 'em back up, and SUVs are back on the road; message sent, no damage done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I've thought up a scenario where someone who doesn't deserve it is still terribly inconvenienced by their flat tyre. But I bet you haven't considered that, huh?!**  \nSince around 35 million SUVs were sold in 2021 alone (roughly 45 per cent of all cars sold), and TX claims to have deflated 10,000 vehicles in just over half a year, that scenario is implausible.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I heard they deflate the tyres of eSUVs and hybrids as well, proving my theory that they are not environmentalists, just hooligans.**  \nElectric or hybrid SUVs are still unsafe and, in many cases, unnecessary. Furthermore, tailpipe emissions are not the only pollution. Besides the large carbon footprint these enormous cars have, tyre wear causes tremendous particle pollution. eSUVS are typically heavier and have more torque, causing more strain on tyres and thus polluting more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **I understand their point, but I am against touching people's personal stuff.**  \nFair enough. But remember that SUVs are more dangerous for those not inside that vehicle, take up more public space and emit more pollution for you to breathe in. They mess with you personally every day, and drivers seem to either not know or not care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **If you want to get your point across, why not attend a protest? Why not take up a role in your local government? Why not do this or that?**  \nAll of those things can exist together. Disruptive direct action is not a substitute for protesting or actively shaping policy. It's an addition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **There are better ways to protest.**  \nPlease leave them in the comments so we can learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTX have [a website](https://www.tyreextinguishers.com/) where you can read what they do and why they do it. Makes of lot of comments in this sub redundant.",

Our youngest sister works at an outpatient clinic in a hospital a few minutes' walking distance from her apartment (the main reason she was so excited to get the job) -- would someone who lived that close to a hospital really have to spend money to cause unnecessary pollution rather than put her baby in a stroller or sling to walk home?\n\nI know you're probably not up for a lot of walking after giving birth. I definitely understand requiring a baby to be safe before letting parents put them in a car, but acting like a carseat is the only way to transport a baby?

      "text": "I've tagged this as \"Activism\" because there's a call to action.\n\nYou're probably quite confused by the title - what does New York State have *anything* to do with a project that connects the Las Vegas and Los Angeles areas?\n\nHere's what's going on: **Politicians from upstate New York are trying to meddle with Brightline West by trying to force it to use what is likely to be an inferior manufacturer of trainsets.**\n\nBrightline West has requested a waiver from the Buy America law due to a lack of availability - both for trainsets and for infrastructure components. It is the trainsets that are at issue here.\n\nThere are two trainset proposals that the waiver is seeking approval for.\n\nThe first proposal is from Siemens and would use trainsets based off the Velaro series, which has been successfully used in several other countries [for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Velaro). For the Brightline West project, the first two trainsets would be made and assembled overseas, and the remaining 8 would be assembled in the US with their structure, frame, and paintwork made overseas.\n\nThe second proposal is from Alstom. This proposal would use trainsets based on the new Acela trainsets. Like the new Acela trainsets, these would assembled in Hornell, New York. As many of us know, the new Acela trainsets have been delayed for three years and counting due to [numerous problems](https://www.businessinsider.com/amtraks-new-acela-trains-manufacturing-defects-oig-audit-2023-10) \\- and not a single one has entered service.\n\nYet despite these facts, several politicians from upstate New York (it wouldn't surprise me if they've never traveled by high-speed rail - or any train - at all) have commented on the FRA's waiver request and are trying to get the FRA to only accept the likely-inferior Alstom proposal. Some have even argued that this is the only way to benefit \"local communities\" - but of course, they're not talking about local communities in Nevada or California, they're talking about local communities in upstate New York.\n\nLet me be clear: **This is a Nevada and California project that New York has no right to benefit from, just like how Nevada and California have no right to benefit from a New York project.**\n\nThese politicians are...\n\n1. Completely ignoring (or worse, deliberately sidestepping) the harm that delaying this project would have on local communities. [Congestion](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/i-15-south-to-california-jammed-again-as-2023-begins-2701236/) on I-15 is a problem - and it also exacerbates the [pollution](https://news3lv.com/news/local/las-vegas-air-quality-ranked-among-dirtiest-in-the-us) problem.\n2. Completely ignoring (or worse, deliberately sidestepping) the harm that delaying this project would have on the environment. The [busiest](https://simpleflying.com/what-are-the-usas-busiest-domestic-air-routes/) domestic air route in the US is between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Short flights like that are unnecessary and harmful to the environment, and Las Vegas' airport is also [dangerously close](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/as-harry-reid-airport-grows-so-does-the-need-for-another-airport-2723758/) to hitting capacity limits.\n3. Trying to treat Brightline West as a jobs program instead of a transportation service.\n4. Perpetuating xenophobia. (or, to be more specific, not-invented-here syndrome.)\n\nLeave a comment **by January 25** to tell the FRA to unconditionally approve Brightline West's waiver request - in particular, the Siemens proposal - and help get this show on the (rail)road. The environment is calling on you.\n\nI'd recommend focusing on the reasons why local communities will benefit from HSR, as well as the respective track records of Siemens and Alstom.\n\n[https://www.regulations.gov/document/FRA-2023-0099-0001](https://www.regulations.gov/document/FRA-2023-0099-0001)",

Discontent is growing from both side of the parisian electorate as the right accuses her of being too extreme and too fast in her policies while a growing part of the left criticizes her \"fake consultations\" as a way to hide her lack of political strenght. \n\nTensions crystalize around the percieved miss-handling of the coming Olympics that are ever less popular for the parisian public and it is unsure they will see this vote as a pressing matter.\n\nAs a french and parisian myself I can answer your questions on this topic.

But I've started to see now that just because you're in a metal box that can do 70+mph it doesn't give you any more intrinsic rights than other road users, and the fact that infrastructure is generally designed to favour car traffic is a problem with the infrastructure, not a sign that car drivers are a 'chosen people'.\n\nAlso I used to think that electric cars would solve everything. While they're undeniably better than ICE cars, I realise that pollution is only a small part of the problem, and none of the other parts will be solved by EVs. A 'transport revolution' that is just a 1:1 transition from ICE to EVs is a massive wasted opportunity in my opinion.\n\nSo yeah, thanks guys, and fuck cars.",

      "text": "I am severely disappointed by the mods in that they pinned [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/wwy8p3/stop_saying_carbrain_improving_the_dialogue_on/).    \n\nOP's message basically boils down to \"the idea of the sub is great, but stop being so mean about it because it might turn some people away\"    \n\n**The first reason** why that argument is problematic is because it is historically inaccurate.   \nMLK Jr.'s popularity right before his death was polling in the low 20%. He was incredibly divisive during his advocating with most Americans hating him.   \nIt's not until after his death and the social progress that was made that he became to be seen in a more positive light. And these days he's revered as a great man.     \n\nAnd we see this in many other cases too. The Suffragettes weren't exactly nice about their demands either. They knew it was unfair that women didn't get to vote and had no time for any man that didn't agree with them. They were very provocative for the time in which they lived.     \n\nIt's also ahistorical when looking specifically to the history of this sub and other subs with similar ideas like /r/urbanplanning /r/notjustbikes and /r/bikecommuting   \nAll 3 of those subs have a more chill atmosphere where insults are restricted or toned done. None of them come even close to the subscriber count of this sub. In fact, only the urbanplanning sub has slightly more subscribers than this sub had **before** the huge influx of /r/place users. And given the trajectories before /r/place, this sub would've easily overtaken the urbanplanning sub even without that influx.  So the fact that the aggressive tone scares people away is just not true. This sub is actually the most successful in getting the message out there.     \n\n**The second reason** why it's problematic is because there seem to be a lot of people on this sub who have been fighting car-centric infrastructure for a long time before this sub ever existed. And sometimes it can feel as if you're in a world surrounded by people who don't get it which can feel quite alone.    \n\nThis sub has been a breath of fresh air. Finally a place where we find many like-minded and don't need to be careful about what we say to avoid offending people who just don't get it and probably never will.  Finally a place where the people who insult us and ignore us are the weird ones while our views are normal. A place where we can post memes and laugh about the stupid way society is structured. And where we can complain about these things without having to argue about whether or not car-centric design actually sucks or is a good thing.       \n\nBut apparently, we're not welcome here because we need to try and be nice with the people who at best will ignore us and at worst will hurl abusive statements at us. Like I haven't been doing that even before this sub came along. It just doesn't work.    \nPeople hate change. I've literally spoken in person with over 100 people in-depth who believed cars are best and have gone in-depth on how it sucks. Statistics on pollution, cost to society, loss of space, costs of injury and death, ...   \nIt doesn't matter. They just don't want to hear.     \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nDon't get me wrong, I totally support the fact that OP feels this way and wants to voice his opinion on this debate. He is entitled to his opinion. He hates car-centric design and that's why he's more than welcome.    \nBut other people like me don't share his opinion even though we accept him and his opinion here. And by the mods pinning this thread, to me that feels like an official endorsement of the message. A sign to people like me that we should find a different place to vent our anger and frustration over people who will just never listen and always oppose what we advocate for.    \n\nAnd that is disappointing. I sincerely hope it remains at this pinned thread and that it doesn't become official policy to start policing the tone of the way people vent their frustration to try and make the sub more appealing to.. well.. car brains.     \n\n-----------------    \n\nOther than that, I do want to commend the Mods for the work you guys do. The influx of subscribers after /r/place must not have been easy to handle. In general, I think you guys do a great job listening to criticism of the users of this sub, which is actually the only reason I'm even writing it. If I didn't think you guys were open to criticism, I wouldn't even bother.      \n\nI also want to commend you on the AMA's that have been hosted and hope to see more of them in the future!

The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf). It is literally [Econ 101](http://sites.bu.edu/manove-ec101/files/2014/10/EC101Outlines14-Externalities.pdf). The idea [won a Nobel Prize](http://environment.yale.edu/news/article/william-nordhaus-wins-nobel-prize-for-economics-of-climate-change/). Thanks to researchers at MIT, you can see for yourself how it compares with other mitigation policies [here](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.11).",

Brussels is emblematic for the experience of many European cities that have been completely transformed for the convenience of cars in a blind pursuit of economic growth in the previous century. Only in recent years the regional government has launched efforts to turn back the clock, but needless to say they are being assailed by drivers at every step. Of course, many car commuters live in privileged suburbs and are not forced to breathe the filth they leave behind.",

      "text": "I just don't understand. A high percentage of US jobs are sedentary and use computers. If we want to reduce the footprint of transportation, wouldn't it make sense to eliminate the need for so much transportation to begin with?\nIt certainly seems more feasible than all these other ideas that require large economic and social shifts. We also know that it works as smog dropped drastically during the first isolated months of the pandemic. And remote work is a solution that could be implemented immediately as the infrastructure already exists and some companies already have the tools to do it. They simply choose not to. \n\nSo why is it not championed as an easy solution to decrease pollution and car use?",

      "text": "I've never ridden an electric bike. But I'm familiar with modern battery and motor tech, and how far it has come in the past several years. An E-bike allows you to traverse great distances at speeds similar or greater than the average speed of a car stuck in traffic. You're outside, getting fresh air, and getting a bit of exercise too. If the battery runs out or the motor fails, you just pedal, and can easily maintain a running/jogging speed with the same effort it takes to walk. You can park it pretty much anywhere. They're basically free to operate compared to a car, new tires for an E-bike might be 100 bucks tops, meanwhile my tiny miata was 400 for the cheapest all season tires I could find. Not to mention the lack of oil changes or other maintenance that comes with a large internal combustion engine. The infrastructure for an E-bike is cheap and easy to maintain, too. And, of course, the almost complete lack of pollution caused by manufacturing and operating one. I have no idea why E-bikes aren't more popular, aside from areas with insufficient infrastructure to support them. I guess most people still see them as overpriced toys.\n\nEdit: In case it isn't obvious, It's gonna depend on your use case. If you commute half a mile and have to deal with stairs, a regular bike is better. If you live in an area with no bike paths, a motorcycle or scooter might be better. I'm glad I've spurred so much conversation on the topic!",
