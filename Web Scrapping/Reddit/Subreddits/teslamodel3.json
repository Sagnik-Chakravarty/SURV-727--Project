      "text": "  \n\n[Delivery day. Was smiling then, still smiling now.](https://preview.redd.it/m0hqmauk48961.jpg?width=754&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ef068dfef6603aaaba7df16c9b1dae6583b3be)\n\nTrim: 2021 Model 3 SR+, white interior, white exterior, no FSD\n\nOrder date: 10/16/20\n\nDelivery date: 12/19/20 \n\nBackground: Resident of Washington State (west side). We have dogs, no kids. I am a shareholder and an enthusiast of all things Tesla, but prior to picking up F.R.I.D.A.Y. two weeks ago I had never driven a Tesla or any other BEV. I am coming from nine years of driving a 2012 Toyota Prius, a fantastically reliable car that I had no reason to sell other than wanting something new. The combination of the stock\u0019s performance and the refresh convinced me to take the plunge and find out if you crazy, kool-aid-drinking Redditors are right to say that Tesla ruins all other cars forever. Spoiler alert: in my opinion, you're pretty much right.\n\nHere are my thoughts about the delivery experience, the first drive home, Tesla service, and the car itself after two weeks and approximately 450 miles. \n\n**Delivery experience: 9.5/10.** After two months of incessantly refreshing my Tesla account page for delivery updates, I picked up my SR+ from the Renton service center. The staff was friendly and professional. I signed a few papers, got a few questions answered, and was inspecting my car within minutes. I've waited in grocery store lines longer than it took me to pick up this car. The staff did not push me along and I did take my time inspecting. The only reason I\u0019m deducting half of a point is because of seemingly random glitches in the online delivery process \u0013 my loan terms inexplicably changed, and my delivery appointment was initially cancelled for no reason. An e-mail to my sales rep got all of this easily resolved, however.\n\n**Build quality: 9.5/10**. As a frequent forum reader, I knew the most common issues to check for. I found nothing to flag for the service center staff while on the lot. Even after scrutinizing all of the panel gaps, I saw nothing remarkable. The car was clean, inside and out. No paint issues. No heating issues. No window issues. I even inspected the underside for damage. I found nothing but a really, really nice-looking car. Why not a perfect 10? A few days later, I noticed that the center console was slightly off-center, closer to the driver side, and the lid would rub a bit against the driver\u0019s seat when opening upward. This is an extremely minor quibble that arguably doesn\u0019t even merit a deduction. For those curious, I did receive a 128GB Samsung flash drive in the glove box, 30 days of premium connectivity, and a year of free super-charging (but no FSD trial or model 3 toy replica despite a stack of them sitting in the store window).\n\n**Driving experience: 9/10.** I\u0019m not going to lie, having never driven a Tesla and being in a busy, unfamiliar town I was a little nervous driving off the lot. All the youtube videos in the world can only prepare you so much for piloting the space ship that is the Model 3. After fiddling around with the settings for an embarrassingly long time, I set F.R.I.D.A.Y. to chill mode and headed out (which, by the way, accelerates better than \u001cpower mode\u001d on a Prius). Once I got going on the interstate, it was smooth sailing all the way home. I actually found myself smiling, which I was not really expecting. My concerns about \u001csettling\u001d for the SR+ evaporated pretty quickly. Accelerating (especially from about 20mph) really lives up to the BEV/Tesla hype. The \u001cpartial premium\u001d sound system is very good and I do not feel the need to upgrade it, but I would not say it is a huge leap forward from the Prius. Mids and highs are very clear, which for me is the most important thing. My range anxiety is also evaporating pretty quickly \u0013 I slow-charge at 5-6mph to \\~70% at home, which offers an estimated 193 miles of range. At this point, I\u0019m glad I saved the \\~$12,000 (after considering the WA tax incentive situation) by opting for the SR+.\n\nOther impressions: \n\n· One-pedal driving on \u001chold\u001d mode is a revelation \u0013 it took some adjusting to, but it is something I\u0019m coming to love. \n\n· Autopilot is solid. I\u0019ve encountered only one place on my normal driving routes that gives it trouble (it tries to enter an emerging left-turn lane instead of proceeding straight ahead) but on normal highway driving it is starting to earn my trust. It does a great job managing traffic, but I\u0019m not sure how much I can trust it to handle traffic merging from on-ramps.\n\n· I\u0019m slightly mixed on the white interior, but overall my partner and I both like it. This was the only decision I agonized over when ordering the car. There is no denying that the seats are stunning, and I love the interior/exterior black/white synergy with the new blacked-out trim. Both of us have worn jeans in the car almost exclusively, and I have noticed no dye transfer yet. Baby wipes are at the ready, though. I do get pretty significant glare on the driver side window from the white dash panel, which is pretty annoying especially because it coincides with the side mirror. I\u0019m debating wrapping or replacing the white trim to help reduce this issue, but I think the reflection is going to be inevitable no matter what I do and may just be something I come to live with.\n\n· Auto-dimming headlights work fairly well, and auto wipers work pretty well too. Both could be improved, but I\u0019m not experiencing a reason for the level of complaints about these features just yet.\n\n· Accessories I love so far: I installed a matte screen protector, and I\u0019d call this a must-have accessory. It actually makes the screen look nicer IMO. I have also installed aluminum pedals, which I think are well worth the $30 even if they are a pain to install, and had 3M PPF installed on the front bumper for $400. Finally, I have the Tesla-branded Weather Tech hard floor liners, which I\u0019d call a must-have given that the SR+ doesn\u0019t even come with carpet mats.\n\n· I love the minimalism of the interior and everything being centralized on one screen. It took me no time to adjust to looking for my current speed to my right. I even looked into after-market HUD solutions prior to driving, but I have no interest in this now. \n\n· The infotainment display is a game-changer, and while the latest UI needs some improvements (we should have the choice to have larger navigation maps), I\u0019m blown away by what is on offer here. LTE streaming music, Youtube TV (with subscription), a console-grade gaming experience & does any other car-maker offer anything like this? (I don\u0019t think so.) I\u0019ve never sat playing with a car in my garage before, so that\u0019s saying something (perhaps not a positive something, but there you go). I am looking forward to setting up a Tesla date night where we go find a scenic, quiet location with good LTE and watch a movie.\n\n· Other criticisms, such as they are, include somewhat noticeable road noise at higher speeds (it is merely average and similar to the Prius, even with the thicker front windows), lack of adequate blind spot warnings, a somewhat laggy UI for certain non-essential functions like entertainment, and no easy way to simultaneously disengage both Autopilot and cruise without tapping the break (that I know of). \n\n**Mobile service experience: 10/10.** A few days after delivery, the car began producing numerous \u001cB pillar camera blinded/blocked\u001d error messages due to condensation. Driving conditions did not seem to affect when the errors occurred, nor did preheating the cabin solve the issue, so I easily scheduled a mobile service appointment. My experience from start to finish was great \u0013 they even tried to move up my appointment when an opening became available. The tech was very professional and friendly, and explained the situation to me. He said this was a known, common issue that he regularly is called out to inspect. He disassembled the B pillar camera casings and confirmed that the gore patches had already been removed, which is a known way to address this issue. He couldn\u0019t offer a solution but thought that Tesla would have a fix coming soon for this because it is so common in wet areas like western WA. He also topped off my tire pressure and did a system inspection. Other than the lack of a solution, the experience was very positive and hopefully I\u0019ll never have to go to a service center for car maintenance again. Also: subsequent to the mobile service visit, I put in a moisture-absorbing bag in the back and have not gotten another error message about the cameras, despite the driving conditions being the same. Hopefully it was a fluke thing. \n\n**TL/DR: My Tesla experience has been very positive. From purchasing to delivery to driving to service, I would say that Tesla has made every part of the experience feel more effortless. My long wait for a Model 3 feels worth it, at least at this early juncture. It\u0019s the most fun I\u0019ve ever had in a car, and I encourage those who can responsibly afford it to consider a Tesla for their next vehicle.**\n\nThanks to the members of this Model 3 subreddit for all sorts of helpful information over the years -- this is a great community and your contributions are much appreciated!",

      "text": "I\u0019ve been subbed here for some time, and I have been looking forward to the day I can say I own a Tesla since Jeremy Clarkson gave his scathing review of the Roadster way back when. \n\nFriday afternoon, at 32 years old, I can finally say I own a Tesla. I bought my used 2019 Model 3 Long Range AWD with acceleration boost to replace my 2014 BMW i3 BEV.\n\nI\u0019ve followed Tesla blogs/podcasts/subreddits for long enough to have what I thought of as \u001crealistic\u001d expectations when it came to ownership experience. I knew to expect snappy acceleration up to and maybe just past \u001cnormal\u001d highway speed. I knew to expect a minimalistic interior. I knew to expect less than stellar build quality and fit &amp; finish. I knew to expect strong responses from others - both positive and negative. I was right about just about everything. \n\nThe only thing that really did surprise me, and this is where I say maybe I got lucky, was my interior build quality. I don\u0019t have any rattles. I don\u0019t have any squeaks. I don\u0019t have any wind noise worth mentioning. Interior noise is similar to any other luxurious vehicles I\u0019ve been in i.e. my in-laws 2018 Escalade, my wife\u0019s Grand Cherokee Overland.\n\nI don\u0019t have any real reason for this post except to say that I am pleasantly surprised as a new owner of a Tesla. I\u0019m not a photographer so I didn\u0019t have a good \u001chere is my new car\u001d post. But, hi.",

      "title": "The One Month Review: Philly Suburbs Edition",
      "text": "So after the first month of owning my Model 3 (SR) in southeastern Pennsylvania, I've already learned quite a few useful tidbits of information about the car itself and its various post-delivery needs. Since some of these things include issues without immediate answers, If figured I'd share my experience for others living in our Tesla-heavy area who haven't yet taken delivery or for those who find other people writing about familiar surroundings enjoyable.\n\n**Pre-Delivery**: So between my initial order and my delivery, I moved from the D.C.-area back to PA. Of course, this was a very stupid move planning-wise for me, as it made the entire delivery process much more complicated than it needed to be. ***DO NOT*** do this if your estimated delivery is in the same general timeframe as your move. I was told, rather explicitly, by my Sales Rep (SA) that I couldn't take delivery of a vehicle with a PA license in Virginia, despite being told the opposite by a salesperson at the Tesla store I purchased from. Thankfully, I had ordered in the store with said SA, and so changing delivery sites was relatively straightforward. Additionally, I needed to update information such as my new Drivers License and Insurance, which I chose to do instead at the Devon location shortly after getting those things. If you're doing this same boneheaded process, I'd recommend just going to a Tesla store to do it instead of talking over the phone.\n\nOther assorted pre-delivery tidbits:\n\n* Carvana gave me an absolute fortune for my previous vehicle. Granted, it was in excellent condition and had low mileage, but thanks to the used car market, I got about 50% more than Kelly Blue Book had quoted me on. Very smooth process selling the car, and I chose to do so before moving to avoid PA's [very dumb vehicle registration process for new residents](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/New-Resident-Relocation-Information/New%20Residents/Pages/Motor-Vehicle-Information-for-New-Residents.aspx) and the associated fees.\n\n* If you do a test drive, I'd highly suggest a route between the Devon and KoP stores. Its a good mix of highway traffic along a short stretch of 202, as well as the type of residential and multi-lane roads you're probably used to driving during your normal routine. Even if you've already ordered a car, I'd strongly recommend doing it if you haven't already to get a feel for how it handles so your first experiences with regen braking aren't in a crowded parking lot with lots of other cars.\n\n**Delivery Day**: While there was some slight panel misalignment and and a few other small cosmetic issues, the delivery was an extremely smooth process. Minus my detailed inspection of the car and personalizing the interface, the total time spent doing paperwork and waiting was approximately 15 minutes. One important thing to note about the Devon location is that it had virtually no parking available. I was thankfully able to get a spot, but I'm pretty sure it was the last one available. Also important to know is that there is only parking on the east side of the service center, the other side appears to be strictly for inventory and was packed to the brim with wrapped up cars awaiting future delivery.\n\n**Post-Delivery**: For PA, there are some interesting things in the immediate post-delivery timeframe that are good to know ahead of time. These include:\n\n* Tesla's PA Service Centers aren't certified for State Inspections. While you'll be provided with a permanent license plate and temp registration on-site, you will need to get the car state inspected within the first two weeks. Schedule this ahead of time. Even more frustrating is that the Model 3, like other Teslas, has special jacking requirements due to the battery underneath. Many traditional auto-repair centers can't/won't service the car because of this, and you should be very cautious about where you take it to ensure your car isn't poorly handled like [/u/bbtow69's poor car was](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/npudzg/is_this_lifted_incorrectly/). Check out this [old Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bxgage/state_inspection_near_devon_pa_service_center/) for some helpful recommendations. The good news (I guess) is that [PA doesn't require an emissions test of electric vehicles](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvspubsforms/BMV/BMV%20Safety%20Inspection%20Bulletins/Safety_Bulletin_BI14-1.pdf).\n\n* If you have the (dis)pleasure of living under PECO's incompetence, they offer you [a whole $50 rebate](https://pecorebateportal.com/electric-vehicles/smart-driver-rebate.html) for your trouble. I'd say go spend it on Phillies tickets, but you should definitely spend it on a [paint repair kit](https://shop.tesla.com/product/paint-repair-kit) instead to cover for [PennDot's mismanagement](https://i.redd.it/576otwicf1t21.jpg) of our roads. More on the *pain* repair kit later.\n\n* Another important note regarding PECO are its peak/off-peak hours. For 2021, the [Super Off-peak hours are Midnight to 6AM, and Peak hours are from 2PM-6PM on weekdays](https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-peco-default-service-tou-rates-time-of-use-20201204.html). A standard rate applies during all other times. **EDIT** This rate does not yet apply, but a plan was proposed and approved in December 2020.\n\n* The Commonwealth itself offers a more substantial BEV incentive of [$750 for new or used vehicles under $50k](https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/grantsloansrebates/alternative-fuels-incentive-grant/pages/alternative-fuel-vehicles.aspx). This is a grant and is not tied to tax returns. However, it's first come, first serve, so get it while you can!\n\n* I had some slight panel misalignment and the plastic trim attached to my passenger-side mirror coming off, noted to the sales rep on delivery day. I didn't realize it, but you also need to separately file a service ticket through the app for this. They ultimately sent out a mobile service tech to fix both, and it was covered under warranty. It took a few weeks to get them out there, so I'd recommend filing the  service ticket on delivery day as soon as you get home.\n\n**The Driving Experience**: So this is (obviously) the best part of owning the car. Here's what I've learned while driving around the area:\n\n* Driving the car with full regen braking is incredibly fun along the winding curves of our area. It feels like a sports car, both in the comfort of the ride and the handling. One pedal driving is especially useful for close curves and hills, and it feels like you have far more control over the vehicle. Because our roads are [a bit special](https://i.redd.it/ypl9rt8y7h571.jpg), you'll likely notice the ride is a bit more bumpy due to the steel spring suspension of the Model 3. While this may be a deal-breaker for those used to a super smooth ride in a luxury vehicle, I've found it to be fine and gives the ride a bit more \"texture\" without the vibration of an ICE engine in front of you. It's simply more noticeable due to the bumpiness of the roads around here, and the potholes can be a bit unnerving. Overall, the car handled these like a champ, and I feel much more in control of my car when driving than I ever did its AWD predecessor. I've heard that potholes can be pretty dangerous for the 19\" and 20\" wheels, so definitely try to avoid those if possible.\n\n* I'd also recommend setting the car to creep or roll for the first hundred miles or so if you aren't used to driving with strong regen braking, as the transition is a bit difficult. Also good to know is that regen braking applies the tail lights at a certain braking threshold, so don't be paranoid like I was and assume you need to apply the brakes as well to avoid getting rear-ended. After you're used to the creep or roll, the transition to \"hold\" will be very smooth and is highly recommended to extend your range.\n\n* Autopilot will work on virtually any road with a median lane marker. Despite actively following Tesla development for nearly a decade, I was under the impression that AP functionality was geofenced to major interstates. Not true. It works on many roads, including rural \"highways\" such as Route 1, but keep in mind that it **will not** stop for stop lights and stop signs like FSD is supposed to. For Route 1 in particular, I wasn't quite ready to let the car handle the high-speed, blind curves around the MD border, so I switched over to manual and had some fun doing the legal speed limit of *55MPH* and still feeling like I'm going too fast. Speaking of country roads, my first major autopilot \"freak out\" occurred when passing an Amish Buggy. While driving on AP, the car saw the Buggy on the right and an oncoming car on the left, and as I drew closer, promptly threw a temper tantrum and kicked me out of AP. Thankfully, I was assuming that the Buggy might cause issues and was already in the process of switching over to manual control. On a later drive through this route without a buggy or oncoming traffic, I discovered that this particular area of road is a hotspot for Phantom Braking, so ultimately it was double-whammy of events. Overall, proceed with the regular amount of caution as you normally would for a buggy.\n\n* I had the joy to discover in late-May that [Tesla had made some important changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31HaTbWONmQ) to my vehicles components after ordering, and would be taking delivery of Tesla-vision vehicle without lumbar support. Outside of my test drive Model 3, I've not had any experiences with a radar-equipped M3, but what I can say is that I've felt quite confident in its ability function in clear conditions. I was also pretty happy to see that the car was receiving updates last week, and appreciated some of the other QOL changes such as the ability to toggle off the auto-brights during autosteer. I'd still prefer being able to outright disable the auto-brights given how bad they are at detection on highways, but for now I think I can deal with the current setup. The lumbar support omission hasn't been much of an issue to my passengers, however I'm still pretty annoyed about the situation.\n\n**Accessories and Other Tidbits**:\n\n* Since we live in a region with, ahem, *Four Seasons*, you'll definitely want to purchase [Splash Guards/Mud Flaps](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-mud-flaps) for your car to [protect the notably poor quality paint](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/55412/tesla-model-3-s-paint-problem-has-a-solution-now/) from salt and gravel spray. It's also recommended to purchase the PPF, but I forgot to add it to my cart that day and can't give a review for it. What I can give a review for are the splash guards and optional mud flaps. The flaps themselves are detachable and hang only about an inch and a half from the ground. I strongly recommend that you don't attach these, as they scrapped along the ground during turns. I have absolutely no idea how Tesla thought these were acceptable to sell to consumers at their current length, but I guess that's what I get for buying a car designed in always sunny, always summer California. The installation process was pretty easy, the only tools needed are a ratchet wrench fitted with a 10MM Hex attachment and a screwdriver to remove the pins on the wheel wells. It took about 20 minutes total to install both, and I'd recommend installing them as soon as you can after deliver to protect from any debris you kick up while driving.\n\n* If you're getting the SR+, the car somehow doesn't come with floor mats despite being a $40K vehicle. Given how many aftermarket floor mats are available, there are a lot of options to choose from. I can't really give a review for the ones I purchased, as I've only had them a month, but I can say you have a wide variety of options to choose from. You'll definitely want to buy something though to protect the car's interior carpet from mud, dirt and basically anything else.\n\n* I purchased a screen protector for my display from [Spigen](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-Designed/dp/B084BNC3FG/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2L662REOLO0LC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=spigen+tesla+model+3+screen+protector&amp;qid=1623845582&amp;sprefix=spigen+tesla%2Caps%2C147&amp;sr=8-2), and it's working pretty well so far. Installation was easy, and the matte anti-glare is largely unnoticeable but protects from smudging.\n\n* Having gotten many dings and scrapes on my previous car in public garages, I decided to purchase a paint repair kit in case it was needed. Frustratingly, in the very first week of ownership, I needed it. I'm not sure how it happened, but at some point my tire  kicked up a piece of debris with enough force that the edge of my rocker around the wheel well was bent-in to the extent that the paint split along a small section around the edge of the rocker where the side meets the wheel well. No matter the cause, the paint repair kit rather was relatively easy to use after watching a number of guides, with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FC0xCixhU0) being the best I could find. A good reason to install the guards as soon as you can, as it presumably would have prevented this damage.\n\n\n* I originally purchased [Silver RIMETRIX Orbitals](https://rimetrix.com/product/orbital-silver/) for my car because I wanted something a bit more flashy than the aero wheels. The plan was to buy them, then coat them with Duplicolor [Hyper Silver](https://www.duplicolor.com/product/hyper-silver-coating/) to give them a metallic finish that would reduce their plastics look. After owning the car for a few weeks, I actually found the Aeros to look just fine and cancelled my order. I may come back to the orbitals, but for now I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite dreaming of owning a Tesla for nearly a decade and following them very closely since the early Model S days, I started to get cold feet as delivery day approached and the Tesla vision announcement was made. I wound up taking delivery anyway, and I'm incredible happy that I did. The car handles exceptionally, is very intuitive to use, and most importantly, I just love looking at it and knowing its all mine. If you're in the same spot that I was, I hope this review gives you a bit more insight into a number of steps in this process, as well as some of the quirks and benefits of owning a Tesla in our area.

      "text": "Don't flame, I know this is a Tesla forum, I own (and mostly love) my Model 3.\n\nBut seriously, what is GM smoking?  I thought this was a late April fools day joke.  The only EV's that GM is really selling are the Bolts.

But it really seems like the legacy automakers are unable to compete.  Even Toyota is \"outsourcing\" much of their BEV product line to BYD.\n\nVW is trying hard.  But their software has been so bad.\n\nAside from Hyundai/Kia, BYD, and few others in Asia, it seems like Tesla is the only BEV MFG with its head in the game.\n\nI had great hopes for Ford, who seemed like they were making good choices (initially) with the Mustang and F150.

      "text": "Earlier today, the EU voted to increase the import tax on vehicles produced in China, amongst which is the new model 3 Highland.\n\n  \nTo summarize, the Chinese government has been heavily subsidizing (B)EV companies that originate in China. To combat an unfair playground for European based manufacturers, the EU has inflated the import tax. The individual duties applying to the three sampled Chinese producers are:\n\n&gt;**BYD: 17.4%;**\n\n&gt;**Geely: 19.9%;**\n\n&gt;**SAIC: 37.6%.**\n\n&gt;Other BEV producers in China, which **cooperated in the investigation but were not sampled**, are subject to the **20.8%** weighted average duty. The duty for other **non-cooperating companies** is **37.6%**.\n\n**What does this mean for Tesla?**\n\nTesla claims (Source: Spoke to multiple Tesla employees regarding this subject) they do not receive any benefit besides lower labour costs. Tesla has requested a custom rate, in line with the benefits they receive by building the M3 in China.\n\n&gt;Following a substantiated request, one BEV producer in China \u0013 Tesla \u0013 may receive an individually calculated duty rate at the definitive stage. Any other company producing in China not selected in the final sample that wishes to have its particular situation investigated can ask for an accelerated review, in line with the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, just after imposition of definitive measures. The deadline for concluding such a review is 9 months since its request.\n\nAs of right now, it looks like Tesla will receive the same initial import tax all other companies besides BYD, Geely and SAIC get. However, it may change in the future.\n\nThe Tesla representatives I spoke to ensured me the price will not increase by the same ammount as the import tax, would'nt dare speculate about it either - Which is why I'm posting this.\n\n  \n**How much (If any) price increase (in %) do you expect the M3 to receive?**\n\n&gt;  \nSource: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/nl/ip\\_24\\_3630](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/nl/ip_24_3630)",

      "text": "I\u0019ve been an owner of a \u001818 Chevy Volt since April 2019 with very few issues, it\u0019s been very dependable, efficient, and fun.  With parts availability (EGR valve and front struts are extremely hard to locate, and pricey).\nI now work from home and did from 2020 to say, 2022-23 when we went hybrid; it only has 36k+ miles and is in great condition.  \n\nQuestion: I found a good deal on a \u001822 M3 LR AWD and am considering buying it, going full on BEV and retaining my Volt, and  selling another vehicle to help pay for the Tesla.  I have home charging capabilities for the Volt and M3.  I\u0019m torn due to this having the appearance of an (expensive) impulse purchase, yet I\u0019ve been thinking about it for years now.  (The Volt is often referred to as a gateway car/drug to full BEV.). Then the thought of PHEV and BEVs range degrading over time (not so much on miles).  Does anyone think this is a silly thought to purchase this Tesla, which I could manage w/o financing?  Another thought is EV battery tech continuing to improve range and lower cost, with the upcoming M2 as a possible example, although one would never buy a BEV as its technology will always continue to improve range and cost!\n\nLooking very forward to joining the Tesla family, just questioning when.  Lastly, the nearest Tesla service center is an approximately 2.5 hour drive from here.  Would Tesla have a mobile team that would drive that far to provide service?\n\nIn years to come, could sell the Volt (preferably) if my experience with the Tesla is positive.  Lastly, I\u0019d be purchasing this Tesla from another automaker\u0019s dealership across the country, so buying based on pictures and taking the word of the salesperson indicating its great condition and low miles.\n\nThanks to all in helping me to jump to one side of the fence or the other. \n\nTLDR: found a super nice, low mileage Model 3 LR AWD.

      "text": "I\u0019ve owned my 2023 M3 RWD for one month. I\u0019m here in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures average 40-50 F this time of year.  I\u0019ve noticed that the green circle symbol (limited regenerative braking) is on nearly all the time. \n\nThis is different from my experience with PHEVs (Honda Clarity) and BEVs (Ford Mach E) in the past, which would limit regenerative braking at very cold temps (eg below 40 F) but generally be ok above 40. \n\nOn the same routes I commonly drive, with a few mild hills, my model 3 will have barely any regen and cannot use one pedal driving (without engaging the regular brakes), while other electric vehicles I\u0019ve experienced can use regeneration on these routes and at these temperatures. \n\nI contacted Tesla and received a call back saying that while Tesla does not publish a spec for \u001ccold\u001d which limits regen, the tech on the phone said any battery temp below 70F will limit regen. Do others have a similar experience or receive similar info? \n\nI am very surprised to learn that the Tesla regenerative braking system may not be as robust as that of Honda or Ford (or other manufacturers). I am still wondering if my car has some defect causing more severe limitation to regen that normal, though Tesla says their remote analysis of car data indicates my car is normal. If that\u0019s true, I guess there may be nothing to fix or change, but I will be very disappointed if the car cannot regen for 9 months out of the year in the climate I live in (cool, but definitely not cold), while models from Honda and Ford and others have no issue.",

The idea is to objectively evaluate  the buy decision to go BEV vs ICE. At this point, EVs remain a luxury for the average person.\n\nToday, EVs make up less than \\~1.5% of total cars on the road. Thanks to induced demand due to blind government policies is going to make sure everyone will be riding a bike in the not far future.\n\nI am all for electrification provided it makes sense, what ever your reason, be it financial, environmental or pure bragging rights.\n\nIt's easy to focus on the fuel costs and push one opinion. However, for sake of the analysis the breakeven point for ICE vs BEV  happens @ 54.4¢/kWh\n\nIn California, for example, average kWh cost 30¢/kWh and with the current trajectory, it wont' take time before it hit 60¢/kWh...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT#2:**\n\n\\- added Chevy Bolt for those who are looking at other EV option\n\n\\- At face value, the Bolt comes on par with Corolla. However, this is only because of blind government policies and subsidies using your tax dollars. Those incentives are not going to last long.\n\n\\- Today, battery (65kWh) replacement cost would run you \\~17.5k cad\n\n\\- Battery costs and EVs are likely to increase over the next decade. Thanks to EVs rush.\n\nif you divide battery replacement cost  by average annual fuel cost for ICE you get\n\n17.5k/ 2.5k = 7 years pretty much negating any fuel savings\n\n\\- We have not discussed infrastructure bottleneck, grid capacity, MPU for Level 2 charger, inter-city travel, recycle waste, supply chain, geo-political issues, and the list goes on...\n\n\\- All to say, the cost of electricity is likely to sky rocket. So yes, enjoy EVs while you can\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT#3:**\n\nI am not suggesting 0.251 kWh/km is the EV's efficiency.\n\nThe EV efficiency is pretty much constant, i.e. in the case of Tesla it is the available usable capacity (kWh) divide by Range (km)\n\n57.5kWh/438km = 0.131 kWh/km\n\nNow, batteries do age over their lifetime @ \\~4.3%, this means, over the course of it's lifetime, you need to charge your battery more to squeeze the same mileage.\n\nCharging efficiency varies from install to install depending on cable run length and available voltage. A typical Level 2 charger can reach +90% efficiency.\n\nif you take your electricity consumption to charge the battery and divide by the odometer reading, you are going to be closer to 0.250kWh/km. Of course, this assumes you are charging at home.\n\n0.250kWh/km is what it will end up costing you to charge your car\n\nsee this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/152eouj/comment/jshdcmo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for more details\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT#4:**\n\nHere is a real life experience of BEV [WTF moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/158beq7/what_did_i_do_wrong_i_left_it_in_office_garage/)\n\nHere is a [real-life trip of 2,200 miles](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/15pkrga/comment/jw2bonk/)  and charging costs vs fueling costs\n\naverage efficiency:\n\n601kWh/2200mi = 0.272kWh/mi = 0.170kWh/km\n\naverage charging costs:\n\n$223.71/ 601kWh = 37.2 cent/kWh\n\nin contrast, a comparable ICE with 40MPG HWY fuel efficiency\n\n2200mi / 40mpg = 55 gallons\n\n$223.71 / 55gal = $4.05/gal which is slightly more than average gasoline costs of $3.94/gal at the time of the trip\n\n[https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\\_gas\\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nI am all for Electrification and EVs.

Maybe Tesla can leverage its Solar installers nation wide?\n\n* Free supercharger (X miles, X credit, X months, X years, or FUSC for life)\n\n* Extend the bumper to bumper warranty to 10 year / 150k miles to match Toyota and other brands?\n\n* Keep permanently slashing MSRP?\n\n* Paywall/software lock features and lower the starting MSRP at all trim levels but include all parts on vehicle at time of sale?\n\n* Sell only bare bones cars and offer a retrofit for all features like how German cars can be customized physically.\n\n* Refresh the line up so that Tesla can retrofit add more packs/modules into a \"starter\" package car after sale. This way your initial cost can be very slimmed down to a 100 mile range BEV (or less) and you add/rent/lease modules later >/\n\n* Add a new program for extended warranties as a cash grab.\n\n* Create 0% financing for 84 months where the int is already baked into the MSRP.

      "text": "Liked our first Tesla so much we got a second one following week\n\nLeased myself a model 3 and traded in my Kia K5. After we test drove one at the mall because we arrived for our dinner reservation too early, we fell in love and I wanted to get the updated model 3. I really wasn\u0019t a fan of the model Y but wife preferred the size and compared it to our aging 2015 X5 in size pretty well. Kids loved the entertainment display in the rear of model 3.\n\nWent back the following day and secured a model 3 and picked it up 2 days later. I already had a 240v connection from a Chevy volt almost 10 years ago so didn\u0019t need anything extra.\n\nDue to me getting a possible new job that is 100 miles round trip, we realized the lease won\u0019t cut it. Test drove a few PHEV cars but honestly that Tesla model 3 just spoiled us&\n\nWent online, found a model y that wife liked and ordered that. She got the color and style she wanted and I got my little model 3.\n\nPretty wild within a week we just went from 2 ICE vehicles to all EV. lol\n\nCurious to see how it pans out. \n\nWe don\u0019t do too much long distance driving and honestly there are SO many supercharging stations around here, I\u0019m not worried at all.\n\nAnyways just wanted to share. Excited for something new.\n\nAlso getting on the FPL\u0019s evolution thing where they come install a level 2 charger for free in your house and for $38 a month (locked in rate for 10 years, then you own it) you get unlimited off peak and weekend charging. That\u0019s a good deal for 2 cars!\n\nI\u0019ll post the cars when we get them!",

      "text": "**If you don't like reading long posts, you can read the parts in bold and skip the rest!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been a very satisfied Chevrolet Volt owner for the past 6 years, and since GM announced the end of that nameplate I have been considering Teslas to replace.  I've spent the past several months building a budget and considering everything from a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, to a used Model S, to eventually the Model 3.  I didn't think the Model 3 was for me until I was pushed to take a test drive while checking out the Model S in a store, and I fell in love.  I'm glad to hear that Tesla is easing back on plans to close most stores because doing so might have caused them to miss out on business from a customer like me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter lots of careful consideration I'm at the point where I'm ready to put in a reservation tomorrow, and I'm down to one of two choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I am decided on getting a Long Range Model 3, Midnight Silver Metallic, with the 18\" Aero Wheels, and at least the $3k Autopilot option.  I'm now trying to decide between:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **a Dual-motor without Full Self Driving (price before delivery and taxes at $51,500).**\n2. **a RWD with Full Self Driving (price before delivery and taxes at $52,500).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I could afford to do both FSD and dual-motors, I can't justify the cost to myself.  My commute is \\~20 miles each direction with a mix of surface streets, crowded multi-lane tollway that can average 80mph or 15mph depending on day and time, and state highways with signalized intersections.  I'm a commercial realtor by trade, so there will be some days when the long-range will be important as I skip back and forth across sprawling Houston, Texas.  Obviously, snow/ice is only a consideration here typically 1-2 days each year.  I don't go on long road trips often, but I will occasionally drive 100-300 miles to nearby major cities for work and to visit with friends.  I do have excellent charging options, including:  a 14-50 plug at home, a private 4.8kW charger at work, and a supercharger about 3 blocks from home, and another one located about 6 miles from my office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen thinking about the difference between DM w/o FSD vs. RWD w/ FSD, I am cognizant of:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Resale value in 5-7 years of either the 2nd motor or the included software upgrade and/or possibly HW3 retrofit?\n2. Whether I would be able to really feel the difference in speed of the DM vs. RWD?\n3. Whether a 2nd motor enhances reliability or creates an additional failure point?\n4. That .5 seconds of 0-60 and \\~1 second in the standing 1/4-mile...\n5. Those \\~15 miles of range...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife says, do what makes you happy.  Trying to decide which will put a bigger smile on my face -- dropping a half-second off of the 0-60 or letting my car do the heavy lifting in rush-hour traffic?  Talk about 1st world problems...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**As with any post I make seeking advice, I will appreciate any and all:  questions, comments, thoughts, references, rants, and advice.**",

      "text": "I pulled the trigger on putting down a deposit for a new Model 3 Highland a few weeks after the official reveal. Have been thinking of EVs for awhile but the price tag and design have always been major deterrents. Tesla Model 3 pricing in my country was super compelling, at half the price of similarly spec-ed EVs, mainly due to tax benefits. After watching a few videos on youtube and some quick research, decided to pull the trigger. \n\nFor context, I do enjoy driving, but not necessarily an enthusiast. Currently own a G20 BMW 330i, and used to own a PHEV F30 BMW 330e. My current car does put a smile to my space when I floor it from time to time. The planted feeling when cornering in my BMW at high speeds feels amazing. Just some of the few reasons why \n\nThe main reason for my decision to switch to an EV is mainly for fuel savings. My beamer is quite the gas-guzzler, and my estimations put fuel savings at a few hundred bucks a month. I am able to install a charger at home (which Tesla is giving out for free), so I won't have to rely on public chargers.\n\nAnd the second reason being that at the price, the Tesla Model 3 appears to offer quite compelling value, considering the Highland's upgrades all around. Of course I have reservations - no stalks (not exactly a dealbreaker I guess) and no USS! (most worried about this, but I pray software can improve its reliability). Also not to mention any issues that could be discovered with this facelift version as more drivers test it in the real-world. \n\nAs I am approaching delivery day, I am oscillating between excitement (new car, first EV, novelty of a Tesla) and buyer's remorse (EV???, downgrade in terms of build quality?, no USS!). \n\nThoughts would be helpful, but I most likely will go through with it. \n\nWill do an update on delivery and my first 1000 km!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nBackstory:\n\nI owned an 18 M3LR for a bit a few years back but wife wanted to upgrade to a MY for the extra room. She wanted it to be our family car and we have a big dog + a kid on the way at the time. Bought a brand new MYP in early 22 and loved it. Once the wife got used to driving it she was going to use it as her daily, we would sell her loaded new Rav4 and get a beater for the 2nd car to save money. I work from home so we wouldn't need a nice 2nd car and the MYP scratched my itch for driving something fun.\n\nAnyway wife never got used to Tesla. She could drive it but could never get used to the looks,comments, etc. She said people treated it as if it was super fancy look at Mrs moneybags. I could never understand it since most new trucks/SUVs these days are more expensive than a Tesla but I couldn't change her mind.\n\nSo to get a bigger family car for now 2 kids+big dog+ something she was comfortable in we traded in the MYP for a new Sorrento PHEV. She's happy, we have the nice \"big\" family trip car.\n\nI now drive kids to daycare every morning so I do have a little bit of a commute if you can call it that. I am now driving her Rav4 and for someone who likes to drive and likes to enjoy what they drive this SUV sucks. It has no personality. It is a very reliable car so when I say sucks, I mean it sucks for someone like me who wants to have fun after the kids are dropped off and I am driving home.\n\nI want to trade it in for something more fun to drive. I have a hard price cap which rules out buying a new Tesla again. But I have found a couple used 2020 M3Ps with about 40-50k miles on them in my price range.\n\nTL:DR For a person who only put 12000 miles total on their MYP in 2ish years is buying a used 2020 M3P with 40-50k miles a bad idea?\n\nI know the smart thing to do would be to trade in the Rav4 for a used Camry/Accord/etc. but I just can't.\n\nThanks",

      "text": "Have enjoyed our MYLR and the 16k miles we've put on it since we got it in January, but my wife drives it to work, so I'm relegated to nighttime and weekend errand runs.  I'm ready to retire my compliance PHEV and add a second Tesla.  Don't need two SUVs and sounds like the M3 is even more fun to drive than the MY. Budgeting for $30k or less and have found a few local possibilities.  The one I'm looking most closely at is an '18 M3LR, 50k miles, with Acceleration Boost and FSD for just under $30k.  Hoping to hear from people who've had experience in both an older M3 and a newer MY as to whether there's anything about the older M3's that would be a big downgrade to the newer MY.  I know I'll lose the double-paned windows, and the '18 won't have a heat pump.  I live in FL so that's not a deal breaker to me.  Any other major changes to the M3 in the past 4-5 years that I should be aware of?  Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "I\u0019ve owned my 2023 M3 RWD for one month. I\u0019m here in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures average 40-50 F this time of year.  I\u0019ve noticed that the green circle symbol (limited regenerative braking) is on nearly all the time. \n\nThis is different from my experience with PHEVs (Honda Clarity) and BEVs (Ford Mach E) in the past, which would limit regenerative braking at very cold temps (eg below 40 F) but generally be ok above 40. \n\nOn the same routes I commonly drive, with a few mild hills, my model 3 will have barely any regen and cannot use one pedal driving (without engaging the regular brakes), while other electric vehicles I\u0019ve experienced can use regeneration on these routes and at these temperatures. \n\nI contacted Tesla and received a call back saying that while Tesla does not publish a spec for \u001ccold\u001d which limits regen, the tech on the phone said any battery temp below 70F will limit regen. Do others have a similar experience or receive similar info? \n\nI am very surprised to learn that the Tesla regenerative braking system may not be as robust as that of Honda or Ford (or other manufacturers). I am still wondering if my car has some defect causing more severe limitation to regen that normal, though Tesla says their remote analysis of car data indicates my car is normal. If that\u0019s true, I guess there may be nothing to fix or change, but I will be very disappointed if the car cannot regen for 9 months out of the year in the climate I live in (cool, but definitely not cold), while models from Honda and Ford and others have no issue.",

But before all that happened, this wasn't the first time poor Scarjo got beat up a bit. Well ok, a LOT. She had both front and back doors changed on the driver side and passenger side quarter and rocker needed some work 2 weeks in (stupid bus).\n\nFlash forward and I am very close to pulling the trigger on a Highland LR AWD. I am in Canada. The weather is brutal at times, but thankfully i park overnight in my garage during winter months. We're a family of 4, and this is the main car, but we are almost 4 drivers now, and while my daughter likes driving the PHEV more, my wife will still have access to the Tesla, and eventually my son too i guess, unless i relegate him to the PHEV only as well. \n\nHow resilient is PPF for everyday scuffs and stuff like that? I mentioned i park inside, but it's tight, so people rub against the car sometimes when they go by it. We brush the car with snow brushes in winter. All the things you'd expect. Aside from having to replace a complete panel in the case of an accident, what has been your experience with PPF. Would you do it again? Did you find it worth it? \n\nI am looing at UPPF in like a Gold/Green or something cool like that, which would save me $2600 by going with basic stealth grey instead of the Red I was going to go with. Then do you ceramic on top? It's supposed to be oleophobic, so cleanup should be easy with way. Does colored PPF lose it's shine with time more than paint would? I can't imagine you can bring back the luster like you can with paint.\n\nTIA ",

With parts availability (EGR valve and front struts are extremely hard to locate, and pricey).\nI now work from home and did from 2020 to say, 2022-23 when we went hybrid; it only has 36k+ miles and is in great condition.  \n\nQuestion: I found a good deal on a \u001822 M3 LR AWD and am considering buying it, going full on BEV and retaining my Volt, and  selling another vehicle to help pay for the Tesla.  I have home charging capabilities for the Volt and M3.  I\u0019m torn due to this having the appearance of an (expensive) impulse purchase, yet I\u0019ve been thinking about it for years now.  (The Volt is often referred to as a gateway car/drug to full BEV.). Then the thought of PHEV and BEVs range degrading over time (not so much on miles).  Does anyone think this is a silly thought to purchase this Tesla, which I could manage w/o financing?  Another thought is EV battery tech continuing to improve range and lower cost, with the upcoming M2 as a possible example, although one would never buy a BEV as its technology will always continue to improve range and cost!\n\nLooking very forward to joining the Tesla family, just questioning when.  Lastly, the nearest Tesla service center is an approximately 2.5 hour drive from here.  Would Tesla have a mobile team that would drive that far to provide service?\n\nIn years to come, could sell the Volt (preferably) if my experience with the Tesla is positive.  Lastly, I\u0019d be purchasing this Tesla from another automaker\u0019s dealership across the country, so buying based on pictures and taking the word of the salesperson indicating its great condition and low miles.\n\nThanks to all in helping me to jump to one side of the fence or the other. \n\nTLDR: found a super nice, low mileage Model 3 LR AWD.

      "text": "Hi! I'm comming from a PHEV BMW 330e and I did a testdrive recently. Driving the M3 felt very much like driving a Miata (and eletric one): fun drive, very responsive and nervous car, although not the most confortable one - but I can live with that, I owned a Miata and loved the car.\n\nA few things are a big uncomfortable for me in this likely switch, and I'm wondering if I'm seeing in correctly:\n\n1) There is no front camera view! I usually sit low in cars and often I can't see if there is some sidewalk or any other obstacle in from of the car (for example in an indoor parking lot or when coming up a ramp). I understand Teslas have this Parking aid that shows the obstacles. Is this reliable? It is enough to \"see\" obstacle or does it misses some of the obstacles? Any workaround to see the camera (I know the camera is there somewhere and Sentry is able to record it...)\n\n2) There is no \"Limit speed\" setting. In my current car I can tell it \"drive up to 30mph\", and I still keep full control of the speed. The car just makes sure I can't go faster than 30mph (as an example). I use this very often due to speed radars - when one is advertised, I set the limit to the speed limit and forget it is there. I know that autopilot can help with this, but often in these situations I like to keep \"manual control\" of the speed (which I think I can't do with autopilot). Am I missing something?\n\n3) No waze. I can even believe that the maps in the car are fantastic (didn't seam in the testdrive, but anyway), but was had mobile radars info, and that is crucial. I know there are some aftermarket solutions for applecar play (which includes obviously waze) - any of them work \"reasonable well\"?\n\n4) Comfort felt worse than in the bmw (although is has the M kit). Suspension just felt less absorbing, but I could be wrong... any simular switching experiences?\n\n  \nThank you! ",

      "text": "I thought I\u0019d share my experience on owning my first EV after considering a purchase for nearly two years.\n\nI\u0019m finding that \u001cRange Anxiety\u001d is mostly a concern prior to acquiring the vehicle. Now that I have one I quickly realize that nearly every outlet is your own personal gas station. I\u0019ve just gotten my level 2 wall charger installed and it hasn\u0019t been a big issue as I get free charging at work, but having it certainly helps.\n\nNow that I\u0019ve taken some vacation and driven to a destination just at the edge of my range I feel like I\u0019ve gotten a pretty good understanding of what the state of charging is like currently.  Public charging and super charging are still cheaper than the gas equivalent.  So far I\u0019m estimating a 3.6 m/kWh. I\u0019ve spent 57.75 on charging and gotten 165 kWhs out of that at .35¢ per. That\u0019s the equivalent of 594 miles for a little more than a tank full of premium or roughly 1/2 the cost of what I was paying prior. And with home charging being even cheaper, this so far is a big win. Lastly I feel like the LFP battery has a lot of pluses that get overlooked and not having to treat it like a lithium battery is nice. \n \nOwning a Tesla has been pretty neat and while this was not always my first choice (I actually had a deposit on an MME) I am officially a convert.  The buying process, even with a trade in, was amazing. The car is designed from the ground up as an EV and that shows in some different ways. The cargo space is amazing.  The M3 is a sedan that feels like a wagon with all the cargo space. It drives very well and is not as noisy (I find) as is often said. The build quality seems fairly decent so far. Autopilot on longer drives a great. Despite being single motor the SR has plenty of punch out of the gate and is easily faster than my 2.0L Audi A3 w a stage 1 tune was.  It really is a dream to drive.\n\nNow for some of the not so great stuff. I\u0019m not a huge fan of having so many standard features hidden in a menu on a screen. It\u0019s temptingly distracting and takes some getting used to. The paint on the M3 is clearly not like other cars. The considerations around cleaning and the fact that the door wells are not fully painted are certainly minuses.\n\nOverall though the pluses far outweigh the minus and I\u0019m glad I finally made the move and decided on this vehicle.  The prices have been crazy the last two years and now seemed like a good time to buy.",

I live in the SFV so I don\u0019t need to drive super far for any of my basic needs/wants. \n\nI have a job that requires I drive a lot which is where the update will help. I also drive to Visalia every so often and want to get there in one go without panicking about the battery life and watching my speed all the time to make sure I am using the energy wisely.

There are other incentives to this but I am primarily upgrading because of the miles!\n\nThe upgrade was $2,190 w/ CA Tax. \nI think it\u0019s worth it but it will take up to 3 business days before they send the update to my vehicle. I was told there would be about a 3 hour software update time, so i will probably update over night. \n\nI am good about keeping the battery between 70-80 percent and hardly charge to 100%. \n\nI really enjoy my SR, even with all the driving I do, it still lasts.

      "text": "A friend of mine has a retail business that, partly due to the pandemic, has a very high demand for deliveries.  So he asked me if I would like to help him out doing deliveries for the next few days (including today).  I have a few days off from my regular job, so I figured I could help him out and make a few bucks at the same time.  The other perk, which I realized today, was that I was getting paid to drive my car all day.  So a win-win all around.\n\nBut doing this today, I realized what a great delivery vehicle the Model 3 is (really, most any EV).  The deliveries are all in urban areas, lots of stop and go with very little highway driving.  So my efficiency was pretty good.   Also, I have done this type of driving before in ICE vehicles and never liked it.  Speed up, hit the brakes, stop for a traffic light, accelerate again, stop sign.  Just constantly back and forth between the gas and brake pedal.  With the Model 3 and Hold Mode on, I rarely took my foot off the accelerator.\n\nThen with an ICE vehicle, do you shut off the engine when you get out to make a delivery or keep the motor running?  Not even something you think about in an EV.\n\nAfter each stop, I then had to look at the next deliveries to decide which one to do next, which route to take, etc.  Again, no idling. \n\nThen, it was fairly warm today in the Northeast.  An ICE vehicle would have had a lot of heat coming off it, which would have made it even warmer getting in and out of the car.  I am sure my electric motors heated up somewhat, but nothing that I could feel getting in and out, or sitting with my windows open planning my route.\n\nFinally, I get to drive my car about 5-6 hours, listening to Spotify and podcasts.  I wonder if he needs someone full time?\n\nDefinitely looking forward to the next two days of deliveries.",

      "title": "Review of 2019SR+ vs. 2023M3P",
      "text": "I\u0019ve had the chance to drive my performance now for a couple weeks, here\u0019s my comparison of the two. For reference I put 90,000 miles in 3 years on the 2019SR+. I put SR below for ease of typing. \n\n\n**Paint** :The paint on my SR was not great, it\u0019s solid black and there was parts missed all over the frunk and trunk. There was a noticeable amount of rock chips due to daily highway driving. The P has those areas covered nicely, much better attention to detail. I don\u0019t know much else about paint so yeah.  \n\n\n**Fit/finish** : I have never paid too much attention to panel alignment, the SR however had some issues on the A frame and on the trunk alignment. It took effort to see though so it\u0019s not something I ever pursued fixing. The P on the other hand is at least an 8/10 as far as panels being aligned and glass being correctly placed. The interior in the P is no longer squeaky and cheap, center console and cupholders are solid. I like the slidey console now. The interior lights are new to me since the SR is a bargain bin version. No big opinion on those, it\u0019s neat. Also I have fog lights which is nice.   \n\n\n**Range** : Since the P comes with a heat pump and other battery and system related improvements, my range seems to be much closer to what the EPA says. It\u0019s only been 2 weeks so I won\u0019t fool myself but, taking into account degradation at 10% I could still get 280 miles from this car according to the Stats app and tesla app. My SR would get 100 miles on a great day, from the 240 EPA estimation on my window sticker. I know the long range would have been better for range but this will do.    \n\n\nWe took a road trip from NorCal to socal and had to stop 6-7 times to charge in my SR. Looking at only a few in the Performance. Maybe less if I throw 18\u001d wheels on it.   \n\n\n**Driving** : Driving between the two cars is about the same, the acceleration is zippy due to instant torque and the brakes are brakes. Holy crap driving this car is like having a roller coaster at your finger tips. Going from an SR (with the 980 motor ~5.5 sec to 60mph) to a 2023 Performance with the older battery so faster acceleration, is ballistic. I was a quick little car, launching felt like a quick take off and traffic was always a couple cars behind. The P is bonkers, 3.1ish 0-60mph just makes every drive fun. The suspension on the P is stiffer and the ride is more rough due to the bigger wheels. It certainly corners much better and did some great turns on a mountain road the other day.  \nThe lack of USS, all I can say is, there is only room for improvement when it comes to \u001cvision\u001d. \n\n\n**Software/operation**:  This was not a selling point for me, nor was it something I considered would be updated. On the SR, YouTube and browser, dashcam viewer and most video services were unusable and just slow/unresponsive. The Performance has a Ryzen processor which is just so fast and has no input lag or sluggishness. Everything opens and closes with ease. Having more speakers is cool and so is a subwoofer. Haven\u0019t had a subwoofer since my 1996 Honda accord, before it was stolen the first time& and stripped. \n\n\n**Other**:  Not terribly thrilled that I now have to convert all of my USB charging devices to usb-c but I know I\u0019m a dinosaur and they charge faster. The charge port is much quieter now and has a smooth schwoop instead of a clunk and some mechanized sounds. Powered trunk is a luxury I never considered but it\u0019s handy.  I like the wireless charging, on the SR you had to buy parts and install the stuff to enable wireless charging. And it sucked.  Bluetooth key seems just as clunky as it has always been. I\u0019ve tried every fix, it is what it is. Seat belts are snappier, whatever that means. Rear seat heaters I could take or leave but the heated steering wheel is probably never going to be turned off, I love it. Financing is more convenient now, it\u0019s just all through the app, the SR was through tesla but it requires login to a website to view/pay.   \n\n2019 SR+ specific items:\n**Issues** : I\u0019ll split this into two sections as I feel that is important, intentional and accidental\nIntentional - drained 2 separate 12v batteries $230 and service each time.\nIntentional - broken heater $1,600\nAccidental - flat tire $0 (towed free to les Schwab, yes you can do that if you use les Schwab/ any shop within 50 miles or so. \nIntentional - broken fog light (lol) on the driver side. I laugh because it\u0019s not even connected so I lost some plastic. \nAccidental - our wonderfully aerodynamic cars are just rock magnets, I\u0019ve replaced the windshield twice and now need it again in 3 years. \n\n**Acessories**: window glass and door seals to reduce wind noise, reduced noise slightly. \nRoof and rear glass shades, from Basenor, highly recommend with the added reflective shield. Black tesla in California is not fun, the shades are life savers and don\u0019t use adhesive or any magnets. I had to chrome delete the 2019 which was fine until the mirrors. Nope. \nI went through a couple sets of interior LED lights and underglow, I can\u0019t recommend any of them enough to put here. The ones I\u0019ve posted before have since been removed due to electrical issues (RIP 12v twice). I elected to self tint because I make bad decisions, don\u0019t do this. \n\n\n\nThanks for reading! I think I covered all of my recent observations",

      "title": "Model 3 vs Bolt EUV LT",
      "text": " Hey guys! So my dad was looking to buy an electric car given he already has a gas SUV(Rogue). He was interested in either of the two above and wanted me to do a bit of research before he bought one. Generally, I figured the Bolt was quite a bit cheaper, almost $15k less than a M3. But when I looked at my local Chevy dealerships, they mentioned some ongoing GM strike to justify a $4000 markup on the EUV LT. Now after some discussion, I was able to bring it down to $2k, leaving me at $30k MSRP, and add in registration and other fees, etc., it leaves me at around $33k out of the gate. The M3 on the other hand is at a discount than its usual MSRP, currently at only $37k ($4k less than MSRP) near my local dealership. Inclusive of all other fees and the discounts offered by the referral program would approximately leave me around $38k. Since I live in NJ, both the vehicles are exempt from state tax and also qualify for both the federal $7.5k tax credit as well as the $4k credit from the NJ state.\n\nSubtracting the tax credit from the respective MSRPs leaves me at around $21,500 for the bolt and $26,500 for the M3. One of the bolt's primary appeals was its cheaper price tag but given there is now only a $5k difference between both the cars, I'm in a dilemma over which to suggest to my dad. The M3 is the better car but it was never $15k-20k better than the Bolt EUV. But is it worth going the distance for only $5k more?",

      "title": "Three months with 2022 Model 3 RWD",
      "text": "**TLDR**\n\nAfter 3 months of owning the 2022 Model 3 RWD, I really enjoy the EV despite frustrating build quality, business practices, and technical support by Tesla. At the same time, those shortcomings will no doubt drive me to at least consider alternatives to Tesla when I am looking for a new car again in a decade. Now let the irrational fanboys descend with accusations of me being some ICE shill!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Use Case**\n\nHow we utilize our vehicles can significantly affect our overall satisfaction with said cars. In my case, I use this car as my daily driver and travel fairly short distances 95% of the time. My typical day involves a round trip of almost 13 miles and drains just about 10% of the battery and span 1 tollway plus 2 long streets. This puts my efficiency squarely as reported. My workplace offers complimentary charging  so I almost never charge at home, making my \"fuel\" costs essentially 0. Needless to say, I have been very happy with the M3 as my mode of transportation.\n\n**Driving Experience**\n\nMy driving experience has overall been a good one thus far. Choosing the M3 RWD was actually a deliberate decision as I could definitely afford a Model S. Thing is, I knew I didn't need the adrenaline pumping acceleration of the LR and beyond for even the M3 and that it would only get me in trouble with tickets. The RWD accelerates rapidly but smoothly and despite being the slowest of the Tesla family, already offers me far more speed than any car I have personally owned which lets me overtake cars when passing with much greater ease and safety. My previous Lexus ES350 might as well be a snail in comparison in terms of performance. Simply put, the RWD's performance makes it a joy to drive.\n\nWith that said however, the ride quality is pretty horrendous. I don't know if it's the quality of the suspensions or its tuning (maybe a combination of both), but the ride quality of the RWD is jarring. This is especially so coming from the ES350's super smooth ride. You keenly feel every bump. Some might argue that sporty cars naturally have stiff suspensions, but there is a difference between feeling stiff (say a Infiniti Q50) and feeling brittle. The Tesla's ride quality is clearly in the latter camp for me. In fact, I would say that the ride quality is so disappointing, that I am considering installing an aftermarket suspension.\n\n**Cabin Noise**\n\nThis bleeds into build quality and design, but the RWD (at least the one I have) is by far the loudest car I have personally owned. There is ever present wind sound from the driver window, some unknown rattling from the passenger side and overall, copious amounts of tire and road noise. Even when the music is banging, I can still hear the above mentioned noises. My ES350 was basically silent in comparison. When I took it in less than a week after delivery pickup and drove with the technician, they successfully identified the noise and then informed me that they would do nothing about it. In their words, it is a characteristic of their frameless design. Sorry, but I call BS on that. I've been in cars with frameless designs and none were comparable.\n\n**Build Quality**\n\nI get that Tesla went for a minimalistic design. However, there is a difference between minimalistic and cheap, which is territory that Tesla crosses into quite often. If the driving experience of other cars is very underwhelming compared to the RWD, then the RWD's build quality is very underwhelming in comparison to other cars. It is not put together as carefully; uneven panel gaps, slightly uncurled edges, thin carpet, and a both uneven and chip prone paint job. Even worse, unlike every other auto manufacturer on the planet, Tesla does not offer a la carte upgrade options for things like better audio or footwell lighting. It's pretty crazy!\n\n**Accessories &amp; Modifications**\n\nWith the build quality and factory upgrade options being as disappointing as they were, the plethora of aftermarket accessories and modifications available for Teslas really helps things out. To date, I have added the following accessories and modifications to my RWD.\n\n* Hansshow Dashboard Hidden HUD\n* XPEL XR+ tinting to all areas glass\n* XPEL Ultimate Plus PPF on the front\n* Katzkin pearl colored genuine leather seat covers\n* Katzkin gel-infused ventilated seat cushions\n* Katzkin Degreez cooling system for the driver seat\n* Taptes all-weather liners\n* Speck anti-glare screen protector\n* Front center console USB hub\n* Side door trash can\n* Backseat trash bag\n* Front cupholder inserts\n* Harnessed trunk organizer\n* Portable tire air pump\n\nWhile not all essential, these aftermarket upgrades have really upped the RWD's quality of life for me. It's a shame that none of that extra money went to Tesla though.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nWith everything said and done, I do really like the RWD. This is in spite of Tesla's cheap (and borderline deceitful) business decisions and the sheer unhelpfulness of the service center. With that being said, in a decade from how when other EV manufacturers close the performance and charging network gap, those aforementioned shortcomings will heavily impact my consideration of alternative EVs.",

Tesla Model S, Model 3, and Chevrolet Volt owners are the \"happiest\" EV owners. Another major finding: EV ownership and use and road-trip charging infrastructure are really much better than other drivers think. Tesla owners, especially, feel the least constraint and hassle when taking long distance road trips.

      "title": "Tesla P3D+ owner since October 2019. I've got a few observations and want to know if others sense the same?",
      "text": "Hello Everyone, I will attempt to keep this brief (who am I kidding? :) ) BUT to the point.\n\n  \nPicked up a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance with FSD/Autopilot, October 7th 2019. It was amazingly fast, coming from a 2011 BMW M3 Manual, the P3D is an amazing performer. I still love my M3 and will probably now modify it even more to compete with the P3D.. but I digress.. I have observed (some not verifiable yet; but working on getting the tools to perform the tests) the following issues with the vehicle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) During Supercharging do you hear random \"Clunks\" or \"Thumps\" randomly? In the span of 45 minutes, I will hear 5 to 6 random thumps that emanate from the body. I also noticed getting the same thumps, when driving down a mountain road, and can sustain a recharge while going downhill for a few minutes. \n\nI akin the sound to the individual battery cells bursting.. :)\n\n2) The car performed flawlessly with Software version 2019.36.x.. the power increase was observable. Then I updated to 2019.40.x., and the car seems to have lost its raw power.. Acceleration isn't as exhilarating as it was before. Initially I thought that I got used to the car ( I will be verifying the 0-60 times with hardware timers once they arrive caused by the Christmas shipping lag.) \n\nMy suspicions of nerfed acceleration got additional \"fuel\" after driving 80 miles at 72 degree weather to my destination. The car wasn't feeling as strong, battery was at 90 miles remaining. \n\nI happened to come to a stop light and decided to see if I'm just hallucinating. Road conditions were clean, dry, straight, no dips, and no loose gravel or anything that could potentially trigger traction control. Tires have 3000 miles on them. \n\nLight turns green, I slam on the accelerator pedal, I get a quick lurch forward (0-6 mph), then power loss for 1 second ( I literally thought the car died), then it accelerates, but not as it should. I haven't been able to reproduce that issue again; I've tried accelerating on wet roads to see whether I can reproduce that power loss; nothing yet. \n\nSince then I have been even more skeptical if the car is performing as it should be (will be making an appointment with the Manufacturer to go over my concerns)\n\nNOTE: Yesterday I received the 2019.40.50 update (FSD Visualization) \n\n3) I do quite a bit of driving with the car; on the weekends, I will typically drive from San Diego to LA (about 110 miles) and consume approximately 130 to 140 battery miles. I figure with the lights, radio, A/C, heater that there will be parasitic losses. I also drive a \"bit\" over the speed limit so I am quite aware that I won't be getting the ranges advertised by the EPA and Tesla. However, today coming back from LA to San Diego caused me great concern. \n\nI was up at Angeles Crest in the morning, weather was in the 30s. When we were about to leave, the car reported that my tire pressures have dropped down to 36 to 37 psi on all four. Those numbers aren't low based on previous experiences, so I drove down the mountain with no  issues. A total of 40 battery miles was used for a 33 mile trip. The car rested a few hours in 60 degree weather. I head to a supercharger and charge the vehicle to 224 miles. It was late and I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for the remaining miles.\n\nUpon leaving the supercharger, weather conditions were 50 degrees and raining. I drive the 110 miles back to home, mostly \"downhill\" from LA to San Diego county. Tires at 37 to 38 psi, and the **car battery went from 224 miles to 22** miles when I finally reached my destination. I drove a conservative speed of 70  mph on average the entire trip.  \n\n200 battery miles to go 110 miles, 37 psi tires, 50 degree weather, raining, average speed of 70 mph.. \n\nDid the tire pressure make that much of a difference? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're able to relate to any of these issues with the Model 3, please let me know. In the meantime I plan to make an appointment and address these issues with the Tesla technician. I just wanted to know if my observations have any validity. \n\nIf I have posted against the rules, my sincere apologies, and I will remove.\n\nHappy Holidays to Everyone, may you have a safe and happy holiday!",

      "title": "Purchased Performance Model 3 with a discount",
      "text": "**TL;DR** \n\n1. I bought a P3D with a $4,600 discount. Though it had done 1,800 miles, it was sold to me as a new car and has the same warranty as any other Model 3. I'm elated. \n2. Be diligent about discounts. 2018 Model 3 cars are being discounted for odd reasons, but the discount tends to NOT show up on the MVPA. Call and have people submit tickets to have the price corrected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Long Story Long**\n\nI ordered a Long Range Dual Motor Model 3 on 20190304 (that's the only logical date format, heathens--units ordered largest to smallest.) Did not order with FSD. Total was $53,000. \n\nCool.\n\nAs the title suggests, this changed quite a lot by the time I took delivery.\n\nAfter 2 days, I was matched with a VIN. Great. Let's call this car Match 1. I get the MVPA (purchase agreement) for Match 1 and it all looks good, except it showed the condition as \"New - Previous service/demo vehicle\"\n\nWtf? \n\nSo I asked my Inside Delivery Advisor about it. Now, this bloke wasn't the most helpful--he had terrible response times and he didn't answer my questions at all, but I have to cut him some slack; I hear the Inside Delivery Advisors are dealing with 100-150 orders at any given time...\n\nWhen he finally replied to my email, he gave me an explanation that I now know to be untrue. Whatever. I asked if there was a discount--he said no. I also found that this was untrue...but only after getting matched with a different car. There should have been a discount, but it wasn't reflected on the MVPA and he didn't go looking in the right system.\n\nWhy would I accept a 2018 with that odd condition when I could just wait a bit more and get a 2019? I had him unmatch me from Match 1 so I could wait for a 2019 vehicle.\n\nWhile waiting, I decided that I would be fine with Match 1 if I could just get a discount. Tesla Sales in Fremont (I think) recommended I talk to the Manager at my local (Dallas--Cedar Springs) Delivery Center. I called and asked, but never even spoke to the Manager, who had one of his Sales guys call me back and try to match me with a different vehicle (Match 2) that showed a $500 discount. This vehicle had less that 100 miles on it, so I'm not sure why it was discounted. Perhaps the manufacture year? Who knows...\n\nOkay, fine, match me. \n\nThe MVPA hits my inbox. No discount. Wtf? I ask my IDA about it and he says he's never seen a discount like this (really?), so he's surprised, but he does see it when he looks in the right system, so he'll submit a ticket to get the discount reflected in the MVPA.\n\nK.\n\nWhile considering my situation and how weird and disjointed the process was proving to be, I remembered the Performance Model 3 I had driven several weeks earlier. Instead of dealing with these cars that had questionable histories anyway (couldn't nail down their exact history) and waiting for them to be shipped to Texas, what if I could buy a local car? What if I could buy the P3D I had test driven?\n\nNow, hear me out. This isn't the craziest idea. Sure, people thrash Teslas when they test drive them, but the P3D is supposed to have binned motors which perform better and can handle extra output, etc. Also consider that the Model 3 has a better power platform (larger cabling, better inverters, better battery cells {2170 vs 18650}) to begin with...besides, the car is still sold as new; I'd be the first owner. And it comes with the same warranty as any other Model 3. If I could get a good discount on it, maybe I could justify springing for the Performance, which I had elevated to dream car status since the test drive.\n\nSo I called the Delivery Center and asked them about it. It turned out that the car I drove had about 2,000 miles on it. Not bad, but the Sales Advisor told me that the Northpark Gallery (also in Dallas) had an identical car which had fewer miles. Considering that the Gallery does waaaaaay more test drives than the Delivery Center (according to them), I would be better off buying the Northpark twin version of the car I had test driven because it's fundamentally newer (less total miles in a shorter timespan). I'm not sure if that's the case, but it seemed like my best shot, so I went to see it.\n\nIt was perfect. Seriously, not a scratch, dent, or uneven panel gap. Best part? $4,600 discount. I couldn't justify Performance at $11,000--just didn't seem like it was worth the money. But what about $6,400? That seemed fairly reasonable to me. And I wouldn't have to wait for the car to be shipped! I ended up add FSD, too--partly because of resale value, partly because of pride, and partly because I'm spending this much money, I sure as hell better have every feature available.\n\nSo I went for it. MVPA comes back...needing an adjustment. Twice. First MVPA reflected the discount from Match 2 (\\~$500). IDA submitted a correction request. This MVPA came back with a $2,600 discount. No idea where that number came from. I called local Tesla gallery and had them submit the ANOTHER adjustment request since they originally quoted me the $4,600 discount. \n\nFinally got the correct amounts on the MVPA. Perfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis car is absolutely insane. It's the future and I'm damn proud to be part of it. FSD will happen...or it won't. That's the gamble we make. Still, for $80/month, I can show off the summon feature and get whatever fun gimmicks come out of Elon's eccentric mind/team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n1. I can't endorse this method enough. If you like the car you test drive and it doesn't have any apparent flaws, just buy that one. Don't wait for a match, don't wait for shipping...just buy a car from a local gallery. From VIN match to delivery, it was 4 days. If I had known from the beginning I could buy that car at that discount, I could have gone through the whole process in literally 4 days, as I already had financing.\n2. Apparently Tesla has a lot of Model 3 (2018 manufactured) sitting around waiting for a buyer and they're selling them under the condition I cited above. Tesla is also having an issue with their systems reflecting discounts properly. If you get matched with a vehicle bearing the same condition I cited above, MAKE SURE you're getting your discount. If there is no discount, ask someone else. Call your local gallery, call a delivery center, call the main Tesla Sales number...if they all say there's no discount, I guess it's true. Just don't trust what Advisor 1 says--get a 2nd (and possibly 3rd) opinion.",

But I have it on max regen and it\u0019s all local miles. But as you can see, driving about 40 miles is using up about 200 miles of range. So I\u0019m getting about 50 miles from an 80% charge! That seems bad even if I have been a bit heavy footed.\n\nNow here\u0019s the extra info that might be significant. This was an ex showroom vehicle. So it was sat in the Tesla centre presumably on permanent charge for months, with people getting in and out of it (no actual driving). \n\nHas this had an effect on the battery, or is 50 miles really all I can expect unless I start driving sensibly?",

I have had a company owned Ford Escape for the past 6 years but the new position does not offer a company car.\n\nMy decision is coming down to the Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus or the new Toyota RAV4 XSE Hybrid.  The cost of the vehicles is a wash, although the RAV4 would cost another $100 or so a month for gas at current prices.  I expect to be driving 18,000 miles a year if I take this new position, the vast majority of which will be highway miles.  \n\nI really want to go with the Tesla, I already have Tesla solar panels on my house and I highly value the green nature of electric driving, not to mention Autopilot for all those highway miles I would be driving.\n\nThe thing that scares me is the amount of room in the vehicle.  I would prefer the Model Y, but seeing as that won't be available for another couple years the Model 3 is my only Tesla option.  There is a local Tesla store and I did take one for a test ride, however I couldn't put any car seats or strollers or anything else our family hauls around with us.

      "text": "The last two days I've had a loaner car while Tesla fixes a few minor build issues on my new 2023 Model 3 RWD and I've gotten to do a back to back comparison of it with the 2018 Model 3 LR RWD and find the differences really interesting. I'll highlight a few very noticeable ones.\n\n1. Build quality has definitely improved significantly and the new interior I prefer in every aspect over the older one.\n2. Acceleration on the 2018 is noticeably faster, especially over 60 mph and below 30. I do wish Tesla kept the \"performance\" motor for the LFP models like that had for a few weeks at the end of 2021 with slightly less range than the efficiency motor. I rarely find myself thinking the 10-15 miles of extra range is worth it vs. the acceleration boost of the older RWD motor. I believe it was 0-60 in 5 seconds and I think this is perfect. It's enough to be very fun but not so much that it's obnoxious like the performance models. I was surprised so to just how much quicker it is vs. the current RWD.\n3. Ride quality is significantly better on the 2023. The suspension is clearly updated. On the highway in FL it's not very noticeable, but as I hit some regular roads, the difference is stark. The 2018 suspension is very jarring.\n4. The Premium sound is significantly better than the partial premium missing the sub-woofer. I didn't think it would be as noticeable of a difference, but put on any EDM, Pop, Techno, or Rap music and it's instantly noticeable the difference.\n5. The AMD chip is noticeably faster and smoother than the Intel chip.\n6. I'm glad Tesla switched to the blacked out features, I don't think the chrome on the door handles and window trim looks very good.\n7. Efficiency is significantly better on the 2023 RWD.\n8. The USS is surprisingly not as important as I thought. My car doesn't have them and I find the \"STOP\" warning with USS is not calibrated well enough for it to be useful. It tells me to \"STOP\" with about 5 inches left so I still have plenty more room to move the car into my garage or around another vehicle. As someone who had never had USS on a vehicle before, I find my mirrors are far more accurate for getting around obstacles than the sensors are. While they are a nice to have, they are not as necessary as I had initially thought before using them.\n\nI hope Tesla comes out with a LR RWD model again as I think it will be the preferred option for most people, especially if they price it Sub-$50k. I suspect this may happen to meet the Tax credit since the LFP battery may not qualify. A LR RWD option with the performance motor and 350-400 miles of range would be incredible.",

I\u0018ve been considering the long range, and it doesn\u0018t seem to make sense in Europe? \n\nSee, you get the LFP battery with the SR, meaning you can use 100% without issue. The LR has 30% more battery capacity, but you wouldn\u0018t want to use all of it, so in daily driving they are about the same, practically speaking right?\n\nThen you might say it\u0018s useful for roadtrips, but is it really? It\u0018s going to save you like what, 10 minutes on your first charge? Not something I\u0018d pay for, seeing how rarely that\u0018d come into play.\n\nOn top of that, the long range has disadvantages in weight, making it use more energy, tires, and making handling worse. It\u0018s not a ton more weight admittedly, but still.\n\nSo I guess that leaves the power advantage, and better speakers. Those are for sure great to have, but are they worth 8k?

Some examples:\n   * Siri/Assistant\n   * Home screen widgets\n   * More graphs\n   * Notification center\n   * Apple watch &amp; Wear support\n   * Auto-backup data\n   * Custom alert notifications\n\nI've decided to start the app out in free beta for little a while to get as much feedback as possible to make sure things get to a good state for this initial set of features.\n\nAt full launch I would charge a small fee for the app - I'll be continuing to iterate and add features to the app over time, and want this to eventually include every feature you'd like in a mobile app for your Tesla. This isn't just a one-time release, so if there's enough interest, charging a small fee would to allow me to work on the app part/full time depending on the amount of interest (I'm a software engineer at a search engine company you may have heard of, and they have some flex-time options =L).\n\nI also created r/bestla for updates and announcements from me as well as general talk about the app. If you have a feature request, please [let me know](https://bestla.kampsite.co/)! Just make sure it doesn't already exist there, and be sure to upvote the features you want to see next. I'm thinking voice assistant support is the next move, especially to give iOS users some more outside-of-app options, but I'll wait for the community to decide what is most wanted next =\u0001",

      "title": "My personal observations, experience and thoughts during and after the pick up",
      "text": "**A little bit of background**Model 3 is my first EV, I was a little nervous but majority of my feeling was excitement. I drove a 370z prior to Model 3, and I love the Z, it has a great handling, decent 0-60, all around a fun vehicle to drive.\n\n**A unique car buying experience**I have bought 2 cars before, and Tesla offers a unique buying experience, it's not a revolution in my view but what they awesomely do is that they simplify the process by a lot. Honestly it took my by surprise when they said, \"Ok, great, you're all set and congratulations\" after just 40 something minutes. I got in and out so fast, I felt like I was buying something not as major as car - which is great, there's nothing bad about it, I'm just taken a back a little by how easy it was. So easy I forgot to ask for a copy of a sales contract for my record.\n\n**Interesting first time experience**Our Model 3 only had 168 miles when we checked out. We went to Santana Row to have a dinner and to charge our car. I learned some important lessons as a first time user (as well as my observations)\n\n* I was a bit unlucky, our first charging station gave us a lot of headache. Not only it did not charge but also I could not release / pull / unlock the charging cable even after I unlocked it via my phone and the control center. Fortunately not too far out there was a Tesla showroom, they managed to unlock after a while but unfortunately they could not figure out how and why. Well, fortunately my wife was able to find out. So for those out there with a faulty charging cable (this is Blink EV charging station) and could not unlock, make sure you detach it from your Tesla connector/adapter first before unlocking it via your mobile app / control center. This did the trick for us.\n* I will make sure I have all the apps I need to charge the car before I go somewhere. In my case yesterday I did not have Blink and the signal was just awful.\n* EV and in this case Model 3 are oh so quiet (obviously coming from a sport car like Z)\n* For us personally, we were overwhelmed by the technology (Model 3 is very unconventional for sure) and I think generally it's a good idea to just go home, get to know your car intimately, rather than -let's say- go to a very crowded mall on a Saturday night.\n* I have to get used to how the car brakes when I release the accelerator. I like it, I just need to get used to it.\n* The screen is just wow. I love how perfect the size is. I wasn't sure before that the screen may be too big. Definitely it looks bigger in photos, but it's the perfect size.\n* Many reviewers said that the UI is difficult. I find it not completely true. Yes, there is a learning curve but overall it's intuitive. They also said that it makes it difficult to do certain things while driving: ie opening a glove box, I may be a minority here but who keeps opening a glovebox while driving? Even if I have to do that it's easier now because it is within reach to open the glove box now.\n* Many reviewers complain about having no dashboard, this made me nervous. But I love it. Not so much about the simplicity, but for me being able to have a bigger real estate to view the road is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.\n* This may take a while but I'm training myself to **move away from the Mobile phone battery mentality**. Because every time I see my battery hit 60-70%, I become panic - will this last for the today; I have to quickly find a charging station; what if my battery dies.. that sort of thing. There was moments yesterday where I kept checking how much the battery left versus how much mileage do I get. I definitely have to change the way I think.\n\nThis car is fantastic. My wife was not into cars at all, but once she was in the car, she was completely overwhelmed with so much greatness about the car.\n\nLove it!",

      "title": "Six month review - best purchase ever?!",
      "text": "Hey Everyone! I wanted to share my experience owning my 2021 Model 3 SR+ so far. This sub has gave me so much information over the last few months, so I'd like to contribute. I'll try to touch on the most important parts. Coming from a 2012 Kia Optima that I loved, I actually thought I'd miss it... how absurd?!\n\n# Pros\n\n* **No Traditional car dealership** \\- Just custom ordered online and picked up 3 months later. In and out of the dealership in 20 minutes.\n* **Absolute joy to drive** \\- The ride is quiet and smooth, the acceleration is unlike anything else and the steering is super responsive. It's so much fun to drive! I'm still constantly looking for reasons to drive and I still giggle every time I punch the accelerator. Driving my wife's Honda Civic now feels like some sort of punishment. \n* **Software Updates** \\- My car has gotten BETTER since I first purchased her 6 months ago. With each update I've gotten new or enhanced features like mirror auto-dimming control, Disney +, carwash mode and bug fixes. The app has also been packed with features like live sentry-cam viewing and I can now talk through my car with a monster voice! That made halloween more interesting for sure! Very cool to see Tesla is actively pushing upgrades and staying on top of software. \n* **Charging at home** \\- I always wake up to a \"full tank\", no more going to the gas station! I use the regular 110v mobile charger that came with car and plug it in every time I get home. According to opti-watt, I consume about **$10 worth of electricity every month.** \n* **Roadtrips/SuperCharging** \\- SuperChargers are basically everywhere and the trip planner works great. Absolutely no range anxiety at all. SuperCharging is cool, and gives you some time to grab a bite to eat or take a power nap. \n* **One pedal driving** \\- Because of Regen Braking, you really only use the accelerator to drive. I got used to it very quickly and now prefer it, it's contributes to making the car such a joy to drive. Regen Braking also makes driving downhill very efficient as it feeds energy back to your battery and increases range. It's an amazing feeling to be creating energy like that.\n* **The Tesla App** \\- The app is awesome and allows me to basically control the entire car. I can set/schedule Climate control, making the cabin nice and cozy. I can schedule charging, toggle sentry mode, view live cameras and acts as keyless entry/start so I don't have to carry keys. I can also share directions with the car so navigation is q'd up and ready when I get in. The app makes everything very convenient.\n* **Miscellaneous cool features** \\- Things like, Auto-Fold Mirrors per location, so now when I pull up to certain parking spots, my mirrors fold automatically. Voice commands work really well and come in very handy while driving. The fart/emissions prank is silly and everyone loves it. DogMode is great and very useful.\n* **No oil or scheduled maintenance** \\- No more oil changes every 3k miles! Driving one of the most American made cars on the road and no longer dependent on foreign oil.\n* **AutoPilot** \\- Basic AutoPilot is pretty impressive. It steers, brakes and accelerates for you. It makes morning drives more relaxing. I understand it's a work-in-progress, so I stay aware and keep my hands on the wheel, but it works well for the most part. \n* **Easy to clean** \\- The interior is minimal and really easy to wipe down. The seats are durable and basically stain resistant. I just use a damp warm soapy rag and everything cleans up so nicely.\n* **Mobile Service** \\- My driver side interior pillar wasn't properly clipped in, I just didn't notice at delivery. I scheduled mobile service using the app and a tech showed up 3 days later, fixed the pillar in 5 mins, we admired/chatted about the car and he left. It was perfect. \n\n# Cons\n\n* **Cruise Control Phantom Braking** \\- Using TACC (Traffic Aware Cruise Control) I've experienced a few very dangerous instances in which Cruise Control braked heavily while at highway speeds for no reason at all. This was extremely scary and could have resulted in a bad accident. It makes using Cruise Control nerve-wracking and make me apprehensive to relax on the highway or road trips. **If Tesla had a dumbed-down Cruise Control that only set your speed, nothing more... This car would be absolutely 100% PERFECT.**  \n\\*I fully understand Phantom Braking when using AutoPilot because AutoPilot is trying to drive for you and it's still a work-in-progress. **Cruise Control should work differently.** \n* **My wife wants to drive it all the time** \\- It only took her a few rides and now she wants to drive it everywhere! She's not usually impressed by much, but she is in love with this car.\n\n**TLDR:** This is the best car I have ever owned and possibly the best purchase I have ever made. No buyers remorse at all. Even after 6 months I still make up reasons to drive it and often find myself standing in the garage just looking at it haha.   \nMy only complaint is the need for a **dumbed-down** or **classic cruise control** to eliminate phantom breaking. If Tesla provided that in a future Software Update, it would easily make the car 100% perfect, in my opinion.",

      "text": "Use your car like a tool and don\u0019t stress about stupid things. It\u0019s not always your fault and your car can get totaled tomorrow so just enjoy it and don\u0019t pour money into keeping it like new.\n\n1. You can always call and ask to see if you can get delivery earlier or check in-stock vehicles near you after placing your order.\n\n2. Do a walk around of the vehicle in 4K when you get it to claim issues found later through service without stressing on delivery day.\n\n3. Even if you only get the SR RWD, the battery can be charged to 100% vs 80% on the others and the other minor things won\u0019t really be missed in daily driving. In fact, people who envy you won\u0019t even be able to tell the difference what version you got unless they\u0019re an enthusiast anyway.\n\n4. Windshield chips can be filled. Paint chips can be blended with a $30 kit. And curb rash will happen. Use a sharpie for the rims and you won\u0019t even care after a few days or notice. For major stuff windshields can be replaced. Panels can be repainted. You can literally buy new rims. Interior trim can be replaced. Stuff that\u0019s not your fault will either be covered by someone else\u0019s insurance or Tesla warranty. \n\n5. Always use dash-cam and sentry mode. Dash-cam only records the last hour on a loop so save a clip of you need to when something happens. This can be done manually through the UI.\n\n6. If you buy FSD beta, you\u0019ll have to wait after delivery until your version is behind the current FSD version. This can take weeks or months. So don\u0019t buy until it\u0019s ready for your car.\n\n\nToo many people freak out over stuff but the truth is when the car has like 60k or 100k miles you won\u0019t care as much as you do now and full replacements of stuff will be better done then anyway.",

      "title": "Thoughts, Musings &amp; Experience: Delivery Day &amp; Day 1",
      "text": "Picked up my Midnight Silver Metallic AWD Tesla Model 3 yesterday (2018-09-25) and wanted to share my experiences in the first 60miles.  Not a lot of time, and only 1 day of ownership, but everyone asks - so I figured I'd tell.\n\nI've been on the reservation list since April 2016, and have been counting every day I've been waiting.  As with almost every other post like this... all I can say is that it is worth the wait.  The car really is everything I wanted it to be.  If you are still in line, just hang tight.  \n\n\n(Quite a lot of information below, so hopefully it answers questions for you.  Feel free to ask questions.  Please give me a little latitude on the flow - I've been writing this in little chunks since last night.  If something isn't clear, let me know and I will update.)\n\n----\n**TL;DR** : TL;DR : Amazing vehicle. PPPPP<\u001f<\u001f (7 out of 5 Stars).   By **far** the most performant, enjoyable, and technologically advanced machine on wheels I've ever been in.  I fly helicopters for fun, and the Model 3 is gives those experiences a run for its money.  Certainly the most exciting vehicle with wheels I've ever been in!\n \n*Images:* [Side View](https://i.imgur.com/rwpqUHy.jpg) , [Interior View](https://i.imgur.com/1zq0MzV.jpg), [Nose View](https://i.imgur.com/FzOVReH.jpg)\n \n----\n\n**Positives / Cool Things**: \n\n* Delivery was fast and painless.  No paint issues to notice. No misaligned panels.  Car seems perfectly built.  Will update if something changes here.\n\n* AWD has incredible torque and pickup.  I've not been able to *open it up* fully yet - but the fact that I could get to 85 in about 100ft was amazing.  Not even a chirp from the wheels when I launched either.\n\n* The sleek interior is perfection.  Nothing to distract your view or your driving experience.\n\n* The display is very impressive.  Driving at night is quite easy by not having the bright dash board right in your visual center (as is with other vehicles).  Automatic dimming is impressive.  A little daunting for the first 30 minutes, but very easily understood and usable.\n\n* Phone Key is a great idea.  Walk up and it turns on. Walk away and it turns off and locks.  Very simple to use.   I was a 2 x Leaf owner (2013 and 2016) and I am used to turning it on and off. So, felt a little weird at first, but I'm sold.  It works.\n\n**Negatives / Odd Things**: \n\n* Automatic Windshield Wipers \u0013 definitely need tuning. Not impressed - and in truth, this is my only real gripe with the car.  The area had torrential rain yesterday, and I found myself moving from Automatic to full-speed wipers manual... often.  Way too often.  Also, towards the end of the storms, the system would not trigger until I was nearly unable to see out of the windshield.\n\n*  The charger door seems a little temperamental when it comes to automatically opening with the charger cable.  Touch always worked for me, but I'm at about 50% with the charger.\n\n* Door handles are awkward.  I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but \"push with your thumb and grab\" is an odd motion for a car.\n\n* Smudgy surfaces everywhere.  Center console display, glossy storage area doors.  I'm not sure I would have gone with glossy surfaces.  I'll probably do a wrap on the console.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n**Delivery:**\n\n* *Summary:  Very efficient and fast delivery out of the Devon, PA dealership.  They were very busy, 4 cars in the out-door, covered delivery bay when I pulled in.  Paperwork was ready, and signing took 5-7 minutes.  Demo, walk-through, initial setup was about 20 minutes.  Then I was in the car, and on my first drive home.*\n\n* Walked in, met an admin who was signing people in.  There were a few people waiting in a seating area, and I was offered coffee and a seat.  I declined (really didn\u0019t need any more caffeine, I was excited enough already), and he told me someone would be with me in 5-10.\n\n* 3-5 minutes later, my Sales Specialist showed up, took us to a table to get a few signatures, review paperwork.  Since 99% of it was already done online, it was mostly a formality.  Got my PA registration documents, and wrapped it up in &lt;10 minutes.  I was asked to wait a bit until my Delivery Specialist was ready.\n\n* We burned 5-10 looking at the Model X.  (My wife got the glimmer in her eyes& so maybe someday.)  Was met on the floor by our Delivery Specialist who walked us out to the covered out-door delivery bay, and proceeded with a quick demo, walk-through, and setup session.\n\n* Started with the key-card lock/unlock process, then right in to getting both of our phones registered with the car, and got my personal settings (seat, mirror and steering wheel) set in the car.  We both had the apps pre-downloaded so it was a fast run through.  Quick overview of the in-car storage, task lighting, and marveled at the clean look, with very little \u001cstuff\u001d \u0013 it is all in the built in display!\n\n* Next, a walk through of the navigation systems, soft-buttons (how to open glovebox, turn on audio, seat heaters, open trunk/frunk, etc).  Touched on most of the setting screens one after another.  To be honest, it was a little too fast for consumption or retention.  But, I\u0019m glad I saw it all with someone there.  Knowing my own style, it did not bother me, I knew I\u0019d be back that night \u0013 in the garage \u0013 to go through it all on my own pace.\n\n* Then a quick demo of the charging door, lights, cables, connectors and adapters.  Kind of surprised they do not have a SuperCharger at the dealership \u0013 I\u0019d call that  pretty big miss on Tesla\u0019s part.  Every dealership should have at least one.\n\n* We ended with the ceremonial photo, and then delivery was done.  About 25 minutes of Demo/walkthrough.  Whole thing took ~30 minutes from rolling in to the dealership to zipping out at Mach 3 in my Model 3.\n\n* *Note*, the Devon, PA Tesla dealership is not permitted to do PA Inspections, so you will have to do that at your local spot sometime in the next 10 days.  Not a big deal, and not Tesla\u0019s fault at all.  This is all due to PA\u0019s bizarre laws alone.\n\n\n**Interior:**\n\n* *Summary:  Interior, while it felt sparse at first glance, it really well designed and integrated with the display.  Clean lines and attention to detail is very clear in this car.  Materials are high quality.  Road noise is minimal.  Audio System is bangin'*\n\n* Visibility is very good.  Side view, rear view mirrors are well placed.  With a little adjustment they cover everything I need to see.  Not able to identify any real blind spots.  I love how the car auto-magically adjusts when a known user gets in.\n\n* Seats are very comfortable.  Firmness and fit is great for me.  Adjustment are sufficient and can give you a great fit.  I recommend taking the time to adjust things a few times to get it right.\n\n* I sit rather low in the car - and that makes entrance and exit less than elegant, so I may need to adjust a little.  Once seated visibility and comfort are fine.\n\n* I was a little shocked by the dash/display in the car.  When you first get in things are suspiciously empty and the display looks imposing.  Likely this is just because you are so used to every other car in existence.  And, in truth, this car is nothing like any car in existence - and as soon as you cross that threshold, there is no coming back.  Once you get comfortable with the interface and the buttons, it makes sense.  So, I guess what I'm saying here is ignore and trepidation you feel in the first few minutes in the car.  It is designed this way for a reason.  Trust in Elon. :)\n\n* I love the amount of *hidden* storage in the car.  Behind every door is a nice space to store things.  And, they all seem to go way far back too.  Same goes with the trunk - pull up the cover, more space!  I'm not a fan of the black gloss doors.  I feel like they will get smudged and scratched.  Only time will tell, but that's my assumption at this point.  I'm looking at the matte black wraps - and I feel like that will do what I really need.\n\n* Audio System sound is fantastic.  Really impressed with the speakers in the car.  Very high end sound, crystal clear, no oddities.\n\n* Back seats are quite comfortable.  Plenty of leg room.  Oddly enough, two people sitting in passenger-rear have had issues putting on the seatbelt and using the center-seat's connector.  They use the shoulder belt, and end up putting it in the wrong socket.  Have not had the issue myself.\n\n* Both front and rear \"open the door\" buttons seem awkward.  People always seem to assume they have something to do with the windows.  Likely just a training issue, but it isn't intuitive at this point.  \n\n* Glass Roof is beautiful.  I've not had a crazy sunny day yet, but light does not seem too much at all.  Tint is appropriate.  Sitting in the back seat gives you the best view of the openness and spacious feeling.  Great design element.\n\n\n**Exterior:**\n\n* Panels are all aligned perfectly.  No issues that I can see at all.\n\n* Paint / Colors / Finish seems perfect.  I really like the Midnight Silver Metallic - it has a great presence.\n\n* Door handles require some odd hand movements to open the car.  Push with your thumb, reach over and pull handle.  This may be something you just get used to, but it does not feel natural.  I appreciate the fact that they are flush with the door - but something isn't entirely fluid about the motions you need to open.\n\n* While I love the frunk/trunk - they should be automatic open on a car in this class.\n\n* Charging port is a great location, and is invisible when not in use - nice touch.  It does seem to be a little temperamental when it comes to opening with the charging handle.  I've only had about a 50% chance of it opening as I approach.  Perhaps I'm not doing it correctly yet.  Touch open/close works 100% of the time.\n\n\n**Driving:**\n\n* Handling - Amazing - like the car is driving on rails.  Tight steering makes the car feel very solid.  I've not gone into too many high speed turns yet, but from the few artificial hard turns, everything stays where it is supposed to.  Sway is minimal.\n\n* Acceleration - OMG - I'm used to the pickup and torque of an electric motor.  Been driving a Nissan Leaf for 6 years.  So, while I expected a difference, I didn't expect this.  I test drove an early RWD, and that was peppy.  This AWD is like a completely different animal altogether.  \n\n* Automatic Breaking / ReGen - This will take a bit getting used to.  Again, Leaf had something similar, but this is a 10x difference.  It goes very heavy on the brake when you let up on the accelerator fully.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, and re-calibrate my single-pedal feathering... but it was a shock.  Come to a light and let up... the car reacts quickly and slows you down.  I know there a other settings to minimize the braking, but I will leave it \"standard\" and see if I can learn the car.\n\n* Distance Sensing / Alerts seem to be a little too conservative for me.  It yells at me when pulling in the garage or backing out. I do understand that it senses distance, and it is surely accurate, but I ended up turning off the chime.  Visual indicator is fine.\n\n* Operation of the Console Display is actually quite easy while driving.  I had thought it would be difficult or distracting.  So far I've not really had issue with it yet.  Most of the settings - once perfected and on Auto - should be set-it-then-forget-it. \n\n* Approach Lock / Unlock is a great feature.  Have to get used to it a little, but I am certainly a fan of the feature.\n\n\nSo, that's it... let me know if you have any questions.\n",

      "title": "The Base Highland Sound System Is Perfectly Fine",
      "text": "I am happy to report back from a Tesla showroom that the Model 3 RWD base sound system is, in fact, best-in-class. \n\nI believe that it competes well with other sound systems in its segment, up to competing sedans/hatchbacks, and on first impression outdoes competitors like the BMW Hi-Fi and Audi base sound systems. \n\nFurthermore, it is on par with if not notably superior to premium audio options offered in the compact EV segment. It outshines the Harman Kardon system I had and loved in an i3, and also the Hyundai IONIQ. I used the joke that it ate the previous-generation Harman Kardon systems for lunch like Billie Eilish. Billie Eilish\u0019s music, which is now used as reference for tuning by audio brands due to the range and popularity of songs like \u001cBad Guy,\u001d shines on the system. \n\nThis isn\u0019t surprising since nine speakers isn\u0019t too far off of a typical 10-12 luxury base/premium audio system, and many modern systems rely on woofers in the door panels rather than a subwoofer to produce bass. Tesla Model 3 RWD has a confident, punchy bass response that extends down into some sub-frequencies without too dramatic of a roll off. Reports that Tesla highlights the midrange frequencies, which brings out clarity and definition in vocals and instruments, are accurate and make the system audiophile-tuned even at the lower bitrate of a service like Deezer. I can\u0019t wait to one day hear Hi-Fi streaming services on the Model 3. \n\nI may admittedly be incorrect on this next observation as I had only test drove both briefly, but I preferred it to a 2018 Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive where I couldn\u0019t get the impact and clarity I was looking for at higher volumes especially with the windows down\u0014Model 3 RWD had no issue with distortion up to its max volume of over 102dB. \n\nNow, the 17-speaker sound system on the 2024 Model 3 Long Rage All-Wheel Drive and Performance is as mind-blowing as the setup would imply: it is absolutely the highest quality of clean, tight, impactful bass I\u0019ve heard from a stock sound system with plenty of clarity and separation across the range. The dual woofers in the doors paired with the dual subwoofers gives the system even more of a \u001cwow\u001d effect that, paired with the rest of the mid-range speakers and tweeters, may outdo nearly every sound system in its class. \n\nI believe that Tesla is targeting a more bass-heavy response than before that places emphasis on the mid-range without making the treble shrill, which quite honestly matches my preference for audio. There was no lack of bass on the RWD, as I could feel my shorts vibrating with both systems; although, more so on the AWD since it has the subwoofers as well as an impressive two additional woofers. Even playing with the EQ makes for changes that seem deliberate rather than random. Tesla did an excellent job with both systems. \n\nThe base Model 3 \u0018Highland\u0019 sound system is perfectly fine, probably phenomenal even and outdoes most base systems from competitors if not many premium audio systems found on other vehicles and especially electric vehicles. Model 3 RWD would almost be too good of a value relative to the market if it had come with such an amazing 17-speaker system. A single subwoofer as Tesla had noted in its initial press release would have made the RWD system perfect; however, it\u0019s not necessarily missed due to the competent performance of the woofers that are there and the difference would be less dramatic between both systems.\n\nModel 3\u0019s premium audio system offered on All-Wheel-Drive/Performance models simply takes the audio experience to another level. It\u0019s like the difference between a Model S Long Range and a Model S Plaid: both will get you there in style and comfort, but only one is insane. To be fair, both systems can be considered premium whereas the complete 17-speaker system is Ludicrous. \n\nOne more note: extra speakers in the back can make the rear display experience better for rear passengers, but isn\u0019t really necessary since there are speakers already and Bluetooth headphones can be paired. \n\nTLDR: Model 3\u0019s RWD system deserves the recognitions of excellence it\u0019s received. Model 3 AWD/Performance takes the sound to Ludicrous levels. Customers should be happy with either option, and there isn\u0019t a need to upgrade due to any lack of quality or fullness in the base RWD system. Nonetheless, the premium for the AWD can be worth it to have one of the best sound systems on the market. ",

Brought to service center as the car wont install updates, 2500 to replace a computer , tesla nor the third party carvana warranty cover that.. Its a 2019 with 38000 miles. Since i got the car its been a nightmare, last week it was the 12 v battery and now this.. Today i drove 45 mins each way and spent 2 hrs at the service center, and in the end refused the repair.. Tesla wont deal with third party warrrany even if it was a covered item . It was going to take 2 days to repair , NO LOANER , no uber ride to get home so I would have been stranded and forced to buy my own uber on top of the 2500 dollars ... My advice , dont buy a tesla from anyone except tesla because when s--- goes south , it goes real south.. Whats almost comical is that castlerock or whatever , the carvana warranty doesnt recognize tesla as an approved vendor ( because tesla refuses to deal with third party warranties) for repair , you cant make this  up",

I probably couldn\u0019t have driven some of the long days if I didn\u0019t have it. I used it about 95% of the trip.\n\nThe cost overall cost to make it from one coast to another. I could only imagine what it might have cost if I drove a gas powered vehicle\n\nThings I wasn\u0019t so fond of\n\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014-\nSuperchargers going from Poncha Springs, CO to Farmington, New Mexico were non existent. It really scared me a bit, because the range initially to make it to Farmington was 8% (312 + mile trip) and with outside temps being over 105 degrees after Colorado, I thought I wouldn\u0019t make it to the destination. I was able to have the AC between 4 and 7 most of that trip and somehow made it with 13% battery left. \n\nPhantom braking. I never experienced it since picking up the car in June and all of a sudden going into Iowa it stated to randomly occur while using cruise control and auto steering. I\u0019d say it happened after that point 50+ times on the trip.\n\nCharging times. The 30+ minutes of charging added about an extra 2+ hours every day to the trip. Making the 12 + hour drive from Denver to Phoenix turned into almost a 15 hour day. I should have been smarter and not powered through it like I did and split that leg of the trip into two days.\n\nBugs and the windshield wipers. It seemed as though bug guts were resilient to the wiper blades and the wiper fluid. I spent a couple of times each day going to a gas station and using the squeegee to clean off bug guts.\n\n\n\nWords of advice to others planning a long road trip or even for daily driving: please, please, please if you already haven\u0019t, buy yourself a sun shade for both the glass roofs front and back passenger sides of your car. It saved me from dying from the heat so many times on the trip. \n\nGood luck to others planning their near future road trips!",

      "title": "The One Month Review: Philly Suburbs Edition",
      "text": "So after the first month of owning my Model 3 (SR) in southeastern Pennsylvania, I've already learned quite a few useful tidbits of information about the car itself and its various post-delivery needs. Since some of these things include issues without immediate answers, If figured I'd share my experience for others living in our Tesla-heavy area who haven't yet taken delivery or for those who find other people writing about familiar surroundings enjoyable.\n\n**Pre-Delivery**: So between my initial order and my delivery, I moved from the D.C.-area back to PA. Of course, this was a very stupid move planning-wise for me, as it made the entire delivery process much more complicated than it needed to be. ***DO NOT*** do this if your estimated delivery is in the same general timeframe as your move. I was told, rather explicitly, by my Sales Rep (SA) that I couldn't take delivery of a vehicle with a PA license in Virginia, despite being told the opposite by a salesperson at the Tesla store I purchased from. Thankfully, I had ordered in the store with said SA, and so changing delivery sites was relatively straightforward. Additionally, I needed to update information such as my new Drivers License and Insurance, which I chose to do instead at the Devon location shortly after getting those things. If you're doing this same boneheaded process, I'd recommend just going to a Tesla store to do it instead of talking over the phone.\n\nOther assorted pre-delivery tidbits:\n\n* Carvana gave me an absolute fortune for my previous vehicle. Granted, it was in excellent condition and had low mileage, but thanks to the used car market, I got about 50% more than Kelly Blue Book had quoted me on. Very smooth process selling the car, and I chose to do so before moving to avoid PA's [very dumb vehicle registration process for new residents](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/New-Resident-Relocation-Information/New%20Residents/Pages/Motor-Vehicle-Information-for-New-Residents.aspx) and the associated fees.\n\n* If you do a test drive, I'd highly suggest a route between the Devon and KoP stores. Its a good mix of highway traffic along a short stretch of 202, as well as the type of residential and multi-lane roads you're probably used to driving during your normal routine. Even if you've already ordered a car, I'd strongly recommend doing it if you haven't already to get a feel for how it handles so your first experiences with regen braking aren't in a crowded parking lot with lots of other cars.\n\n**Delivery Day**: While there was some slight panel misalignment and and a few other small cosmetic issues, the delivery was an extremely smooth process. Minus my detailed inspection of the car and personalizing the interface, the total time spent doing paperwork and waiting was approximately 15 minutes. One important thing to note about the Devon location is that it had virtually no parking available. I was thankfully able to get a spot, but I'm pretty sure it was the last one available. Also important to know is that there is only parking on the east side of the service center, the other side appears to be strictly for inventory and was packed to the brim with wrapped up cars awaiting future delivery.\n\n**Post-Delivery**: For PA, there are some interesting things in the immediate post-delivery timeframe that are good to know ahead of time. These include:\n\n* Tesla's PA Service Centers aren't certified for State Inspections. While you'll be provided with a permanent license plate and temp registration on-site, you will need to get the car state inspected within the first two weeks. Schedule this ahead of time. Even more frustrating is that the Model 3, like other Teslas, has special jacking requirements due to the battery underneath. Many traditional auto-repair centers can't/won't service the car because of this, and you should be very cautious about where you take it to ensure your car isn't poorly handled like [/u/bbtow69's poor car was](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/npudzg/is_this_lifted_incorrectly/). Check out this [old Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bxgage/state_inspection_near_devon_pa_service_center/) for some helpful recommendations. The good news (I guess) is that [PA doesn't require an emissions test of electric vehicles](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvspubsforms/BMV/BMV%20Safety%20Inspection%20Bulletins/Safety_Bulletin_BI14-1.pdf).\n\n* If you have the (dis)pleasure of living under PECO's incompetence, they offer you [a whole $50 rebate](https://pecorebateportal.com/electric-vehicles/smart-driver-rebate.html) for your trouble. I'd say go spend it on Phillies tickets, but you should definitely spend it on a [paint repair kit](https://shop.tesla.com/product/paint-repair-kit) instead to cover for [PennDot's mismanagement](https://i.redd.it/576otwicf1t21.jpg) of our roads. More on the *pain* repair kit later.\n\n* Another important note regarding PECO are its peak/off-peak hours. For 2021, the [Super Off-peak hours are Midnight to 6AM, and Peak hours are from 2PM-6PM on weekdays](https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-peco-default-service-tou-rates-time-of-use-20201204.html). A standard rate applies during all other times. **EDIT** This rate does not yet apply, but a plan was proposed and approved in December 2020.\n\n* The Commonwealth itself offers a more substantial BEV incentive of [$750 for new or used vehicles under $50k](https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/grantsloansrebates/alternative-fuels-incentive-grant/pages/alternative-fuel-vehicles.aspx). This is a grant and is not tied to tax returns. However, it's first come, first serve, so get it while you can!\n\n* I had some slight panel misalignment and the plastic trim attached to my passenger-side mirror coming off, noted to the sales rep on delivery day. I didn't realize it, but you also need to separately file a service ticket through the app for this. They ultimately sent out a mobile service tech to fix both, and it was covered under warranty. It took a few weeks to get them out there, so I'd recommend filing the  service ticket on delivery day as soon as you get home.\n\n**The Driving Experience**: So this is (obviously) the best part of owning the car. Here's what I've learned while driving around the area:\n\n* Driving the car with full regen braking is incredibly fun along the winding curves of our area. It feels like a sports car, both in the comfort of the ride and the handling. One pedal driving is especially useful for close curves and hills, and it feels like you have far more control over the vehicle. Because our roads are [a bit special](https://i.redd.it/ypl9rt8y7h571.jpg), you'll likely notice the ride is a bit more bumpy due to the steel spring suspension of the Model 3. While this may be a deal-breaker for those used to a super smooth ride in a luxury vehicle, I've found it to be fine and gives the ride a bit more \"texture\" without the vibration of an ICE engine in front of you. It's simply more noticeable due to the bumpiness of the roads around here, and the potholes can be a bit unnerving. Overall, the car handled these like a champ, and I feel much more in control of my car when driving than I ever did its AWD predecessor. I've heard that potholes can be pretty dangerous for the 19\" and 20\" wheels, so definitely try to avoid those if possible.\n\n* I'd also recommend setting the car to creep or roll for the first hundred miles or so if you aren't used to driving with strong regen braking, as the transition is a bit difficult. Also good to know is that regen braking applies the tail lights at a certain braking threshold, so don't be paranoid like I was and assume you need to apply the brakes as well to avoid getting rear-ended. After you're used to the creep or roll, the transition to \"hold\" will be very smooth and is highly recommended to extend your range.\n\n* Autopilot will work on virtually any road with a median lane marker. Despite actively following Tesla development for nearly a decade, I was under the impression that AP functionality was geofenced to major interstates. Not true. It works on many roads, including rural \"highways\" such as Route 1, but keep in mind that it **will not** stop for stop lights and stop signs like FSD is supposed to. For Route 1 in particular, I wasn't quite ready to let the car handle the high-speed, blind curves around the MD border, so I switched over to manual and had some fun doing the legal speed limit of *55MPH* and still feeling like I'm going too fast. Speaking of country roads, my first major autopilot \"freak out\" occurred when passing an Amish Buggy. While driving on AP, the car saw the Buggy on the right and an oncoming car on the left, and as I drew closer, promptly threw a temper tantrum and kicked me out of AP. Thankfully, I was assuming that the Buggy might cause issues and was already in the process of switching over to manual control. On a later drive through this route without a buggy or oncoming traffic, I discovered that this particular area of road is a hotspot for Phantom Braking, so ultimately it was double-whammy of events. Overall, proceed with the regular amount of caution as you normally would for a buggy.\n\n* I had the joy to discover in late-May that [Tesla had made some important changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31HaTbWONmQ) to my vehicles components after ordering, and would be taking delivery of Tesla-vision vehicle without lumbar support. Outside of my test drive Model 3, I've not had any experiences with a radar-equipped M3, but what I can say is that I've felt quite confident in its ability function in clear conditions. I was also pretty happy to see that the car was receiving updates last week, and appreciated some of the other QOL changes such as the ability to toggle off the auto-brights during autosteer. I'd still prefer being able to outright disable the auto-brights given how bad they are at detection on highways, but for now I think I can deal with the current setup. The lumbar support omission hasn't been much of an issue to my passengers, however I'm still pretty annoyed about the situation.\n\n**Accessories and Other Tidbits**:\n\n* Since we live in a region with, ahem, *Four Seasons*, you'll definitely want to purchase [Splash Guards/Mud Flaps](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-mud-flaps) for your car to [protect the notably poor quality paint](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/55412/tesla-model-3-s-paint-problem-has-a-solution-now/) from salt and gravel spray. It's also recommended to purchase the PPF, but I forgot to add it to my cart that day and can't give a review for it. What I can give a review for are the splash guards and optional mud flaps. The flaps themselves are detachable and hang only about an inch and a half from the ground. I strongly recommend that you don't attach these, as they scrapped along the ground during turns. I have absolutely no idea how Tesla thought these were acceptable to sell to consumers at their current length, but I guess that's what I get for buying a car designed in always sunny, always summer California. The installation process was pretty easy, the only tools needed are a ratchet wrench fitted with a 10MM Hex attachment and a screwdriver to remove the pins on the wheel wells. It took about 20 minutes total to install both, and I'd recommend installing them as soon as you can after deliver to protect from any debris you kick up while driving.\n\n* If you're getting the SR+, the car somehow doesn't come with floor mats despite being a $40K vehicle. Given how many aftermarket floor mats are available, there are a lot of options to choose from. I can't really give a review for the ones I purchased, as I've only had them a month, but I can say you have a wide variety of options to choose from. You'll definitely want to buy something though to protect the car's interior carpet from mud, dirt and basically anything else.\n\n* I purchased a screen protector for my display from [Spigen](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-Designed/dp/B084BNC3FG/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2L662REOLO0LC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=spigen+tesla+model+3+screen+protector&amp;qid=1623845582&amp;sprefix=spigen+tesla%2Caps%2C147&amp;sr=8-2), and it's working pretty well so far. Installation was easy, and the matte anti-glare is largely unnoticeable but protects from smudging.\n\n* Having gotten many dings and scrapes on my previous car in public garages, I decided to purchase a paint repair kit in case it was needed. Frustratingly, in the very first week of ownership, I needed it. I'm not sure how it happened, but at some point my tire  kicked up a piece of debris with enough force that the edge of my rocker around the wheel well was bent-in to the extent that the paint split along a small section around the edge of the rocker where the side meets the wheel well. No matter the cause, the paint repair kit rather was relatively easy to use after watching a number of guides, with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FC0xCixhU0) being the best I could find. A good reason to install the guards as soon as you can, as it presumably would have prevented this damage.\n\n\n* I originally purchased [Silver RIMETRIX Orbitals](https://rimetrix.com/product/orbital-silver/) for my car because I wanted something a bit more flashy than the aero wheels. The plan was to buy them, then coat them with Duplicolor [Hyper Silver](https://www.duplicolor.com/product/hyper-silver-coating/) to give them a metallic finish that would reduce their plastics look. After owning the car for a few weeks, I actually found the Aeros to look just fine and cancelled my order. I may come back to the orbitals, but for now I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite dreaming of owning a Tesla for nearly a decade and following them very closely since the early Model S days, I started to get cold feet as delivery day approached and the Tesla vision announcement was made. I wound up taking delivery anyway, and I'm incredible happy that I did. The car handles exceptionally, is very intuitive to use, and most importantly, I just love looking at it and knowing its all mine. If you're in the same spot that I was, I hope this review gives you a bit more insight into a number of steps in this process, as well as some of the quirks and benefits of owning a Tesla in our area.

      "title": "1 Year and 16,000 Miles later with the Model 3 RWD - My Thoughts and experience.",
      "text": "I received my 2023 Model 3 RWD exactly 1 year ago today and will share my thoughts and experiences so far for anyone who is interested. In the last year I've driven 16,000 miles with an average wh/mi of 233 living in Florida.\n\nTo do the math out, that would equate to a range of approximately 249 miles if we assume 58kwh battery pack.\n\nCurrent range projected by the car at full charge is 264 miles, it changes sometimes though so I wouldn't fully trust this to predict true battery degradation.\n\nI am using aftermarket hub caps that look like the uberturbines, I'm assuming they slightly decrease overall efficiency.\n\nI also did the 4 speaker mod to activate the 2 door speakers and 2 A pillar speakers that were not activated, very glad I did this, really helps with imaging and staging compared to without them as the sound feels more full.\n\nI'll start with the things I really love about the car:\n\n* Dead reliable so far, I had a few adjustments at delivery, including a tire alignment and rear door alignment, since then, the only thing I have done is 2 tire rotations, wash the car, and fill the windshield washer fluid.\n* Phone Key - I absolutely love the phone key. I have a magsafe wallet on my phone that keeps one credit card and my drivers license, and I no longer have to carry anything else with me for 99% of my daily trips. No more keys, no more wallet, nothing but my phone with the small popsocket magsafe wallet on the back and I'm good to go.\n* Dog Mode - I have a 2 year old that loves to sleep in the car, being able to pull into the garage and let her continue sleeping with the AC on and being able to check on here remotely from the app with the internal camera is amazing.\n* Autopilot - I live exactly half way between Miami and Orlando and travel to both cities fairly often, Autopilot makes the 1.5-2  hour drive much easier. I've never had an unexplained phantom braking episode and come to trust it very well. I also played around with FSD quite a bit and find it works quite well in Florida as we have very well defined roads where I live and the FSD Highway driving has some nice improvements over base Autopilot for many applications.\n* \"Smart\" predictions for navigation - I love that if I have a calendar event with a location on it, when I get in my car near the time of the event, it automatically has it ready to go.\n* Sharing to the car - I love that I can pull an address on my phone or get it sent to me then simply share it to the car and it's ready to go.\n* UI/UX - I know a lot of people complain about the one big screen, after a year with it, I love it. I find it to be very intuitive with only a few minor nuances that are much less than previous \"button\" filled car's I've had.\n* White seats - They are super easy to clean, still look brand new, and really make the car look much more premium, in my opinion, than it would with the black seats.\n* One pedal driving - Once you get used to it, it's hard to go back.\n* Updates - It's always fun and exciting getting updates, even if it's minor things.\n* Efficiency - The cost to use the vehicle is so insanely low due to how efficient the Model 3 is, I never hesitate to drive or use the car however I want.\n* Traffic light chime - I love that when the light turns green, the car lets you know. All cars should have this!\n* Utility - Considering this is a mid sized sedan, the utilization of space is incredible. I recently had to bring my parents to the airport with 2 large suitcases, 3 carry ons and a back pack and was able to fit all of it plus 3 people (Myself and my parents). The Frunk fits a carry on perfectly and so does the sub-floor, that left the trunk for one large suitcase, backpack, and carryon and one of the back seats open for the second large suitcase. It's still no where near the Model Y level of utility, but very impressive for what it is.\n* Safety - I love knowing that I am driving one of the safest cars on the road if I were to get into an accident.\n* Looks - I still love how this car looks.\n* Fun - It's just a blast to drive this car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe things I don't like about the car:\n\n* Living in Florida, the seats make my back sweat horribly. I'm not a big guy (5'10\", 162lb) and my back is always sweating on the seats. I plan to swap the Model 3 with a Model Y as soon as the \"Juniper\" updates go live, just for the ventilated seats.\n* Seating position - For me, I don't love how low the seats are to the floor, It's not horrible, but on longer drives, I def wish the seats were a bit higher up.\n* Build quality - It's not horrible, but def not perfect. There's a few minor rattles and misalignments that most people wouldn't notice and don't bother me too much, but it's def not the best built car in the world.\n* Range - This is very situation dependent, but I live about 100 miles from Orlando and the same to Miami. The realistic range of this car doing highway driving is about 220 miles depending on a lot of factors. I can do a round trip to either city, but the second I stop to do anything else, I have to charge. The long range model would have been perfect allowing 280 miles of range, so more than enough to get there, do stuff all day, and get home. For most people, I suspect it will be fine.\n* Acceleration - Look, it's good, but once you drive the LR or performance models, it just feels lacking. I know I'll get hate for this, but I just want more lol.\n* Auto wipers - For me they have not been horrible and generally work, but they are also not great.\n* Paint Quality - The paint is def more delicate than other cars I've had in the past and the white looks dirty very quickly, especially with bugs splattered on the front.\n\nOther observations:\n\n* With the standard range models you AC Usage will have a pretty big impact on your range since you have a smaller battery pack compared to the LR models. In Florida, my watts/mile are much higher in the summer vs. the winter\n* I have all windows tinted except the front windshield, a lot of heat comes in through the front windshield. If I were to do it again, I would put a clear ceramic on the windshield as well to reduce heat transfer.\n* I have no issues with the tinted roof, it's more than enough to not transfer heat from my experience, the front windshield is where the majority of the heat comes in for me.\n\nOverall, Very happy with the car and I was considering getting a Model X as I need an SUV now (divorced with a child, so 1 car that needs to be able to do more than before). I have decided I prefer the Model Y over the X for a variety of reasons (Money isn't an issue, other factors are) and will upgrade as soon as the Juniper updates come out. I'm very impressed with the highland updates on the Model 3 and think they corrected the majority of the major issues of the car.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I'm sure I missed a lot, but if anyone is considering this car, I would highly recommend getting it once the Highland version is available to you (For us Americans)\n\n(Edited: Added a few more points I forgot about)",

It\u0019s a 15 speaker system with subwoofer. I previously owned a 2018 Model 3 and it was \u001cgood enough\u001d to where I never considered upgrading it. But the 2020 Model 3s replaced a large \u001cvent\u001d on the rear deck with a sealed metal rear deck and the bass response from the 6.5\u001d OEM subwoofer was sadly impacted from this change. This small change (along with pandemic boredom) were enough for me to decide I \u001cneed\u001d this. Also, mutually exclusive of the rear deck vent, the OEM subwoofer can\u0019t produce anything below 40Hz. It still sounds great but if you know your music well, there are many songs that are missing many sounds and you easily notice it.\n\n**How to install a subwoofer in a Model 3**\n\nFirst off... a huge thank you to Travis Llado who wrote an [incredibly thorough write up](https://www.travisllado.com/2019/05/tesla-model-3-stereo-part-9-summary-and.html) on the Tesla Model 3 audio and electrical system. I won\u0019t go too much into detail on installation details because his write-up is amazing and contains everything you need to know. But in summary, I tapped into the 12V power source underneath the rear seat bench and also tapped into the subwoofer speaker outputs from the OEM amplifier which provide the high-level inputs and remote turn-on signal for the JL subwoofer. I didn\u0019t install the solid-state relay or 100W/1© resistor as Travis and I think/hope the JL Audio\u0019s efficient Class D power load should be ok. If I encounter any issues I\u0019ll add those pieces.\n\n**Why the JL Audio Microsub?**\n\nI purchased the [JL Audio 12\u001d MicroSub+](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/acp112lg-tw1-car-audio-microsub-amplified-subwoofer-systems-93333) from Craigslist. I thought it was the smaller PowerWedge+ sealed box but it turned out to be the larger ported MicroSub+... but luckily that still fit perfectly into my car\u0019s lower \u001csub trunk\u001d (with slight alteration to the formed carpet as it\u0019s designed inefficiently with about 2\u001d of gap on all sides as the sub trunk pocket tapers inward as it goes down. The 10\u001d version of the MicroSub+ or the 12\u001d sealed PowerWedge+ would easily fit without modification. I don\u0019t have skills to build my own box and my buddy who normally builds custom fiberglass enclosures for me is currently too busy to help me at this time. I\u0019ve had JL Audio before in previous vehicles and know/trust the brand. Because of this, I didn\u0019t really look into any other brands for a subwoofer enclosure. In JL Audio I trust!\n\n**How much did it cost?**\n\nI found a great local Craigslist deal on the JL MicroSub+ at $350 cash. I did have to get a replacement [cable connector](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/acp-acs-pp-ca-rp-car-audio-microsub-amplified-subwoofer-systems-48031) and a new subwoofer [speaker grill](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/sgr-12tw1-car-audio-subwoofer-grilles-492177) since his was rather beaten up when I picked up the box. The cable connectors are great because with simple quick disconnects, the whole unit comes out of the car for times when I need the storage space. So for $395, I was able to acquire a \u001clike brand new\u001d sub that normally costs $630!\n\n**How does the JL MicroSub+ sound?**\n\nBoy is it loud! At first, being excited about having a big powerful subwoofer, I had the gain set to about 50% and the crossover set to 80Hz. That was way too high and now it\u0019s the gain is set to 20% and sounds much more balanced and musical.\n\nThe subwoofer hits quite low and hits hard. Bass heavy/forward music like Dr. Dre, Two Feet (check [Two Feet](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3dt6lj?si=_wF23BssRfmaK8Ww2WYbcg) out, so good), Elohim and Michael Jackson are quite impressive and sounds as they should, if not too much bass if anything.\n\nMore critical listening tracks like Jennifer Warnes\u0019 \u001cBird On A Wire\u001d still sound great and the subwoofer doesn\u0019t overpower or get in the way of the music at all. It\u0019s almost surprising since the \u001cbass heavy\u001d music is incredibly bass-y.\n\nNormal music that I listen to... The Cure, New Order, Rush and Echo and the Bunnymen sound just as they should. Clean mid bass which the Tesla already did well but much stronger kick drums and fuller sound.\n\nI may add JL\u0019s remote bass control knob after listening to it \u001cas is\u001d for the next couple of weeks but for now I think I can go without it as I\u0019m very happy with how it\u0019s sounding over the last 2 days.\n\nI also had planned to swap out the front 7\u001d woofers, 4\u001d midrange and tweeters to Focal components but I think I\u0019m super satisfied with just the subwoofer upgrade and will consider this chapter done. But this ain\u0019t my first rodeo so who knows, LOL.\n\nAlso, thank you to everyone on this sub-Reddit for answering questions I had over the past few weeks as I have been deciding which path to take.",

      "title": "Excessive \"vehicle standby\" battery drain?",
      "text": "Recently my 2022 Tesla Model 3 LR has been experiencing, what I believe to be, excessive battery drain while the car is parked and not in use. There are periods of time where I do not drive my car for a few days and it just sits there unplugged and with sentry mode turned off. When I first got the car I had sentry mode turned on at all times, but would notice roughly 3% battery drain per day (presumably due to sentry mode). Once I turned off sentry, this battery drain was reduced significantly to less than 1% per day. However, recently I've noticed significant battery drain, to the tune of roughly 0.2% per hour. Thanks to the recent Tesla software update, I'm able to see that the consumption is coming from the \"vehicle standby\" section, as seen in the image attached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[10.2&amp;#37; battery drain over a 51 hour period of car being parked without sentry mode nor opening the Tesla app on my phone](https://preview.redd.it/i00o7smx174a1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28fa2cc50eda41c86b9b40b0a427fe9ea465670)\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this as well? If so, does anyone have a solution? I find Tesla's solution of \"reduce energy loss while parked by keeping Model3 plugged in\" to be laughable. That is not a solution at all. The real solution is to figure out what in your software is causing this to happen as there was little to no battery drain for a good few months before I recently started to notice this issue. I'm assuming it's a recent software update that has introduced a bug because I only noticed this issue in the last 2 weeks and I've had the car for a little over 2 months where this issue was not present. For reference, I'm in southern California and low temperatures of around 50F where I live.\n\nI just find it crazy that the car was able to sit in park for roughly 51 hours with sentry mode OFF and still drain the battery as much as driving 30-35 miles would.  \n\n\nEdit : After a bit of research, I found a post talking about how many users have reported an issue where after a software update the car wouldn't be able to go into sleep mode. The solution was to hard restart the car, which I've now done and will report back results in a few days. \n\nDecember 11, 2022 update:\nEither a recent software update I installed several days ago or car reboot did the trick as now the vehicle standby battery consumption is back to normal of around -0.35% per 24 hours.",

      "title": "12V Battery Failure - My Story",
      "text": "So I experienced a catastrophic 12V battery failure that led to full vehicle shut down.  Unable to access interior of vehicle (doors/trunk).  Jumping resulted in no response whatsoever.  Owner supplied NEW battery resulted in no response whatsoever, so I had to wait 48 hours for mobile tech to arrive and attempt fix.  The car was parked in my garage and connected to the wall charger when this happened, and I got a 12v warning 5 hours before complete failure when I wasn't home.  It is a 2020 M3P w/ 34k miles.  Failure occurred Monday afternoon, repair took place Wednesday night.\n\nThis is a recount of the repair experience upon Mobile Service arrival:\n\nMobile tech was awesome dude.  I had the frunk open (tow hook 12v power to pop frunk).  I removed the covers and detached the bracket only so he could get in quickly and do his thing.  He appreciated that.  He put the new battery in and the vehicle did not respond.  He looked over the logs on his laptop and saw a string of very worrying BMS errors.  He did not have any special tricks to get into the interior of the vehicle except for a coat hanger.  You read that right, a coat hanger.\n\nHe put a little airbag thing between the driver side window and the weather steal just ahead of the downward facing camera at the B-pillar.  He expanded the gap just enough to fish a coat hanger in there to attempt to grab the manual door release.  He was successful after several attempts and about 15 minutes of trying.  His goal was to achieve access to the interior of the vehicle so we could gain access to the trunk from the back seat and release the (still attached) wall charging cable to prepare the car for a tow to the service center.\n\nI climbed into the car to get to the trunk to pop it (since I'm smaller and more limber than the tech, I offered to do it).  Once I climbed in the car's computers woke up (coincidence only - the tech said it was probably in the process of waking up once we popped the door open).  The car woke up, and everything appeared normal.  To be sure the worrying error messages were associated with the faulty 12v battery, the tech disconnected the 12v wire under the back seat, disconnected the new 12v battery to affect a full system reset.  Boom, no errors.  He also did a manual steering wheel computer restart after this to do a double-check.  Again, no errors.  Car is operating as normal.\n\nLessons learned?  As soon as you get a 12v warning - deal with it immediately.  Roll down the windows just in case if you can't immediately get to the service center.  Do not allow the car to go to sleep if you can avoid it.  Tech stated they have a revised battery that they installed that he hasn't seen the same issues.  My battery was bulging at both sides and looking pretty rough, though not leaking.  Internal cells likely trash.  The voltage read 12.6 volts, but I think the car went into \"safe mode\" to protect itself from further damage either intentionally or out of confusion because the 12v battery powers the computer.",

      "title": "Model 3P+ owner thoughts - Part 2",
      "text": "I recently submitted a summary of my experience with a Model 3P+ about [three weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/dc29ys/model_3p_received_the_good_and_the_bad_personal/). It was mostly a positive experience (as I had hoped for and expected), though I had a few gripes as well.\n\nWell, since then, I have driven on four hour trips, supercharged, and driven around central London, so I have a little more insight I thought some of you may appreciate.\n\n**Thoughts on Autopilot**\n\nThis deserves a section to itself. I've always been someone who has been a little skeptical of autopilot. Like some of you, I have fairly strong feelings that completely autonomous autopilot is further away than Musk would like to think (I also disagreed with Musk regarding the whole battery swap project but I digress). Even if the AI gets there, I'm not convinced the Model 3 currently even has the necessary cameras for a full diagnosis of its surroundings (e.g: at the back, and looking to the side). Too many corner cases, a bit like designing hundreds of fluffer bots perhaps.\n\nWith that said, I had a good feeling when my insurance company asked if I had autopilot in my car as it apparently REDUCES the premium. And as it turns out, driving on even the low-end autopilot (non-FSD since I didn't want to pay £7000) was a dream. Long stretches of motorway covering over 50 miles felt like half that. Where I usually would arrive at my destination exhausted and stressed due to driving for four hours, instead, I was energized and even a little elated.\n\nSome people here have expressed the idea that relying on autopilot can be dangerous, especially if the driver overestimates its abilities. There is valid reason for that concern, and some people may be a bit wreckless in that respect. But personally, I felt that we both COMPLEMENTED each other's ability. I was like a teacher watching over the autopilot, making sure it was doing the right thing. And for 99.9% of the time, that's exactly what happened. AP delivered almost flawlessly, not swerving, or panicking if someone cut in front of me. On the occasions where I needed to take over, such as at roundabouts or changing lanes to turn off, it was a simple push up of the right stalk, a nice little double tone, and I had full control again. Even without pushing the right stalk, I can override the steering, braking or acceleration easily. People often talk about the constant nags. Yeah I got a fair few, but I didn't feel that they overly impeded my experience. I wish it wouldn't nag at all though when going less than say 5mph.\n\nThere were a couple of occasions where things got slightly iffy. Once it got a little closer to the side of a lorry than I was comfortable with. Also a lane was gradually forming into two lanes, and the autopilot thought it was still a single lane. Might it have recognized its error and moved to the left? Perhaps, but I didn't want to find out as traffic was already coming up on the right. In tight messy roadwork-type situations, I also took full control as I don't fully trust AP in those situations. Even then, I often used traffic aware cruise control (right stalk down once), and found that great too (and no nags to boot!).\n\n**Thoughts on maps / navigation**\n\nI've tried around ten sat navs in the past, including TomTom, Garmin, Google maps, and other Android phone apps, and they've all had their flaws. Tesla's had flaws too, but I was surprised at how much I loved the giant map on the Tesla screen. As you're approaching a complex junction or multi-lane roundabout, it allows you to instantly pinch zoom far in advance so you can see what you're getting. For unfamiliar routes, this is very handy as you instantly see the whole roundabout taking up the full screen, very smooth with almost no delay. Standard features are included such as what lane you should be in or the distance to the next turn-off, though sometimes it wouldn't give the full information such as the town or the name of the 'A' road as well as its more traditional name.\n\nWith the voice activation (click of thumb wheel), I even said \"drive to &lt;place&gt; gym\", and it came up on the Satnav immediately. This can be done whilst driving so you don't have to look for somewhere to stop.\n\nIt's nice how it can take realtime traffic into account, and can presumably change route on the fly too. I don't have enough information to see how well it judges the situation to assess how well that performs however.\n\n**Driving around London**\n\nEven on a Sunday, driving around London can be a nightmare with impatient drivers cutting in front or pedestrians/cyclists that appear to WANT to get run over, nevermind the perversely designed multiple-lane streets with no or faded markings that are haphazardly merging into each other. No wonder so many people will refuse to drive in London.\n\nWith that said, the Model 3 made what would usually be a nightmare into something still daunting, but more manageable in many instances. This is primarily due to the Model 3's quick getaway speed (no faffing around with gears/clutch/handbrake). That allows someone who is unsure of the correct lane to whisk forwards in advance without other drivers seemingly doing their best to prevent you from changing lane, resulting in less hesitation and more decisive manoeuvres. In parking situations I can't stress how lovely the giant rear-view camera is, along with showing you the number of inches away you are from obstacles shown on the screen car's outline.\n\nWith the lack of engine noise, and the windows slightly ajar you also have a better sense of your surroundings as you can hear vehicles approaching behind or to the side of you.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n - A small sporadic rattle has appeared at the front and stops if I pull the monitor towards me. I'll probably take this in to the service centre soon.\n\n - A brief mention goes to the music system is incredible too (hooked my phone up via bluetooth!).\n\n - Noise via the wheels is persistent on some road surfaces. I'm guessing it's probably worse than the average car around this price range, or potentially even half the price. I feel the lack of vibration and engine noise more than compensates.\n\n - Love the solid feel of the doors and how you can close them by the window.\n\n - It's tempting to use more acceleration than is necessary, and this eats into the battery more than you expect. On just one occasion, Tesla advised me to stay below 70mph to reach my destination, which I obliged.\n\n - I wish there was a feature to prevent going backwards whilst driving slowly on a hill (without using the brake hill-hold feature), or to prevent going forwards whilst in reverse.\n\n - The one pedal driving is sublime - no wonder people keep raving about it. Also gives you that extra deceleration in the time it takes you to move your foot from the acceleration pedal to the brake pedal (Which is less often than a normal car).\n\n - Screen strangely cut out for about 10 seconds once (but still let me drive). No big deal.\n\n - On a multi-storey car park, I lightly scraped the undercarriage's plastic part in front of the back wheels due to the 3P's low suspension. It was already a bit frayed previously though thanks to general sandblasting I presume.\n\n - Love how the left thumbwheel controls the radio volume/station whilst the right thumbwheel generally controls the max autopilot's / cruise-control's speed, and its distance in car-lengths that it should maintain.\n\n - I've put a towel down in the boot area as I had drips fall down there after heavy rain when I opened the boot up. Last thing I want is damp issues in my Model 3.\n\n**Overall**\n\nLove the car even more than ever now. Driving for hours is quite a fun experience instead of a chore. Even in non-recirculation mode, it's worth mentioning that only twice did I ever smell fumes from other vehicles. I LOVE that as I hate driving with smelly fumes in my car. There was one occasion where a van was belching fumes at me, and it was so lovely to (safely) race past him to avoid any more of that crap. Merging and allowing other cars to merge is so much easier now due to the instant torque.\n\nI've said before: I will never buy another car again that does anything slower than 0-60 in 4 seconds (and maybe even 3). It's a liberating experience, and that's coming from what is usually a pretty conservative driver who never gets road rage. My mate who has never driven an EV before and who experienced driving my Model 3 even said something along the lines of \"Let's just throw all ICE cars into a giant fire and give everyone Teslas\". I think that's a little much, but I think I know what his next car purchase will be.",

      "title": "Hello and Goodbye to my Brand New Model 3 SR+",
      "text": "**TL;DR** \n\nMy Model 3 became undrivable at just under 48 hours of ownership and 409 miles. Roadside towed it 3.5 hours away to the closest service center. Service center reconnected high voltage wires and replaced 12v battery. Replaced Windshield that was also defective. Service won't deliver it back to me in OKC. Car now works. Tesla CS not great. Keeping Car. Much Wow. \n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a whirlwind of a not even 48 hours since taking delivery of my brand new 2020 Model 3 SR+. I've experienced all the emotions from pure excitement/bliss to anger/frustration over the course of these 48 hours.\n\nI drove up from OKC to Kansas City on Saturday to take delivery. I figured it'd be a great experience getting used to the car, testing out the supercharging network, etc.\n\nThe journey begins with driving the vehicle off the lot. Immediately after getting onto the road, I noticed what I can only explain as a distortion in the front windshield. I chalked it up to my sunglasses having a smudge or just needing to get acclimated to the giant front windshield and the curve of it. About an hour into my trip home however, as i'm readjusting my position in the car to get more comfortable, I notice that this distortion is really only occurring right at the driver eye level. Figured as soon as I got home i'd schedule a mobile service appointment to get the glass taken care of.\n\nAt about the 150 mile in, the real fun began. I was pulling off of the highway to the supercharger in emporia, where the vehicle flashed a message 'Vehicle may not restart, Service is required message'. It stayed on the screen for about 30 seconds, then disappeared.. not to be seen again for the rest of the trip home.\n\nSunday was fine, only annoyed by the glass. Drove it around locally for maybe 20 miles with no issue and no messages on the dash.\n\nToday (Monday) rolled around and the ominous 'Vehicle May not Restart. Service Required' message appeared again. This time not going away, I decided to park and call Tesla Roadside to troubleshoot. Since the vehicle technically was still drivable, I went through the 'non-emergency' phone tree while parked and sat on hold. About 15 minutes into hold, the vehicle made a loud 'clunk', shut off and a new message appeared stating 'Electrical System power reduced. Vehicle may shut down unexpectedly' .\n\nAt this point the car was no longer drivable. Would not power up. I called Roadside back on the 'emergency line' and immediately after looking at the error they dispatched a tow truck to bring it to the Dallas service center 3.5 hours away.\n\nSo within 48 hours and only 409 miles on the car i'm already saying goodbye to my new model 3.\n\nIf i'm being honest, i'm pretty bummed. I've lived vicariously through you all for years! I realize this isn't a typical experience, but regardless it's not been a great one so far.\n\nI'll keep you guys posted along the journey to repair or return. I've also reached out to my Delivery Support Specialist, but haven't heard back yet (to be fair it's only been about an hour since my call). Ultimately I know I have options, including the drastic measure of returning the vehicle since we're well within the 7 day and 1,000 mile window.\n\nInterested in hearing your thoughts/opinions/suggestions or if anyone else has shared a similar experience so early into ownership.\n\nBe well.\n\n\\------\n\n# UPDATE 8/11 (AM)\n\nTesla Roadside dispatched a tow truck from Dallas. The truck arrived four hours after my call to roadside.\n\nI was able to connect with my delivery support specialist and he was super understanding. Mentioned escalating the issue to the delivery team in Kansas City at around 1pm yesterday, but I haven\u0019t yet heard from them.\n\nShortly after the truck was in-route back to Dallas I received an automated text from Tesla Service:\n\n&gt;Hello! This is Tesla Service. Loaner vehicles are subject to availability at check-in. If unavailable, Uber credits will be provided upon request. Any other alternate transportation would be at owner's expense.\n\nI understand this is an automated message, but it\u0019s slightly confusing/unaccommodating, given the situation. Soo did I just check-in to my appointment? Do I have to drive to Dallas to get a loaner? The process seems a bit fragmented for someone not close to a service center. I\u0019m not reading too much into this message at this point since I haven\u0019t talked to a human at Dallas Service or Kansas City Delivery.\n\nReceived a text from the tow company at 9pm that the vehicle had been dropped off at Tesla service.\n\nAt 11:30pm I received an automated email saying that parts had been ordered for my vehicle.\n\nASY,12V BATT AND VENT PLUG,M3 Part #: 1129182-00-B\n\nI\u0019m curious if this part order was automatically generated because the battery died (I can no longer connect to vehicle via tesla app). Or if a tech was genuinely looking at the vehicle at 11:30pm\n\nThe email also stated an appointment was scheduled for 11:56pm CT (yes pm). (I doubt that\u0019s a real scheduled appointment time.. but we\u0019ll see)\n\n# UPDATE 8/11 (PM)\n\nDiagnosis will not be completed until tomorrow (8/12) . At that point there should be some sort of ETA on repair. The Delivery Team in KC helped coordinate with Dallas service on a rental vehicle from a local rental car agency in the meantime. I also inquired about an exchange of the vehicle (still a little ahead of myself here, not knowing what the issue is but also wanted to see what my options were) and this was the response:\n\n&gt;If you do wish to proceed with returning your Model 3 we can have our Dallas team process that. Refunds typically take 14-30 days and we unfortunately won\u0019t be able to \u001cswap\u001d another Model 3 with yours(and you\u0019ll unfortunately have to wait 12 months before ordering the same Model 3 trim).\n\nI understand the reason for the rule (discourage abuse of policy as 'rental' vehicle, asking for a swap for minor cosmetic issues, etc, but it also seems odd in a scenario such as this to essentially ban a real customer who just wants a car of the same trim level that drives...\n\n# UPDATE 8/12 (AM)\n\nI haven't received any formal updates from Tesla yet this morning, but I can now connect to the vehicle via the mobile app (was not able to do that once the vehicle died).\n\nTelsa also provided me with a rental vehicle here in OKC in lieu of Uber Credits, which I picked up this AM.\n\n# UPDATE 8/13 (PM)\n\nWas contacted by the Plano, TX Service center to let me know they found the root cause of the issue. A connector in the high-voltage loop was not securely fastened from the factory. They reattached/secured it as well as checked all other connections at the front of the vehicle. \n\nBecause the high voltage loop shut off for safety, it sounds like the 12v also died at some point in transport and they also replaced that.\n\nAside from that, they did a diagnostic on the windshield and confirmed a manufacturing defect... and did a full replacement.\n\nMy Model 3 is now ready for pickup.. yes pickup.. Unfortunately I wrongly assumed they'd be delivering it back to me here in OKC. Kinda crazy i'll have to drive 7 hours RT, to pick up the vehicle. I guess my expectations were maybe a little too high :) .\n\nIn the end I have decided to keep the Model 3 given the issues are relatively minor, and seem to have been corrected. If issues continue to be persistent, I know there is still recourse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some photos for your viewing pleasure:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iv1w5ju45eg51.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12323f6543dff4a32befc40ede352df41281f0d4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jia3yrt45eg51.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f4f7b0080bffbabb8558226ca10b941740b17a\n\n[Away she goes :\\(](https://preview.redd.it/ryb3c9ow5eg51.jpg?width=827&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82a4c23457d004e30ee982cf9f8ee9b9ef947c2)",

      "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster.  Been mulling over a Model 3 purchase for years (with placed and canceled reservations along the way) but the timing finally felt right.  Was able to reserve a M3P at my local dealership at the lowest price I've seen - $47,920.  Will be able to fully benefit from the $7,500 federal credit and $3,500 state refund.  I also have a NEMA 14-50 in my garage as I pathetically had it installed years ago anticipating this purchase.  I know that I'll have to get a set of wheels/tires for New England winters - was thinking the T Sportline 19\" rims with Michelin CrossClimate2's.\n\nI'm also aware that Highland has been announced.  I don't think we'll see it at this price point any time soon, no performance variant has been announced, and I wasn't impressed with many of the improvements.  The whole \"no stalks\" thing seems to be a form over function sacrifice.\n\nIs there anything that I should keep in mind for delivery day? I'm concerned that the lower than average price for this vehicle trim means there's something wrong with the vehicle that will become immediately apparent to me.  Does it mean that others have rejected this vehicle? The dealership has assured me that the lower price is merely an indicator that the car has been sitting on the lot for a while.  Should I be concerned about battery degradation?\n\nAny advice or tips would be appreciated.\n\nBefore you guys destroy my inbox, I've already used a referral code.",

      "text": "Don't forget if you installed a charging setup in 2020, you can get a 30% credit on your 2020 Federal tax return.  This includes anything from a NEMA 14-50 outlet install to a full Wall Connector install for Tesla owners.  If you purchase a second mobile connector for use with a NEMA 14-50 outlet, this will count too.\n\nOriginally the extension of the tax credit went through Dec 31 2020, but now it has been updated to end on Dec 31 2021.  So if you still haven't installed charging yet, you have all of this year to do it and then file on your 2021 federal taxes.    As you can see here, you can still apply for installations as early as 2017.  So if you have put in electrical vehicle charging in 2017 through 2019, you can do so.  However, you need to file an amended tax return to claim your charging credit.  This includes hardware and installation costs. Make sure you keep copies of all your receipts in case you need them for proof.   Remember to contact a tax professional if you have any further questions about this tax credit and how it applies to your situation.  If you use a tax program like Turbotax, make sure to fill this form out. \n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/aKX1BKeXM6U](https://youtu.be/aKX1BKeXM6U) \n\n[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8911.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8911.pdf)\n\n[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8911.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8911.pdf)",

      "text": "What a year, I drive a lot in Houston for my job and this car has been a great investment. Especially when compared to my previous vehicle(Toyota Tundra). It has been economically ideal and fun at the same time which I didn\u0019t know were things that could go hand in hand. \n\nI do have a couple negatives after this first year however, mainly pertaining to Teslas Insurance, especially after adding the new night driving factor. My score plummeted from a 98-99 to an 88-89 within a couple nights of night driving. Skyrocketing my $170 premium to $270. On top of that, I have to drive like an old man to keep my 88-89 score because I\u0019d rather it not go any lower than that. I will definitely be looking for other routes for insurance soon due to this. \n\nOther con is the battery degradation, my battery has already degraded 7% according to the Tessie app, which I suppose is understandable considering the amount of driving I\u0019ve done. \n\nLast annoying con is the screen not connecting to the internet, making it not possible to use my map unless I reboot it. This occurs to me at least every other day, sometimes every day.",

      "title": "2 Years and 110k km review in a cold, Canadian prairies climate",
      "text": "We bought an EV 2 years ago and it seems like everywhere we go, people are really interested in it. I did a 1 year, 53k km review that can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/zruis8/1_year_and_53k_km_with_an_ev_in_saskatchewan/) It goes into the background about why we decided to go the route we did, which EV's we considered, etc. Basically we drive a lot and were spending a ridiculous amount on fuel so wanted to reduce our costs. We have done that.\n\nWe decided to purchase a Tesla Model 3 because it was the cheapest AWD EV we could get and the Tesla fast charging (Level 3) infrastructure is vastly superior to anything else.\n\nWhen charging at home, we use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle. We just bought a couple adaptors for it. We installed a NEMA 14-50 plug in the garage. We did this ourselves for material cost, which was about $75. At the max 32 amps, it charges at 10% an hour. We park in a heated (5C) garage year round, but that is not a requirement.\n\nFor the life of the vehicle, we are averaging 208 Wh/km. Typical home power costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering the climate here. We have added solar to our home, so we try to charge as much as possible when the sun is shining, reducing our cost even more when we can.\n\nMore affordable EV's are constantly being released, but they are still very hard to get in Saskatchewan. The fast charging infrastructure has vastly improved since we got the vehicle. Tesla is officially opening up their fast charging network to Ford and GM in February 2024, which will be a massive step forward for those companies. Most other manufacturers are adopting the Tesla (NACS) charge port in the coming years which will definitely help the viability of those EV's here in SK.\n\nUnfortunately, Tesla has greatly increased the fast charging costs. Throughout SK it is now $0.60/kWh, or 4x as expensive as home charging. There are some other fast chargers that can be cheaper than the Tesla network. Even so, with gas prices declining, if exclusively fast charging on a trip, an EV is not near as cheap to run as they used to be. It is a similar usage cost to a Honda Civic if you are exclusively fast charging.\n\nFast chargers are constantly being built, but we absolutely need a lot more. More Level 2 chargers, which are relatively cheap to install, are needed at destinations like golf courses, rec centers, museums, all the types of places that out of towners frequent. Saskatchewan does have a substantial advantage in that Level 1 chargers already exist at most work places, hotels, etc. Being prepared for a lot of block heaters has its advantages.\n\nObviously the major concern people have with EV's is winter driving. I do not have any concerns any more. If I was constantly doing long distance, remote trips, especially if towing, obviously an EV is not ideal. However, for the normal commuter or long distance driver, there really should not be a worry. I think If your commute is 250km or less, an EV really is ideal. I actually prefer driving our EV in the winter now. It instantly blows warm air, you don't have to wait for an engine to warm up before creating heat. Below about -35C when travelling at highway speeds, it isn't hot. But it easily keeps the interior at 20C and works just as well as a regular vehicle.\n\nThe ability to control the vehicle through an app, for free, is awesome. We set our departure time and the cabin and battery are warm and ready at that time. You can also set your charging times, charging % limit, view charging stats and really do almost anything through the app. It really does work great.\n\nOur first year with the vehicle we have zero issues. The past year, we have had some. All work was done at the service center in Saskatoon. They have been awesome to deal with. The heat pump failed and was replaced under warranty. The front suspension also was creaking and was fully replaced under warranty. Neither of these was a surprise as they were common issues at the time. We also had a charge port replaced as the locking mechanism was sticking. The rear motor oil pump was also replaced. These were all replaced under warranty for free. All items were replaced with updated items that hopefully have fixed the problems. So far we haven't had any further issues.\n\nMaintenance has been minimal. I change the cabin air filters 2 or 3 times a year because we live on gravel. I get the brakes serviced annually. That is all that we have for maintenance.\n\nTo summarize, we are very happy with our EV. While it hasn't been perfect and it takes more planning on trips, it really works great for us. It is crazy cheap to drive, especially when charging at home. That is huge for us because we obviously drive a lot. I think we will always have at least 1 EV as our main commuter vehicle. We have been really happy with it",

      "title": "Recent 2022 Preowned Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD purchase from Tesla experience",
      "text": "I thought I would detail my recent preowned purchase experience from Tesla. I purchased a 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD via their website for \\~$32k (had 27k miles and paid $500 to ship it). I picked up in late May 2024. Tesla has a broad definition of acceptable conditions for a used vehicle (here: https://www.tesla.com/support/ordering-used-tesla#vehicle-condition), so it is a bit of a risk when purchasing (given there are no pictures of the vehicle before buying). I am more flexible when it comes to vehicle condition when I feel like I'm getting a great deal (like here vs. almost $50-60k for a comparable new version). I think a lightly used Tesla Model 3 may be the best car deal out there right now.\n\n \n\n**The good:**\n\nExterior of the vehicle was very good overall. It had 5 small scratches that went to the metal (less than .25 inches in length), but the hood / front bumper are perfect.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle has several light scratches on the back of the driver\u0019s seat, but the front seats are nearly perfect and the front dash looks great.\n\nThe screen was in perfect condition.\n\nThe vehicle included both FSD and acceleration boost with the purchase price.\n\nIt had new ties / rims. They were flawless.\n\nIncluded car mats.\n\nTesla includes an extra 1 year of general vehicle warranty with purchase.\n\nThe vehicle itself is amazing. Amazing acceleration, technology, comfort, everything. Sometimes I find myself opening my garage door just to look at it (feel funny typing this). :)\n\n \n\n**The bad:**\n\nThere is a persistent rattle / window crackle type of noise coming from the passenger side windows at speeds above 50 mph and I tried the heavy silicone spray fix per YouTube videos, but to no avail. I have a service appointment (couldn't get in until mid-July!) to address this. I have no idea if they'll charge me, but b/c I just got the vehicle, I am going to try and resolve as it is annoying and doesn't fall under ANY of the expected noises listed on the Tesla website (yes, I listened to all of them).\n\nOne of the wheel covers was cracked.\n\nI cannot tell what the actual battery degradation is, but I don't think anyone can without going into the service mode and burning a full day of time. I've researched multiple threads here, https://tesla-info.com/ and https://teslamotorsclub.com/ and the best accessible method I've found is utilizing the Energy screen consumption info (watt/mile consumption X range) / Battery % = usable capacity / useable capacity at new (79 kWh usable, 82 kWh total). With 27k miles, I get anywhere from 7 to 11% degradation. I think this is reasonable, but I don't know and would be open to suggestions from the community on how I can figure it out. Would be nice to try and recalibrate the BMS, but after looking at what seems like a million YouTube videos, I'm not sure it's worth the effort.\n\n \n\n**Things I've purchased after I picked it up:**\n\nMobile charger\n\nfront storage bin\n\nmatte screen protector\n\n512 GB USB drive\n\ntrunk mat\n\ntrunk bag hook\n\nofficial Tesla touch up paint\n\n1 new wheel cover \n\nRim touchup paint\n\nabout 10 car cleaning / care products.\n\nI curbed my rim about a week into ownership. :( I have fixed this and am aware of aftermarket wheel cover options, but I couldn't believe how easy it was when it happened.\n\n \n\nI'm still figuring out what additional accessories to buy, features to learn, but overall, despite a few issues, I am 100% in love with this car and will never go back to an ICE vehicle again as it perfectly suits my needs now and in the future. I understand why people are so passionate about these cars.\n\n \n\nHope this was helpful to someone thinking of taking the plunge, and please note the Tesla advisor I worked with said my car was in good condition overall and they have had some poor condition vehicles in the past that customers have refused. I don't know how to reassure anyone that wants to go the preowned route via Tesla, b/c Tesla makes it harder than it should be. If I had to guess, Tesla wants to invest the least amount of effort in getting these cars sold and are willing to sell at a lower price as a result. If they would take a few photos and highlight any issues they don't intend to resolve, I think it would go a long way (including battery health), but I don't see that happening anytime soon.\n\n \n\nTake care and happy motoring.",

As the result, the car is dirty in all just about all good pictures. The car is ceramic-coated, and gets a thorough hand-wash after every trip.\n\nMany people still have concerns about the electric cars and the ability to travel long distance. I think this would be true for any other brand other than Tesla. The massive supercharger network just about eliminates any kind of range anxiety as long as you take a few minutes to plan out your trip in advance. We have travelled to some pretty remote locations, and the lowest it has gotten to was around 30 miles or 10% of battery range.\n\nI'm not a professional photographer and all the photos here are taken with iPhone XS Max, so please excuse the non-perfect quality.

      "text": " Our Model 3 a year ago and its hard to find reviews for these cars in areas that get cold. Really cold. -40 cold. So I figured I would write a review. And discuss our costs vs the ICE vehicle we previously owned.\n\nWe picked up a new, 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range on December 31 and have just passed 53000km. So far it has been outstanding, performing incredibly well. We\u0019ve added PPF to the entire front, tinted windows in the rear, Rally Armor flaps, Mountain Pass Performance skid plate and winter wheels with Michelin X-Ice Snow winter tires. We keep the hub caps on the standard wheels in the summer to increase efficiency.\n\nWe live about 35km out of town, going to town at least twice a day during the week for daycare. We also do a 900km round trip quite often. We had 2 front facing car seats when we bought it, but now one kid is in a booster.\n\nOur previous vehicle was a 2010 Lexus RX350 that was paid off. Fuel costs were getting too high so we decided to take the plunge to an electric. We used money we got from the sale of the vehicle as a down payment on the new one. I\u0019m 6ft tall with relatively long legs. I am more comfortable in the Model 3 than I was in the RX350.\n\nOriginally was expecting to buy a Chevrolet Bolt EUV, but with the recalls we couldn\u0019t buy one. We then decided that AWD was a requirement considering where we live and my wife strongly prefers it. Alternatives we considered were the VW ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mach-E. The wait for the Hyundai and VW were likely minimum 2 years and the local Ford dealer is not the best combined with prices that we thought were too high. Ground clearance wasn\u0019t a huge factor as we have a truck that I drive if it snows too much. And the Tesla Supercharging network is infinitely better than anything else in the prairies right now.\n\nThe car is parked in a heated (5C) garage year round. I installed a NEMA 14-50 outlet and charge at a max of 18 amps. We could charge at up to 32 amps, but it doesn't need to be that fast. We just use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle and a 14-50 adaptor. It\u0019s always plugged in and the battery is set to a maximum charge of 80%. In the winter, we schedule our departure time using the app. \n\nOur lifetime average is 207 Wh/km. Power at home costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering, especially considering the climate here.\n\nNow the main reason why we bought the car, to save money. We obviously drive a lot, way more than normal which made the math simple to justify. Our total public charging costs for the year are $1137. Our home power usage increased by about 9700 kWh, or $1455. We also used some free chargers. That gives us a total power cost of $2592. In our previous vehicle we averaged 13L/100km of premium fuel. At a conservative estimate of $1.75/L fuel price for the year, that works out to a total fuel cost of $12,057. (13L\\*$1.75 = $22.75/100km. 53000/100 = 530. 530\\*22.75 = $12,057). Our previous vehicle would have very conservatively required $1000 in maintenance to give us an annual cost of $13,057. Our total maintenance cost for our EV for the year was $150 for a brake service and cabin air filters. In our 1 year with an EV, we have saved at least $10,315 in driving cost. (($12,057 + $1000) - ($2592+$150) = $10,315). Including the price of our car payment, we have still saved over $2700 this year. And it actually is even more than that, if you were to properly factor in paying for gas (100% depreciation) vs paying for the car (much less than 100% depreciation).\n\nThe one concern everyone seems to have is the heat. It been great except when below -35C (-31F) on the highway. Sometimes at that temperature it\u0019s great, but other times it\u0019s just ok. It is always plenty good enough, even at those temperatures. In my experience, it is just as good below -35C as other vehicles I have had (Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra, Lexus RX350, Dodge Ram, to name a few) and better than others, like our previous Honda Civic. The BEST part about the heat, is that it is instant. You don't have to wait for the engine to warm up before it starts throwing heat. You turn it on with the app and in 5 minutes at -35C, the interior is toasty warm. Its incredible.\n\nIn summary, we have saved over $2700 this year by purchasing a new EV. We are extremely happy about the purchase! Because we drive so much, its absolutely made sense to purchase it. I still love driving it and highly recommend it to everyone. When we get solar in the spring, our operating costs will be even less. Excited for that!",

      "text": "2021 December Model 3 SR+ with 47,230 miles. About two weeks ago I received a notification with error message \"Maximum charge level reached Reduced maximum charge level - Schedule service\" \n\nService center did a remote diagnostic, and recommended to replace HV Battery. Today I received a call with the option to upgrade to LFP battery and suspension. I accepted. \n\nPotential benefits according to the Service Center: \n\n1. More range,\n2. Recommended to charge to 100% daily compared to 80% (with your current battery)\n3. Optimized energy capacity retention overtime even when charging to 100% every day\n\n\"The LFP battery is heavier which may increase the 0 to 60 mph acceleration time by around 0.5\nseconds. The vehicle dynamics will stay optimal as Tesla service will upgrade your suspension\nsprings and dampers along with a 4 wheel alignment\".\n\n\nEverything is covered under warranty. \n\nHas anyone else have similar experience?\n\nIf yes, did you notice any difference in the vehicle driving experience?\n\nUPDATE:\nService has been completed. It took exactly 1month from placing the battery on order, receiving and installing. I will be picking up the car today.

      "text": "This was my second time supercharging. I navigated to SC#1. By the time I got there it was too busy. So I drove to SC#2 6 miles away. All stalls were available. The battery was preconditioned for sure (at least 30 min of preconditioning). I plugged in. And it quickly got to 254kw! It charged fasssst. And I assume charging that fast produces a lot of wasted heat. Charger and car fans were running at high speed. And kind of loud. And when I unplugged and drove off. Seems like cabin heating was extra warm (still set to 66 with 34 outside). There were some pops and crackles (cooling battery would explain the sounds) And I smelled little bit of & hot metal smell. Or&. I dunno. It wasn\u0019t anything like melting plastic. No fumes. It king of smelled like resistive space heater when it\u0019s first turn on. I know manual says that there might be sounds when supercharging. But I was kind of surprised how much of \u001cdrama\u001d there was. \nI drove another 1.5 hrs after that and everything was normal. \nSo I\u0019m assuming it\u0019s all normal.

      "text": "My family just completed a 2300-mile week-long trip in a 2021 M3 LR and I hope this report helps someone who is in the market for a Tesla.\n\nTLDR: No regrets, but a Model Y may be better for long trips. Superchargers are what makes a Tesla the only rational choice for an electric vehicle purchase.\n\nWe began in the Portland Oregon area and headed down to Los Angeles California, visited with family, saw some sights, then headed home.\n\nThe South bound trip was split over 2 days with a stop on the Bay Area. The return leg was a massive one day, 17.5 hour drive.\n\nWe are a family of 4. Two adults and 2 early teens.\n\nFirst off, let me get the only true negative out of the way. The back seats in the M3 are not made for the long haul. The inability to make any adjustment leads to a lack of comfort, which makes people grumpy. This is not a fault of Tesla, rather just the fact that the M3 is a sedan. I do think that the seats generally are not as comfortable as other manufactures, but it could be my body type. I have not spent any appreciable time in a Model Y, but I imagine their ability to recline makes a big difference.\n\nPositives.\n\n* The car is smooth as butter. It is not a fatiguing car to drive.\n* Dual motors and instant torque never gets old and can extricate you from a jam that would otherwise cause stress in most ICE cars.\n* Auto Pilot is very cool and reduces fatigue. Unless you're doing 80mph at night, and it sees a piece of fabric in the road and emergency brakes. Then it's pretty stressful.\n* Room for cargo is not an issue at all. Suitcases, duffles, back packs, other crap. Still had room.\n* Superchargers are great. We all agreed that having to stop every 2 - 2.5 hours was nice. We like that we weren't confined to a gas station, and usually had better options to walk around and get food.\n\nLess positives.\n\n* There feels like too little room for the stuff that piles up on a long trip. Too small cup holders. Charging cables inconvenient for front seats. Door nooks don't hold much. My sunglasses never found a happy home.\n* Superchargers. Sometimes it felt like I was hunting for them. They were on occasion in split locations. Examples are hidden in the back of hotels, or 4 in one obvious location and 12 not obviously around a corner. We only had to wait a few minutes once, but I can see how it would be a problem hitting a bank of 8 chargers that are full and there's a line of folks waiting.\n* The battery icon on the main screen is horribly inaccurate and should be set to % or ignored completely. The energy graph is the place to look.\n* The overall impression of the superchargers is that I'm arriving at a transition in time, like when Blockbuster started getting DVD's but most people had VHS. Five years from now will be a completely different vibe.\n* Again with the superchargers... on one occasion we had to go way out of our way in Los Angeles to get a charge. It was just the location we were in, but it was the one time when it felt like a pain in the rear.\n* Lastly with the superchargers... This is where Tesla wins. I can NOT imagine trying to do that trip without their network. And I can see how opening up the network to non Tesla vehicles may cause significant backups without significant build out of the network.\n\nIn the end, it was really cool to take the car on that long of a trip. I had 1000 free miles from a referral, so the total charging cost was about $65. (I picked up a full charge at the hotel we stayed at on 2 of the days). BUT ... should we take the family on a long road trip again, we're taking our Toyota Highlander ONLY because the back seats are more comfortable. If it's 1 or 2 people or a short trip sub 500 miles...  Tesla all day long.",

      "text": "I bought this 2021 Model 3 a week ago, and yesterday I received this message (BMS_a079 Unable to charge) when I started it up in the morning, after leaving it to charge overnight on my neighbor\u0019s Tesla charger (mine is being installed today, and he\u0019s been kind enough to let me use his all week). Tried charging again last night, still getting the error message today, and the battery has now depleted to 64%. \n\nI\u0019ve got an appointment for service on Monday, and luckily the battery is still under warranty, so whatever repair needed should be covered completely. I guess I\u0019m just curious about what, ultimately, Tesla ended up doing for anyone else who has had this issue. Is it a simple repair, or can I expect a new replacement battery? If they do replace the battery, about how long will that take, assuming they\u0019ve got one in stock or can get one quickly? \n\nThis is really frustrating, as I\u0019ve only had the car a week.

It\u0019s no surprise the [EV market is expected to reach over $800 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/08/2045017/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-Market-to-Reach-802-81-Billion-Globally-by-2027-Allied-Market-Research.html)! \n\nIn this post, we\u0019ll take a tour of the following aspects of a Tesla Model 3:\n\n1. App\n2. Exterior\n3. Interior\n4. Driving\n5. Charging\n6. Safety\n7. Maintenance\n8. Community\n9. Cost\n10. Improvements\n\nHere we go.\n\n# 1. App\n\nBefore describing the car itself, I want to begin with one of the most convenient aspects of owning a Tesla: the [Tesla mobile app](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app). This serves as your primary car key and provides many remote control features.\n\nThe mobile app automatically unlocks and locks the Tesla 3 doors using bluetooth \u0014 this short-distance, keyless access is extremely convenient because it\u0019s hands-free (e.g. phone in pocket) and eliminates having to carry a physical car key.\n\nTesla does provide key FOBs but in the two years of owning my car, I\u0019ve only used them for valet parking or as a backup in my wallet, in case my phone dies. \n\n[Tesla Mobile App](https://preview.redd.it/58dwvga5s4y51.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317f6d10451adbbec6f8ac44fc17f8503bd414ea)\n\nThe Tesla mobile app complements the interior touchscreen by giving you many controls outside the car. \n\nThe long list of remote control features include lock/unlock doors/trunks, turning on the climate, control charging, valet mode, honk/flash to locate the car, set speed limit&and more.\n\nYou can even use the Summon feature to slowly drive the car in reverse or forward \u0014 think remote control toy cars \u0014 this can come in handy for water puddles or tight garages.\n\nOther neat features include the ability to send an address to your car from maps apps such as Apple and Google Maps (via the share option). You can even locate where your car is parked using the app.\n\nThese types of pragmatic, modern day tech features is what sets Tesla apart from all other car manufacturers.\n\n# 2. Exterior \n\nThe Tesla 3 is a sleek looking four door sedan, which drives like an expensive sports car.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 - Exterior, Frunk and Trunk](https://preview.redd.it/8h0tg7bgs4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad56e9c4135dacc45288284f8571e66a35542b68)\n\nThe doors have unique flush handles that are aerodynamically designed to reduce drag. You\u0019ll have to get used to giving one time instructions to first time users, such as \u001cput the thumb on the fat part of the handle and open with the rest of your hand.\u001c\n\nTesla 3 comes with two trunks, a conventional rear trunk and an innovative, front trunk (\u001cfrunk\u001d). \n\nI find the frunk extremely useful for small bags (e.g. groceries), since the incline keeps the bags from sliding around. I used to get strange looks when I opened the frunk but people seem to be getting used to it, thanks to a growing number of Teslas on the road.\n\nThe rear trunk also has lots of room with an additional compartment under the trunk\u0019s floor. You can also fold the rear seats down for longer objects (e.g. skis); I was able to fit a hybrid bicycle in there once.\n\n# 3. Interior\n\nWhen people get inside a Tesla 3 for the first time, they are often taken aback by how bare the interior is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1zpvo0ms4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62a611c636906e381a3503b728a84b3ba2554d8\n\nThen&they slowly begin to get wowed by how many features are packed in the deceptively minimalistic interior.\n\nThe Tesla 3 can comfortably seat five people, with heating in all seats. It has more legroom than conventional, internal combustion engine (gasoline) cars, since there\u0019s no transmission hump in EVs.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Minimalist Interior](https://preview.redd.it/gw6p397ns4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb614abeeedb58905b4a9d34322f45f1778cb575)\n\nWith the rear seats folded down, there\u0019s enough space to fit a twin size airbed \u0014 I have read about people sleeping overnight in their Teslas, at campgrounds.\n\nThe Tesla 3 has your basics: seats, air vents, several cup holders, multiple storage compartments, USB and 12v chargers, door locks, and window controls (auto retract for all four windows). \n\nAt the center of the front panel is a single, gorgeous 15-inch, extremely responsive, touchscreen to operate everything else (including the glovebox) \u0014 essentially your control center.\n\n[Touchscreen](https://preview.redd.it/c6hscs2ss4y51.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc20ae579abe5f6d2bcb67f47198dddc00937dbd)\n\nGetting used to having everything on a single screen takes only minutes to get comfortable with, since most of us use mobile devices these days, so it\u0019s a familiar feel.\n\nI\u0019ve personally fallen in love with the single touchscreen concept, since it feels like using a tablet (e.g. iPad) and gives the car a more airy feel, without the clutter of knobs you find in most cars.\n\nIt\u0019s baffling to me that other car manufacturers haven\u0019t realized the simple fact that consumers love their smartphones, since most cars still have a fragmented instrumentation dashboard.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto support helps but it still doesn\u0019t provide an integrated, smartphone-like, user experience (Ux) \u0014 imagine if you had part knobs and part touchscreen to operate your smartphone! \n\n[Settings](https://preview.redd.it/ghibu2dts4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a94d6a6ceb2bd2ac3716e8ff4adb93b3f7d2631)\n\nThe 15-inch touchscreen provides you access to many features, almost too many to cover in detail in this post, so I\u0019ll list them instead:\n\n* Speedometer\n* Door lock/unlock\n* Settings (glovebox, lights, locks, display, driving, Full Self-Driving (FSD)/Autopilot, navigation, safety, service, software, etc.)\n* Climate control\n* Wiper control\n* Backup camera\n* Navigation: Everything you can expect from a mapping app, with comprehensive supercharger network support built in. The satellite view is amazingly responsive!\n* Battery level, settings and consumption\n* USB connectivity/charging and 12V charging\n* Objects nearby (cars, trucks, motorcycles, signs, people, traffic lights, lane markings)\n* Dashcam \u0013 record video footage on a USB drive using Tesla\u0019s external cameras (see video at the end of this post)\n* Custom driver profiles\n* Manual/automatic garage opener via HomeLink\n* Sentry alarm system\n* Tire pressure\n* Incoming phone calls\n* Seat belt warnings\n\n[Netflix - Full Screen](https://preview.redd.it/eiu8fykus4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43a21c4af2ba34cef64474975bd53fe442135ee0)\n\nThen&there\u0019s a whole section on the screen dedicated to apps, including: \n\n* Web browser\n* Calendar (integrated with your phone with auto navigation) \n* Entertainment (with full-screen support) including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Caraoke (with a \u001cC\u001d), Atari arcade games, drawing tool, fullscreen campfire, and more.\n\nWith so many entertainment options, you will have to find reasons to get bored on supercharger stops. \n\nThe Tesla air vents provide ample control via the touchscreen, with some very cool graphics to change the airflow direction, by \u001cpinching\u001d the air animation.\n\n[Climate Control](https://preview.redd.it/0fyaaubws4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9255b483b56f58f2e92e833d541d71d54481f2ab)\n\nThe steering wheel comes with scrolling wheels that serve multiple purposes, for example controlling the music volume/track, cruise speed, side mirrors, steering column tilt, and soft/hard rebooting the car. It also has a built in sensor to detect whether your hands are on the steering wheel during FSD (see below).\n\n[Steering Wheel Controls](https://preview.redd.it/93vo5v5ys4y51.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a77fd63f0388336f43961e6250ce6d83f01f6099)\n\nOf course, you get all of the above&.under a wondrous, panoramic, tinted glass roof that inspires you to daydream in the daytime and stargaze at night.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Glass Roof](https://preview.redd.it/kiytvua1t4y51.png?width=4160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97c0db691401679f5e24d9552d46aa5e19cd092)\n\n# 4. Driving\n\nThe Model 3 is extremely quiet, fun to drive, nimble on turns, and accelerates fast enough to make people\u0019s heartthrob and say \u001cwow!\u001d \n\nImagine having the acceleration of an expensive sports car with the feel of a golf cart \u0014 that\u0019s what driving a Tesla feels like.\n\nAs of November 2020, here were the 0 to 60 MPH speeds for the three Tesla 3 models (with the ability to go faster via a paid upgrade):\n\n* Standard Range Plus: 5.3s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 140 MPH\n* Long Range AWD (my car): 4.2s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 145 MPH\n* Performance: 3.1s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 162 MPH\n\nTo begin driving a Tesla 3, you turn it on by putting your foot on the brake pedal and turn it off by putting the car in park \u0014 there\u0019s no \u001ccranking\u001d the car on or shifting the gear in park and pressing a STOP button \u0014 it\u0019s essentially like turning your smartphone on and off. \n\nSometimes at a complete stop in my garage or parking spot, I\u0019ll forget to put my car in park before opening the door \u0014 but no worries, the car automatically puts it in park for you.\n\nTesla also automatically engages the emergency brakes, when you park your car. It\u0019s these little conveniences that Tesla has thought of, which make the Tesla so much fun to own.\n\nWhile parking/reversing (e.g. in a tight garage), it helps to see a readout of exact measurement, and audio/visual warnings, for objects close by.\n\n[Tesla Nearby Objects Warning and Backup Camera](https://preview.redd.it/6ozx7sc4t4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8807f4fb65da59769779bcacdceb91b78172691b)\n\nWhen you first use the accelerator pedal on a Tesla 3, it feels like you\u0019re pressing against pure air since it\u0019s so quiet but the highly responsive, induction motor makes it a lot of fun to go from 0 to 60 MPH (4.4s in my car)!\n\nI absolutely love how quiet my Tesla drives. EVs in general are very quiet under 30 MPH, in fact so quiet that many countries will soon require sound emitters in EVs, for pedestrian and bicyclist safety. \n\nThough the Tesla 3 is a sedan, the large battery in the center gives it the weight and low center of gravity, making it more nimble than many sports cars I\u0019ve owned before.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Battery](https://preview.redd.it/mzsrvau7t4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ce892b463b8bbc84419c0bcf6e48828c6ec937)\n\n**Single Pedal Driving**\n\nOne of the coolest features of the Tesla is \u001csingle pedal driving\u001d using a technology called Regenerative Braking (Regen for short; [see Wikipedia for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake)). \n\nWhen you let go of the accelerator, Regen enables your car to slow down rapidly while also charging your battery. My brake usage has reduced by 80% compared to conventional cars.  For example, you can have the car slow down quickly for turns or gradually come to a complete halt at stop signs, without having to use the brakes. \n\nTesla provides an automatic brake HOLD function that enables your car to stay at a complete stop, without you having to keep your foot on the brake (e.g. at a red light). This HOLD feature also automatically engages, when the car slows down to 0 MPH.\n\nThe HOLD function complements regenerative braking, since you can let go of the accelerator while approaching a red light and have the car come to a complete stop, without having to use the brake pedal (i.e. single pedal driving).\n\n**FSD/Autopilot**\n\nIf you\u0019ve seen the 2004 movie \u001cI, Robot\u001d starring Will Smith (as Detective Del Spooner), there\u0019s a scene after he crashes a car, when his lieutenant yells this at him: \u001cWhat is the matter with you? Traffic Ops tells me you\u0019re driving your car **manually**.\u001d\n\nWe are as close to fully autonomous cars, as we've ever been in our lifetime.\n\nThere are [five levels to autonomous vehicles](https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/):\n\n1. Driver Assistance\n2. Partial Automation\n3. Conditional Automation\n4. High Automation\n5. Full Automation\n\nTesla currently has Level 2 in its cars but has already demonstrated Level 3, in this [popular two-minute YouTube video by Tesla](https://youtu.be/tlThdr3O5Qo).\n\nHowever, even just Level 2 FSD is one of the coolest features in the car, since it significantly reduces the driver fatigue. \n\n[FSD - Highway \\(Utah\\), Night \\(Tahoe\\) and Golden Gate Bridge \\(San Francisco\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fy654bhat4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7e6e4692eb4e40f2f5af483f80200bc83a1172)\n\nFSD is a suite of features including Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, and others (e.g. Autopark, Traffic and Stop Sign Control).\n\nFSD literally saves you so much driving that, at times, you feel like you\u0019re babysitting the car, by just leaving one hand on the steering wheel with your feet lounging.\n\nI tell friends driving with FSD feels like playing a video game in a comfortable lounge chair, where you have to pay enough attention to not die but you\u0019re enjoying every minute of it. \n\nI use FSD anywhere and everywhere there are visible lane markings, from 25 MPH street to 80 MPH highway, speed zones.\n\nThis technology keeps getting better with every software update \u0014 I\u0019ve literally seen how it handles so much better over the past year, around things like construction areas.\n\nYou can engage just Autopilot (Traffic-Aware Cruise Control) by pressing the cruise control lever fully down once. To engage the full FSD, you press the lever down twice \u0014 this activates Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, and Auto Lane Change.\n\nLet\u0019s take a closer look at how FSD works.\n\n[According to Tesla\u0019s website](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot), \u001cEight surround cameras provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.\u001d\n\n[FSD - Cameras, Auto Lane Change](https://preview.redd.it/s28sotkgt4y51.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e20f98c616f548049083bedb176d0f050a669145)\n\nThe Auto Lane Change feature is amazing and I absolutely love using it each time! You change lanes by simply giving the turn signal and let your car do the rest; i.e. the car will automatically change lanes, when it\u0019s safe. \n\nWhile doing my cross-country road trip, I came up with two supplemental terms to *Auto Lane Change:*\n\n* *Delayed Auto Lane Change:* When you know you can\u0019t change lanes due to traffic, you can go ahead and \u001cqueue\u001d your lane change request and the Model 3 will change lanes, when safe. \n* *Accelerated Auto Lane Change*: When you don\u0019t want to wait, so you speed up to create a safe distance between the cars, which triggers Tesla to change lanes.\n\nFSD requires you to have your hands on the steering wheel every 20-30 seconds \u0014 I rest my left or right hand on the bottom part of the steering wheel to avoid getting the warnings but I\u0019ve heard of people using their legs, water bottles and other crazy ways to fool Tesla\u0019s FSD into thinking your hands are on the wheel.\n\nI\u0019m a bit embarrassed to be boastful about this but I\u0019ve come to rely so much on FSD that depending on surrounding traffic, I\u0019ll work on my mobile device momentarily (e.g. editing documents, instant messages, quick web browsing). I feel irresponsible and guilty but part of me thinks, this is how we\u0019ll gradually move to FSD&a couple of seconds at a time.\n\nWhile I absolutely LOVE FSD and use it for 80% of my driving (highway, local), I can\u0019t see a door-to-door FSD till 2022 or later, due to factors including Tesla\u0019s technology, roads (e.g. lane marketings) and legislation.\n\nTesla\u0019s FSD technology is already phenomenal and getting better rapidly but it has quirks that still gives me (and my family) a scare every now and then \u0014 enough for me to pay attention to the road.\n\nYou can learn more about Tesla\u0019s FSD technology here: [tesla.com/autopilotAI](https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI).\n\n# 5. Charging\n\nOne of the things people worry about with fully electric cars is running out of charge \u0014 after two years of ownership and a cross-country road trip, I can assure you, this has rarely been a problem for me.\n\nMany of my friends can\u0019t believe I still charge on 120v, after 2 years of owning my car! I realize it\u0019s extremely inefficient but we were considering moving and I just haven\u0019t felt the need for it since I work from home. \n\n120v (Level 1) charges at a pathetic 5 MPH but you can get 50+ miles overnight. 240v (Level 2) chargers charge between 10-50 MPH and direct current faster chargers (Level 3) such as the Tesla\u0019s superchargers, can charge from a couple hundred to 1,000 MPH (using the new [V3 Supercharging](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Supercharger Network and Three Levels of Charging \\(source: pluglesspower.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bctg6tlxg5z51.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42a961e8989be5b20b3540caa7b2902cf85496e)\n\n[According to Tesla\u0019s website](https://www.tesla.com/supercharger), as of November 2020, there were 2,000+ Supercharger stations (20,000+ Supercharger outlets) worldwide, with many more coming soon.\n\nOf course, you can always use 3rd party chargers or use the charging cable and adapter that comes with the Tesla. [According to Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416750/number-of-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-outlets-united-states/), there were over 24,000 charging stations (with over 78,000 outlets) in the US, as of September 2020.\n\n# 6. Safety\n\nTesla cars have the honor of receiving some of the highest safety ratings possible, thanks to their driver/passenger protection (e.g. airbags, rollover, alerts).\n\nFor example, here\u0019s a graphic from Tesla\u0019s website, showing all 5-star ratings for a Tesla Model 3, from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\n[Tesla\u0019s NHTSA Rating and Model 3 Airbags](https://preview.redd.it/krygv2tkt4y51.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f82fc7cab13dc3bdfe994f0b8c42f0652c22a0b)\n\nFrom close by objects in your garage to objects on the highway, Tesla 3 has you covered with alerts. \n\nWhile driving, Tesla constantly detects surrounding objects and displays them on the touchscreen (e.g. car, trucks, motorcycles, people, stop lights, lane markings). Any endangering aspects will show up in red (e.g. lane changes, passing cars).\n\n# 7. Maintenance\n\nEVs in general require much less maintenance than internal combustion automobiles. Tesla maintenance comes mostly in the form of software.\n\nTesla updates the software in the car automatically, every month or so. If you\u0019re new to a Tesla, it takes a little getting used to receiving software updates, similar to your smartphone or computer. Till this day, I find it fascinating that Tesla cars are just as much software (or more), as they are hardware.\n\n[Tesla Software Updates and Mobile Service](https://preview.redd.it/6l7bmwtmt4y51.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6072ac5bcf13cb1bf02df394abf47d1768d4f0da)\n\nTesla is also known to roll out some significant improvements via software updates \u0014 something you would expect to take your car in for (e.g. an acceleration boost from 4.4 to 3.9 seconds).\n\nMuch of any hardware maintenance can be done via Tesla\u0019s mobile service, where someone comes out to wherever you want. For example, I just had my two-year service done for $192.05, in my driveway (see [Tesla\u0019s Car Maintenance page](https://www.tesla.com/support/car-maintenance) for details) with the following note in the electronic invoice:\n\n&gt;*\u001cChecked Brake Fluid Brake Fluid at 80% life. Replaced Pair of Wiper Blades. Replaced Cabin Filter. Maintenance Performed Tire Rotation on Passengers side only, Drivers side tires are good where they are right now. Recommend new pass front tire soon.\u001d*\n\nAll other major services can be handled at one of Tesla\u0019s [Service Centers](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States), by scheduling via the mobile app. \n\nIn my area, they tend to be booked 2 to 4 weeks out but the service otherwise is courteous and efficient, handled using a combination of SMS texts, in person and email communications and generous Uber/Lyft credits to get around.\n\nOne thing I\u0019ve found to be a pain is when you have a flat tire \u0014 the 183 tires used on a Tesla 3 can be expensive and hard to find, since they have acoustic foam inside them. This was the #1 concern on my mind, while traveling on my cross-country road trip.\n\n# 8. Community\n\nUnsurprisingly, Tesla has a huge fan base including online social networks, offline clubs, third party apps, and much more. The following are some popular clubs and third-party apps that I\u0019ve come across and/or use regularly.\n\n**Clubs**\n\n1. Reddit: [r/Teslamotors](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/), [r/TeslaModel3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/), [r/TeslaLounge](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/), [r/TeslaCam](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaCam/)\n2. Forums: [Official Tesla Forums](https://forums.tesla.com/), [Tesla Owners Online](https://teslaownersonline.com/), [Tesla Motors Club](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/forums/model-3.137/), [SpeakEV Tesla Model 3](https://www.speakev.com/forums/tesla-model-3/)\n3. News: [Teslarati.com](https://www.teslarati.com/), [Electrek](https://electrek.co/guides/tesla/), [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/tag/tesla/)\n\n**Apps**\n\nBefore my cross-country road trip, I decided to hook up my Tesla account to three northworthy third-party apps that many online EV/Tesla enthusiasts seemed to be recommending:\n\n1. [Teslafi](https://www.teslafi.com/index.php?search=2020-08-14): Logs data for all your drives with amazing detail (e.g. graphs, battery consumption, maps, charging stops).\n2. [A Better Route Planner (ABRP)](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=99b25e8f-60a4-4cb4-90fa-f42b107793f3): Popular app used for more precise planning based on your EVs model.\n3. [Stats](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stats-for-tesla-model-s-x-3/id1191100729): Provides several bells &amp; whistles for Apple mobile devices (iPhone/iPad/Watch); e.g. schedule climate/charging, open doors/trunks via Siri, monitor battery health, and more.\n\nIt was a bit nerve-wracking to give my username and password to these apps but once you have an authentication key from one of them, you can use that for the others.\n\nAdvanced users with coding skills can use the [unofficial Tesla JSON API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) to obtain an authentication key or use [Teslamate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate), a self-hosted data logger with dashboards for driving, charging, efficiency, drain, stats, and much more.\n\nOnce you\u0019re setup with these apps, the amazing data they provide makes the whole process worthwhile, as you can see from some of the screenshots below.\n\n[Third Party Tesla Apps](https://preview.redd.it/mxntxwzot4y51.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9909b7db37d5f70871ba149df19ba75ccee11c)\n\n**Aftermarket**\n\nThere are plenty of aftermarket products for Tesla available on various websites. I\u0019ve only purchased two aftermarket products: a Qi wireless phone charger and a spare tire kit by Modern Spare.\n\n# 9. Cost\n\nAs of November 2020, here were the list prices for the three versions of a Tesla Model 3, in the US:\n\n1. Standard Range Plus: $37,990 (range 263 miles)\n2. Long Range: $46,990 (353 miles)\n3. Performance: $54,990 (315 miles)\n\nFSD costs an extra $10,000.\n\nIf you\u0019re considering buying any kind of EV, you can calculate the cost per mile by dividing its list price by its maximum range. For example, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range at a list price of $46,990 and range of 353 miles costs $133/mile, as shown in the below infographic from [visualcapitalist.com](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind when comparing prices is that Tesla is years ahead of its competition with its innovative technology and supercharger network \u0014 something that\u0019s hard to put an exact value on.\n\n[Cost of EV Ownership \\(source: visualcapitalist.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/iaofinrrt4y51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0999812bc4d6201d3c4033bda45e68f26314fb7)\n\n# 10. Improvements\n\nI\u0019ve owned some nice cars in my lifetime but never have I owned a car that I loved driving so much every single day, as much as I have my Tesla Model 3.\n\nTesla is as close to perfect as a car gets but it can use some tweaks, so here\u0019s a list of flaws and/or wishes:\n\n1. **Alerts:** The on screen blind spot warnings aren\u0019t good enough; most people have come to expect something built into the side mirrors. \n2. **Wipers:** Tesla\u0019s automatic wipers were horrible but since [Tesla launched its \u0018Deep Rain\u0019 neural network](https://electrek.co/2019/10/14/tesla-deep-rain-neural-net-automatic-wipers/), they have improved over the past year but still remain slightly flaky (e.g. turning on a couple of times when it\u0019s not raining).\n3. **Voice:** Support for voice commands is weak and nowhere as robust as Apple Siri or Google Assistant, which can be frustrating since I often have to turn to my iPhone (e.g. calling a local restaurant).\n4. **Lights:** It would be nice to have shortcuts to turn the head/park lights on/off, instead of going into Settings.\n5. **Map:** Tesla\u0019s map is absolutely amazing but it\u0019s missing waypoints, so you end up having to use something like the ABRP app (discussed above). Also, It would be great to see icons for what\u0019s nearby (e.g. restaurants, service stations), similar to supercharger icons. \n6. **FSD:** Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is overcautious, e.g. it\u0019ll keep 3 to 6 cars worth of distance versus the 1 car, I have it set at. Also, given the choice between tracking using the left and right lanes, FSD chooses to hug the right side, which is extremely annoying on highways (e.g. merging from on-ramps). Approaching stopped traffic at a red light on a major road can be nerve-wracking since the car waits too long to begin gracefully slowing down, thereby requiring harsher/faster braking later. The merging on and off ramp with construction barrels, needs improvement.\n7. **Battery:** The remaining battery life isn\u0019t 100% accurate to rely on entirely, since it doesn\u0019t take into account leakage, winter weather, winds, etc. It can be nerve-wracking when you think you have 20%, just to find it\u0019s dropped to 15% (and dropping).\n8. **Apps:** While it was great to be able to hook up third party apps, it would be nice if Tesla officially sanctioned them via some sort of an online marketplace and support for API keys. It would also be cool to add more 3rd party apps support; e.g. Waze, Amazon Prime, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto). Lastly, it takes too long to load the existing apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube).\n9. **Music:**  The music icon should be indicative of the map feature or the music and maps screens need to be separated. The music portion of the screen allows resizing but blocks the directions, in larger view. The music screen should provide more granular controls for track and display the time for songs (e.g. time left/played). There\u0019s no way to pause/mute the radio on the screen (you have to use the wheel on the steering wheel). Lastly, the Spotify interface is flaky (e.g. long load times, checkmark is confusing).\n10. **Tires:** I realize many cars nowadays do not include spare tires but it would be nice if Tesla provided third party options on your website, similar to how Apple/Google have marketplaces with reviews, for third party products (e.g. Spare Tire Kit by Modern Spare). Of course, Tesla does offer [roadside assistance service](https://www.tesla.com/roadside-assistance).\n11. **Superchargers:** It would be nice to have a tall, physical Tesla sign at supercharging stops, since it can be hard to find charging stations in places like shopping centers. A nice trick is to zoom in the destination using the satellite view of the map.\n12. **Service:** It can take from a couple to a few weeks to get a service appointment. I suspect some of the backlog is due to the [issues earlier models had](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/). I had one major and a couple of minor issues early on (steering wheel replacement, door hinges), which were covered under factory warranty and addressed quickly by Tesla.\n13. **Miscellaneous:** Having to reboot occasionally and/or rare black screen. Inside door opening controls can be confusing for first timers, since they look like window controls. Better/adjustable seat headrest that don't stick out so much. Rear windshield wipers to avoid water build up.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs detailed as this review is, I haven\u0019t covered many features, for example Navigate on Autopilot, Autopark, Lane Assist, chime on green traffic light, automatic high beam, driver profiles, and so much more.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla continuously delivers features, so it\u0019s not feasible to list everything here. For example, the beta version of the completely rewritten FSD [began rolling out in October 2020](https://electrek.co/2020/10/20/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-rollout-elon-musk-slow-cautious/). For more information on software updates and other great resources, visit [tesla.com/support](https://www.tesla.com/support).\n\nIn my opinion, Tesla is years ahead of anything comparable on the market currently, thanks to their technology, customer data, supercharger network, battery life, customer service, and more.\n\nTesla has reinvented the car and thought of so many conveniences (e.g. single pedal driving, auto unlock/lock doors, low maintenance), that it makes it a pleasure to drive and own this car, every single day. Even long distance driving feels more like an enjoyable journey rather than a chore. \n\nIf you\u0019re considering buying a Tesla 3, do it. Imagine driving the car of the future, today!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thanks for reading! :)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*If you still want more...please see the* [*original post*](https://startupsidekick.com/the-definitive-tesla-model-3-review-own-the-future-today/) *for video reviews, more photos and...a* [*work anywhere journey on this road trip*](https://startupsidekick.com/roadtrip/)*.*",

If I had to replace it, I'm confident that I would buy another Model 3.\n\nA big reason for that is the reliability of the supercharger network. Once Tesla opens that up to non-Teslas, I think the competition becomes a lot more compelling. I'd probably still opt for a Tesla because of their commitment to the software. It's not just that software updates can bring new features, but they fix bugs too. I'm tired of selling my car with the same buggy software it had when I bought it.\n\nThe only thing I'd *really* like to see changed on the car is the addition of a heads up display. Even if all it does is display the current speed. While I've gotten used to checking the display, I still don't like it. And  with Tesla's development team, I'm sure they could come up with some unique features for a HUD.\n\nThe other big complaints about Teslas are non-issues for me. I didn't have any fit and finish issues when I took delivery. And while I have experienced phantom braking, it's a rare occurrence. When it happens I immediately apply my foot to the accelerator pedal and snap the car out of it. Other than my HUD complaint, I don't mind everything being on the screen.\n\nA Tesla is not for everyone. You might want something more luxurious. Or something with physical buttons for climate control. But every vehicle has to make trade offs. And I think the engineers at Tesla built an outstanding daily driver.",

      "title": "FYI on Post Accident Learnings",
      "text": "I have sure learned a lot about Tesla, and more importantly, I've discovered what I didn't know after an accident in a Tesla. \n\nI was recently in an accident in my Model 3. The car wasn't drivable. I jumped onto the Tesla app, navigated to Roadside Assistance, and selected \"Accident\" and \"Non-Drivable\". Tesla promptly texted me with a tow company and an estimate to have the vehicle transported to the nearest (120mi) Tesla Service Station in Tulsa. I thought \"this was awesome\"!\n\nThe tow driver showed up, got the vehicle onto the flatbed tow truck and was off.\n\nThe following morning, I was notified by a user on this forum that there are no collision body shops in Tulsa. This was confirmed Monday morning when I received a call from the Tulsa service manager. He recommended that the only authorized Tesla body shop was in Oklahoma City. He said that I in-fact did nothing wrong, but Tesla should have recognized that the car was in an accident and had the vehicle directly towed to the repair facility. \n\nFinally, the car has been at the repair facility for about 30 hours and I was getting anxious about the battery. I opened the Tesla app, and saw the car was actually plugged in at the repair facility! \n\nThe TL;DR is: \n\n1.) Right now - go to [https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support](https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support) and near the bottom there is a search field for finding local authorized body shops. Find the one you would want to take your vehicle to, write it down, and throw it into the glove box of your car.\n\n2.) Tesla Service Centers are NOT collision repair facilities. Per Tesla, there is only 1 Service Center in North America that can perform collision repairs.\n\n3.) IF your car is in a repair facility, make sure that they are actively charging your battery, or make arrangements to bring your charger and have them plug it in. (The caveat here is if the pyro fuse as triggered, it will reduce the voltage from the primary battery and will not charge the 12v)",

      "text": "**Tips and tricks for optimizing the range of the Tesla Model 3**\n\nI recently chatted with a senior Tesla engineer in Canada about some of the tips and trick about how to maximize the range of a Tesla.\n\nIt seems that the battery loves warmth.\n\nIn order to get the best range, the battery needs to be warm. On roadtrips, this is certainly of more value.\n\nThe trick, it seems, is to get the battery warm before you drive it. When you start driving it cold, there is not much regen going on, and consumption is at its maximum. This is particularly an issue on road trips. Solution?\n\n**Charge before you leave.**\n\nImmediately before you leave, make sure that you charge your car\u0019s battery. Schedule charging for about an hour before your departure.  This warms the battery and allows regen to work effectively.\n\nDon\u0019t charge your battery to 80% or 100% the night before a road trip, charge it to 60%, then schedule the departure charging using the app on your phone to depart at a certain time, and have the battery pre-warmed and charged before you leave.\n\nUse the navigation suggestions about recharging at Superchargers and charge for only as long as is suggested. This optimizes both range and travel time.\n\n**Restarting a dead Tesla Model 3:** \n\nTo open and restart the car when the batteries are dead (both the 12V and the High Voltage battery): Open the tow-hook port (front bumper) and recover the two electric leads. Connect each end to the terminals of a 9V battery, and the Frunk will pop open, allowing you access to the 12 V battery.\n\n**Contact Navigation**\n\nYou can connect your phone to your address book, by selecting a contact in your address book, and sharing his or her location to the Tesla app.\n\nThis will send directions to your contact\u0019s location.",

      "text": "Hey Y'all.  Over 4th of July took a 9 day long trip from LA to Wyoming. This was my first over 400 mile trip so wanted to share some data points for those interested. Round trip was 2700 miles averaging 239wh/mi traveling from CA &gt; Nevada &gt; AZ &gt; Utah &gt; Idaho &gt; Wyoming and back\n\nPlanning: Checked Ventusky for wind directions for any tail winds or head winds, ABRP and Tesla Supercharger map to see if any major elevation gains and charging gaps (especially in Eastern Idaho and Wyoming). My previous car was a Chevy Bolt so I was pretty familiar with driving long distances on pure electric using EA/Chargepoint etc.\n\nCar: We packed a lot due to car camping for a couple of days and tent camping while in Tetons. 2 people slept seats folded down with 3\" mattress topper (we are both under 5'10'') while moving our bags/container boxes to the driver/passenger seats no issues and v comfy.  \n\nActual Trip: The drive itself I used the Tesla Nav and realized how conservative the Nav was for % battery left even when driving 5-10mph over the speed limit (when it was safe to do so). ABRP was a better projection to the actual driving.\n\nTypical traffic leaving LA on a Friday evening but as soon as we got into the Mojave Desert we did not encounter any traffic until we returned back to LA the next week LOL! Autopilot was huge for those long straight stretches of road in I-15 allowing us to relax our arms/shoulders and eyes.  \n\nCharging: Each stop we went we targeted 15% SOC which we beat with no range anxiety at any point. Southern to Mid Utah along I-15 before Salt Lake City needs to step up their charging speeds as the 72kw stations (often times charging at 50ishkw) takes too long even for a bathroom break considering that speed limits are 80mph. Jackson Hole Wyoming has a charger at the Whole Foods parking lot which was huge as it allowed us to have enough battery while at the Tetons driving around.  \n\nTakeaways: The battery efficiency of the M3LR is insane.  Any long driving of 250wh/mi or under is great to me. Even driving 75-85mph we were still averaging ~239wh/mi (4.15mi/kwh) which is insane to me due to the speed we were driving, all the added weight from our gear and elevation gains. Coming from a Bolt, I'd be lucky to average 260wh/mi on a long drive. \n\nFun note: At the campgrounds and parking lots at Tetons, numerous people were amazed M3 made it on the trip and asked questions about charging and general electric vehicle questions which I was so happy to discuss.  Many people were from Texas and drove trucks and were legit considering an electric car soon but their biggest concerns was charging infrastructure which is a valid criticism.",

Living in an apartment complex without EV chargers means I rely entirely on superchargers and the ChargePoint network. Fortunately, I'm only 10 minutes away from a supercharger, and my gym provides access to a ChargePoint station. Regrettably, charging at my workplace isn't an option.\n\nWhile charging has become a regular part of my routine, it hasn't been a significant inconvenience. I'm either at the gym or within a short distance of a charging station.\n\nInitially, grappling with range anxiety was a genuine concern. Transitioning from tracking miles to monitoring battery percentage helped alleviate some of that anxiety. I've also learned about phantom draining, the impact of sentry mode on battery life, the role of air conditioning, particularly during high-speed highway driving, and the benefits of regenerative braking. Additionally, I've come to appreciate the widespread availability of superchargers in most cities and popular destinations.\n\nLastly, a piece of advice: Don't worry if your battery level drops a bit after a quick trip. Remember, you bought the car to enjoy it, not to constantly worry about it.\n\nI welcome any suggestions or recommendations for modifications from the members of this community. Thank you for your support.",

Reset the car (wheel buttons, break pedal). Nothing. WTF?\n11. Went back home. Connected my Wall Charger, car is charging. Again, WTF?\n12. So I drove back to the supercharger, car is \\*not\\* charging on any of the stations. Triple WTF\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to call customer service. About 10-15 minutes later, Mobile Service arrived. They verified the problem, and yeah, is not supercharging. First they did a full reset (Turn off the car, wait for two minutes, and try again) with no luck. Then he opened the frunk and went for a full hard reboot/reset on the car. I guess this is something only Tesla service can do.\n\nWhen he car rebooted, everything went back to normal. Car is supercharging and I went on my first long drive with my new car. So if someone has the same problem, calling customer service and a full hard reboot seems to fix it, no need to change parts or leave the car, it seems.",

      "title": "The cost of charging a Tesla",
      "text": "As we all know, charging an electric vehicle is much cheaper than filling a gas vehicle. Especially Gas prices are creeping up again. Oil prices are up 30% since early July. But how much does it cost to charge an EV (I am only analyzing Tesla here)? In fact, it all depends on where you charge. If you choose the right place, you can actually save a lot of money over the course of a year.\n\n**Charging A Tesla At Home**\n\nUnless you have the benefit of free charging \u0014 some early Tesla owners are still eligible for complimentary Supercharger access \u0014 connecting your Tesla to your home charging station is likely the most cost-effective method. In North Dakota, you can charge a Tesla Model 3 RWD from completely empty to a full battery for just $7 at home, although this scenario represents the most economical case. North Dakota boasts the lowest average electricity cost in the country, at less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, and the base Model 3 has a smaller battery than all other Tesla models. In contrast, charging the larger battery of a Model S or Model X with the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. (at $0.34 per kilowatt-hour in Connecticut) would set you back nearly $40.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that comparing the cost of charging an EV with filling up a gasoline tank isn't a straightforward apples-to-apples comparison. To get a meaningful perspective, we must consider how far your budget can take you with each type of vehicle. As demonstrated in the table below, you can operate a Tesla for as little as a few cents per mile. For example, an individual covering the national average of 13,500 miles annually while consistently using their home charging station could incur expenses ranging from $405 to $1,755 for charging.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlp3d1lxwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8223570436f03f1411a2227bc912ee894c300739\n\nThe precise figures you encounter will naturally fluctuate, influenced by factors such as your local electricity rates and your vehicle's actual efficiency in real-world conditions, which can be impacted by variables like weather conditions and your driving habits.\n\nT**he Pricing for Utilizing a Tesla Supercharger**\n\nTesla's extensive network, boasting an impressive 17,000 Superchargers, offers the advantage of convenience, albeit with a price tag. A Supercharger can swiftly charge a Tesla from nearly empty to 80 percent capacity within a mere 15 to 30-minute timeframe. However, it's worth noting that the electricity cost at Superchargers is approximately twice as much as what you'd spend charging your vehicle at home. The pricing spectrum varies, spanning from $0.25 to $0.50 per kilowatt-hour, contingent upon your location.\n\nIf you want to check the price of each charging station, Lectric provides this service for free (an EV all-in-one app), it can help you find the most affordable stations near you. The difference between Lectric and the Tesla platform is that in addition to Supercharger, Lectric also supports price inquiries of other suppliers like EA, Evgo, etc. It also supports price comparison during route planning. You can choose the cheapest or shortest route according to your needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krabdumqwssb1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301d999bfa5a4a543803c6e92e429ce126ec8809\n\nWhile most EV drivers typically utilize these DC fast chargers for long-distance journeys, some Tesla owners rely on Superchargers as their primary charging stations, akin to conventional gas stations. The table provided below presents energy expenses based on prevailing Supercharger rates, with annual energy cost projections calculated under the assumption of covering 13,500 miles annually, relying exclusively on Supercharger charging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk4qdp4vwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c9fe328c1379e3f9b04bb273190deb14cc7ec0\n\nTesla occasionally entices new buyers with complimentary Supercharging, typically offered toward the end of the year or fiscal quarter to stimulate sales. In recent years, these incentives have been restricted to 1,000 miles or a one-year duration. However, there's a noteworthy exception for some Model S and Model X vehicles sold before January 15, 2017, which included a unique perk of free lifetime Supercharging. This benefit seamlessly transfers to each new owner whenever the vehicle changes hands. Consequently, these specific Teslas can be somewhat elusive in the market and often command a premium when they become available for sale. Their added value is typically most pronounced for individuals intending to rely solely on Superchargers, considering the economical nature of home charging.\n\nShould you express interest in a comprehensive comparison between the expenses of Charging a Tesla and Fueling a Gasoline Vehicle, I will provide a detailed update in forthcoming content.",

      "title": "Tesla Model 3 First Impressions after owning for a few days.",
      "text": "TLDR: excellent car with minor issues. Slightly overpriced right now, but glad I went with it.\n\n**Background**: My wife and I have been living with 1 car for the last few years, we both work out of the house and have not needed another car, we have a baby now who has started Montessori so we needed a second car. I did a lot of research and test drives of a ton of different ICE and EVs, everything from the Kia EV6, Hyundai Ioniq 5, polestar 2, Tesla Model Y and 3, Volvo C40, and various ICE SUVs from Lexus, BMW, Audi, and Toyota.\n\nI chose the Model 3 RWD for a few reasons, the main one is I love how it looks, both inside and out, the tech is by far the best experience of any vehicle I tested, and the engineering of the battery and drive components is significantly ahead of any other company. Also, price for performance is unmatched at $47k ($48k for us due to getting the white interior). The Model 3 LR or a Model Y would be nice, but not worth the current price difference of $11k or $19+k. While I can afford any vehicle I looked at; I don\u0019t like feeling that I\u0019ve overpaid for something. I also am not concerned with insane acceleration.\n\nOk, so far the good and the bad and the ugly.\n\n**The good**: This car is beautiful, I swapped the stock hub caps with the \u001cUberturbine\u001d hubcaps from AliExpress and man, it makes it looks soooo much better. They also protect the rim slightly and offer better efficiency over the stock aero covers.\n\nRide quality is good, it\u0019s not a Lexus, but suspension is good and interior cabin noise is on par with most other cars I test drove. One pedal driving is awesome, phone key works flawless, sentry mode is amazing, controls are intuitive and once everything is set up initially, there\u0019s not much I need to touch. Voice recognition is impressively good, even if the results are not always accurate. The cabin feels very open and spacious, compared to the polestar 2 I test drove, it feels soooo much more open, the polestar felt claustrophobic. I got to test auto wipers yesterday with some Florida rain, they worked perfect. The acceleration is great, especially from 25-70 mph. 0-30 mph on the RWD is def lacking compared to the AWD models, but I care more about merging/passing which is done above 30 mph. The paint quality on mine was excellent, I could not find any flaws. I love the interior, the minimalist aspect is very nice and I'm glad I have stalks and a wheel, not the yolk or haptic buttons.\n\n**The Bad:** Fit and finish is def sub-par for a $50k car, while I had no major panel gap issues, both headlights sit slightly above the body, the window trim on both passenger and driver side rear doors was not flush with the car, alignment seems like it's slightly off, there was a stain on the crossbeam above the driver side rear seat, and the panel gap on the left side trunk area was a bit large, but I pulled on it and it fixed it. Auto high beams early this morning were a mess on suburban roads. It kept flashing road signs with no cars around. Finally, Pricing. I think a lot of the issues with this car is simply the pricing of Tesla's in 2022. I would gladly have waited another year to get one, but we need a second car nothing else excited me. With that said, If the Model 3 RWD was $40k, and the Model 3 LR was $45-47k like it was in 2021, I think there would be a lot less complaints as the comparisons would not be with BWM and Mercedes higher end sedans. Same with the Model Y, Love the Model Y but I don't think it's worth $66-70k. In 2023, they were below $50k for the Model Y LR and at that price it makes sense.\n\n**The Ugly:** I've had a mobile connector on order since June 16th, I reached out to them last week asking when my order would ship, for which there is only 1 Email to contact the shop orders department and still have not received a response. I checked again last Friday and my order was randomly cancelled. I then ordered a new one which shipped out on Sunday. I still don't have a refund for the order that randomly cancelled last Friday and the car was delivered without a way to charge it. Thankfully a friend let me borrow his mobile charger until mine arrives, but the insanely long wait time to get a response about an order issue and the lack of coordination to get your charger before your delivery of the vehicle is really pathetic. I don't know any company that takes 5+ business days to respond to a customer order issue.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add one more \"Ugly\". Lack of USS without a viable alternative solution. To me this is crazy that they didn't figure out a solution, or even an attempt at a solution with the camera's BEFORE removing USS. Trying to park in a tight garage without USS is a pain in the ass. I'm sure they will have an update soon, but they should figure that out before making the hardware change.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the car and glad I went with it. I do wish I could have waited a bit longer to find out what they do for 2023 with the tax credit changes and I would have gladly waited to purchase until next summer when HW4 is rumored to launch. But, Very happy with the car so far. We will see how time progresses and if we go with another Tesla to replace my wifes vehicle in the future.",

      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hunky \\(as named by our three-year-old\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cuoulugyukc81.jpg?width=1195&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3152ad4c199cb6466cca2ed422da8865906e8d36)\n\nLong time reader, first time poster. Last year my wife and I decided that we were going to go electric. A bit of background first:\n\nWe\u0019re in Australia and live in a regional centre in New South Wales. Now, there are probably around five model 3\u0019s in the town in which we live (population \\~ 65,000 as of writing), so it was a pretty big deal to us. To put it bluntly, we feel slightly like guinea pigs.\n\nI have had a lot of questions from my family, friends and work colleagues, most of which are along the lines of \u001cWhat happens when it runs out of charge?\u001d (My answer is usually something along the lines of \u001cWhat happens when you run out of petrol?\u001d). I thought I\u0019d sum up a few bits and pieces here for my fellow regional New South Welshmen in case, like me, you are trawling this subreddit in excitement but have a few concerns. I\u0019ll try and skip over the usual hype around acceleration, storage, panel gaps etc.\n\n1.Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries are brilliant. Although we\u0019re just barely in the first chapter of our EV experience, from what I understand (based on the heinous amount of posts on this subreddit regarding LFP batteries), LFP batteries don\u0019t do so well in the cold.\n\nWhere I live:\n\nMean max temp - 31.9 °C (89.42 °F)\n\nMean min temp - 2.8 °C (37.22 °F)\n\nI mean, it\u0019s only been a short while, and we\u0019re in the midst of a warm-ish summer, but so far so good. I plug it in when I get home from work most days and don\u0019t worry about the 80% max charge issue/idiosyncrasy of the previous batteries. One less thing to worry about.\n\n2. Insurance. We upgraded from a 2018 Holden Colorado (diesel ute/pickup) and we\u0019re saving $20 a month on insurance. We\u0019re with NRMA and have full comprehensive. This puzzled me, so when I was on the phone transferring over the insurance from our ICE vehicle to the EV I asked why. The helpful gentleman on the other end of the phone said something along the lines of Tesla being one of the safest car companies, yadayadayada. I wasn\u0019t going to argue. We\u0019re paying $70AUD a month (at agreed value).\n\n3. Maintenance. A lot has been said about this, so I will keep it relevant to regional Aus. Tesla informed me that if I needed assistance with the vehicle for any reason, they\u0019ll send someone from a metropolitan area (or a licensed someone from a regional area) to come and take a gander. Now, I don\u0019t know what this means in a real world scenario (and hopefully I don\u0019t have to find out), but it sounded legitimate enough. The website states: \u001cRoadside Assistance is available 24/7/365 during the first four years, or 80,000 kilometres for cars covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty (more on this in the next point).\u001d Roadside assist policy - [https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/roadside-assistance-policy-en.pdf](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/roadside-assistance-policy-en.pdf)\n\n4. Warranty. The Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty covers your vehicle for 4 years or 80,000 km, whichever comes first. The Model 3 SR+ (now the rear-wheel drive) also has 8 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of Battery capacity over the warranty period. \u001cTesla\u0019s belief that its electric vehicle is fundamentally more reliable than petrol engine vehicles,\u001d and that it is designed to provide owners \u001cpeace of mind\u001d by combining the guarantee with eight years of roadside assistance, which includes flat tyre support.\n\n5. Rebates. Although we\u0019re under a conservative liberal leadership at the moment, the rebates aren\u0019t HORRIBLE. No stamp duty (as a rebate, $2,250) and an EV rebate ($3,000). For that second bad boi of 3k, applications can be made until 25,000 rebates have been claimed so it\u0019s a limited time deal.\n\n6. Charging. Mainly in the wall at home using the included mobile charger (get about 17km per hour) which does us for most things. Will be getting a Gen3 wall charger from Tesla soon, so that\u0019ll be something. The NRMA chargers scattered around regional NSW ([https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/charging-network](https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/charging-network)) are currently free, but will cost $ if you\u0019re not a NRMA roadside assist member sometime in the future. We\u0019ve been on a few road trips and haven\u0019t run into any issues so far. Also, PlugShare. Just get it already.\n\nWe did the classic ceramic coat and tint just to make life easier with cleaning (touch free carwash, then a quick chamois after). We have a three-year-old so have a car/booster seat in the back and that\u0019s all dandy. Honestly, a great family car. A great family car for regional areas just as much as it would be for metropolitan areas. We\u0019re a one-car family and it\u0019s serving us well. Sure, we get a few stares, but who gives a shit.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or clarify things if needed.",

      "text": "Hello all, so my family decided to get a base Model 3 a few weeks ago and we love it.  Thought I'd post overall!\n\nI'd finally convinced my wife we didn't need any new cars for approximately a year as I had a surgery recently I had to pay off (almost a year from now it will be).  So, I'm like let's wait.  Well, her Nissan Rogue had the infamous transmission problem starting to go and instead of wait longer, I was like let's dump it (the CVTs on almost all Nissan's now appear to be a 'when' it fails and not an 'if'.  Nissan/Renault can get bent and should have more lawsuits)\n\nSo, we did the usual let's look at a Toyota.  I still own my Prius C and an older base model workhorse Tacoma.  Well, I guess I'd forgotten how much Toyota prizes their cars.  They had 0 of their electric B4209x49a.  They had a couple used Hybird or plug-in Rav4's.  They wanted $43,000 to start on a USED base model Hybrid Rav4 that was a couple years old and high miles for being under a 2 year old vehicle.  We walked out before they could pull it around to test drive and laughed (literally did this, I don't care to play games anymore).\n\nWent to Ford and tried out the Mustang Mach E.  It's a great car, really, Ford hasn't done half bad.  I DO NOT understand the Mustang name or as a 'brand' now, but whatever.  The car is again totally fine, but absolutely uninspired and frankly boring (which if you're going to call it a Mustang, jeez...). The price is also a bit high.  The only thing I liked is I found a BRIGHT macaroni yellow one and it had a matching roof too (even though we went with Tesla and most Mustangs are glass roofs, this is absolutely not ideal in Phoenix.  A full glass roof is frankly cool, but horrific for 6 months).  I took a look at the F150 Lightning too as they had a grip - the BASE model ones they had they wanted to charge a 10% 'dealer premium' on.  I laughed again as this is asinine and I don't do a bait and switch - a $65,000 truck online suddenly became $72,000 because of a $7,000 dealer premium.  Their rationale was it's a premium truck like a Raptor or whatever an 'in demand'.  I drive by a few times a week, they have the same ones still there, in the same spot.  I guess it's not 'so in demand'.  \n\nWhich lead us to going back to a demo drive at Tesla decided between the Y and 3, and we landed on the 3 due to the awesome pricing and tax credit.  You get the same or more car than the Mach E or ANY Toyota and it's cheaper... before the tax credit.  It's also stupid easy to buy - there's a price, a few options (and these are real options, not bullshit packages like the dealers.  You want 7 seats in the Y, pay for that.  You want a tow hitch, pay for that.  None of this want the moon roof?  Well you also need to buy a premium sound package!)  Order the car on the weekend, picked up Tuesday afternoon and only was a day longer because her trade-in had a snafu on the mileage report we had to clear up with the government.  \n\nWe love the car.  It's fast.  We had my handyman put in a 14-50 plug in the garage (my lord are industrial plugs WAY more and paying for over 70' of 6 gauge romex wire EXPENSIVE).  It charges great.  We've already done a couple day trips that are longer and used superchargers too - it's all so seamless.  Really, Tesla has hit it out of the park.\n\nJust to wrap up - why are the other car makers so horrid still?  They are literally pushing away customers.  Granted, the Tesla was already high up on a list, but Toyota has lost me as a future customer forever.  Also, the Japanese makers seem absolutely petulant about making electric cars - hybirds were great in 2003 but time has marched on.  I can't see myself buying their vehicles as they currently are and Toyota and Honda both have a joke offering of any electrical cars in the near future.  Ford is ahead of most with at least 2 solid models, but they are stuck in the 1960s.  The dealership model has to die and Tesla will make that happen.  \n\nFinal weird thought/question - I know legally car companies have to charge the 'same destination' charge and it has to be a separate line item - but why does Tesla still play this game?  I don't know if legally the MUST charge it - fine, but then make it $1 for each car.  It was slightly annoying to have to add in the extra  $1300 or whatever when doing quick loan estimates.",

      "title": "What to expect at 100k miles",
      "text": "Hey guys. I just crossed over 100k miles! 2018 M3 LR AWD, 19\u001d wheels, acceleration boost. Here\u0019s some info you can expect.\n\nTL,DR: drive in chill mode, don\u0019t give Tesla service your business, road trips are good (even with base autopilot), expect the squeaks, enjoy the fuel savings\n\n1. Depreciation- my car was worth ~$55k when new in 2018, and it is now worth &lt;$20k, nearly 70% depreciation in 6 years\n\n2. Battery- I bought my M3 at 23k miles, and it reported 280 miles as max range. It now reports 267, which is 86% of its original EPA rating of 310\n\n3. Range- I have never gotten more than ~230 miles on a full battery when road tripping. Part of the reason is I don\u0019t need to go that far between charges, another reason is most of the time when road tripping, the weather was cold.\n\n4. Road trips- since my car is pre-heat pump, I genuinely estimate my wh/mi as 340. The car is EPA rated for 242 wh/mi, but due to the cold and the sport rims, when road tripping in the winter, I get that kind of efficiency. This means in the winter I can expect an 80% range estimate at about 150 miles.\n\n5. Charging- I\u0019ve lived in apartments close to free public chargers for the life of the car, so I have paid very little in charging costs. I estimate my effective charge rate as about $0.06/kwh (including supercharging) or about $1300 in 3 years and 77k miles. Do that in a gas car that gets 30mpg and it costs $7,000\n\n6. Charging (contd)- people are very inconsiderate at public chargers. I imagine this isn\u0019t an issue with a home charging setup, but often in apartment living, you battle self-entitled teslas and chevy volts that don\u0019t move their cars away from the free chargers for days at a time. This has forced me to go to super chargers in the past, costing me time and money\n\n7. Car washes- I\u0019ve only ever used touchless, manual spray washes on the car. As a result, I\u0019ve never gotten crazy scratches all through the paint, and I\u0019ve never had condensation in the lights. I clay and polish the paint once per year. When I detail the interior, everything looks brand new.\n\n8. Service- Tesla service is awful. I had my AC go out, which they estimated as a $400 repair. I asked if they could fix a squeak in my back left wheel (it squeaks loudly when I reverse while turning). They quotes me $600 for everything, and I decided to pay because the sound was annoying. They went in, without my permission, and replaced all 4 brake pads, and some calipers, and charged me $1900\u0013and the service was already completed, so I felt like I had no choice but to pay. Looking back, I\u0019ll never make that mistake again and I\u0019ll laugh in their face. They didn\u0019t even fix the issue, and I\u0019ve been dealing with it for the last 30k miles now. For the rest of my ownership, I will be performing my own repairs or finding a 3rd party to do them. Discount tire can handle alignments, tire rotations, and other wheel services, and squeaks and rattles are just a thing. Just get used to them, or else the service center will make things worse by trying to help.\n\n9. Drive- I come from rural Illinois, and when I was there, the AWD performance was excellent. In snow it was great, and going for a sporty drive with lots of 0-60s was so fun. Now I live in the city in Texas, and there are so many people on the road I can\u0019t gallop! Also, I keep the car in chill now 95% of the time\u0014even normal acceleration in standard/sport causes the tires to spin, and wears them down significantly faster. Base autopilot is great too, you don\u0019t need anything more.\n\n10. Insurance- Tesla insurance is very adaptable. I used to drive 25k miles in a year for work, my premium was $210/mo in TX with a 96 safety score. Now I drive &lt;9k miles per year since I work remote and only sometimes commute 40mi round trip to the office, now my premium is $122/mo with a 99 safety score. It\u0019s the lowest price insurance you can find\u0014if a bit annoying for dinging you for driving past 11pm at night.\n\n11. Accessories- I have 4 accessories with my car. \n-Jeda V4 wireless charger for legacy M3 (gives the original M3 the alcantara charger like the 2021+\n-USB A to USB C adapters for rear\n-A small plastic clip on the driver side visor to prevent it from buzzing and making noise\n-Alcantara center console tray to hold my sunglasses, J1772 adapter, and change\n\n12. Noise- I have one of the unfortunate early M3 owners flaws, which is the motor whine issue. Newer cars don\u0019t have this, I believe, but my front motor whines pretty loud when driving. I try to ignore it. Also, when driving on the highway, there\u0019s a whipping sound of the air hitting my driver side mirror- I took it in to service twice for them to fix this, and they did nothing both times. The car creaks when going over curbs and speed bumps. The reversing squeak comes back all the time (the one I had to pay $1900 for that Tesla didn\u0019t fix)\u0014the solution is to go to a manual car wash and blast water into the brake calipers and on the rotors real good. The sound goes away for about 4 weeks. A GOOD noise I hear is the sound system which is amazing.\n\n\nConclusion: If I needed a new car today, I\u0019d think twice about getting a tesla. For the cost of the monthly payment, I\u0019d honestly probably go with an older used Lexus instead\u0014purely because of public charger inconvenience, poor tesla service, and poor tesla quality control. Don\u0019t kid yourself and think Tesla has figured out their quality control\u0014see for yourself that they\u0019re still misaligning doors (ambient lighting issues), their steering wheels are creaking, and there\u0019s condensation under the lights. With an older ICE vehicle, at least you have control over your own service, and for the cost of a $500+ monthly tesla payment, it\u0019d be much easier to own an older car outright in this economy.\n\nI\u0019ll keep the Tesla until it dies. But it\u0019s just a car. And that\u0019s okay. Just lower your expectations.",

      "text": "Unfortunately my 2022 LR model 3 with 21K miles broke down while on vacation 700 miles away from home. \n\n\u001cUnable to charge service is required\u001d\n\n\u001cVehicle may not restart service is required\u001d\n\n\u001cElectrical system is unable to support all features\u001d\n\n\nThis is what came on the screen while I was supercharging the vehicle, afterwards it wouldn\u0019t move and the A/C wouldn\u0019t turn on. Long story short Tesla told me it was the 16 volt battery and they won\u0019t have it in stock for 2 weeks so I need to fly back home. Is this a common issue or will I have to worry about the battery going out every 2 years?\n\nThey told me they can\u0019t ship it back to without it coming out of my pocket. also said I would need to fly back to pick it up but I\u0019m definitely going to fight back on that.\n\nUpdate #1 08-07-23\n\nI got an email saying they ordered a HV battery and will be arriving in 2-3 weeks. I asked for clarification but I\u0019m assuming that\u0019s the high voltage battery and this is worst case scenario. Luckily we are still well into our warranty, (only had the car for about 18 months) Will update when i confirm / will let everyone know what they reimburse. \n\nA lot of people have been asking why I didn\u0019t stay or try to fix it myself. I was on a quick 2 day vacation to the beach, the service center was closed over the weekend and we had to get back home for work so we took a flight out. We also get married in one month so everything is just on a tight time crunch. They claimed they will reimburse for all the expenses but I will be sure to update where I\u0019m at after the car is repaired. From what it seems like they will process everything after the car is repaired.\n\nUpdate #2  08/08/23 \n\nI called Tesla and they confirmed they ordered a high voltage battery and will be down for about 3 weeks. The LV original diagnostic was a virtual one when they didn\u0019t have the vehicle in the SC yet. When the car arrived they confirmed it was the HV battery. \n\nWorking with my local SC back home for a loaner, my insurance told me they won\u0019t cover a rental unless I was involved in a accident. Will update what my local SC says when they open up today.\n\nUpdate #3 08/08/23\n\nThis will likely be the last update until my car is fixed. My local SC told me they don\u0019t have any loaners available. They also mentioned their hands are tied since my vehicle isn\u0019t even at their SC. Apparently it\u0019s a new policy they can\u0019t allow cars to cross state lines / loan a car out to someone who\u0019s car isn\u0019t at that service center. At this point I\u0019m done, no point in raising my blood pressure any higher over this. I\u0019ll update everyone as soon as they say the car is ready / if they will hold their word on reimbursing me for all of my flights and Ubers. Car should be ready around August 28th.\n\nUpdate #4 12/25/23\n\nI\u0019ve had the car back since August 28th and it has been working normal since then. I\u0019ve charged it to 100 percent one time and the range actually read longer than the original range on the older battery. The SC ended up sending me a check for both of the flights to leave / come back to pick the car up. Will be sure to update if I have any issues.",

      "text": "I know many will disagree and downvote me. But I want to share my perspective as an owner of two Model 3\u0019s for the past five years, as well as being a TSLA shareholder.\n\nTesla has a huge surplus of inventory right now, primarily with the Model Y. That has created a unique window where you can buy a Model Y for substantially less than the HIghland Model 3.  The combination of the available $7,500 instant tax credit along with significant inventory discounts make the Model Y a steal right now.\n\nContrast that with the Model 3 where you have to choose between the lackluster RWD model, or pay an extra $8,750 to upgrade to the LR AWD model.  Neither model is eligible for the tax credit and neither one can be purchased from inventory at a discount.  The RWD model is slower, lacks AWD, has shorter range and a lower end audio system.  \n\nA LR MY can be purchased after tax credit for $37,490.  Compare that with the LR M3 at $47,740 and you will pay an extra $10K+ for a smaller car with similar performance and range.  Even more compelling is the Performance Model Y, which can be purchased for $40K.  We don\u0019t know the price of the Model 3 ludicrous but we can assume it will be thousands of dollars above the price of the LR model.  I would guess the spread between MY Performance and M3 Ludicrous will be close to $15K.  And the M3 is the smaller car.  0-60 on the MYP is 3.5 vs 2.9 on M3 Ludicrous.  Both are very fast.\n\nThere is a lot of pent up demand for Highland right now.  It\u0019s a very nice upgrade with a lot of nice touches.  But even with the improvements it cannot justify the price premium over the Model Y.  I predict in six months Highland models will be plentiful and inventory discounts will begin to materialize.  However, unless they change the battery components it will still not qualify for the tax credit.\n\nSo why am I posting this? Because I predict there will be substantial discounts on Highland models once the initial orders are met.  Soon to be followed by a wave of people posting how they can\u0019t believe that Tesla lowered the price so shortly after launch and now they have lost thousands of dollars in equity on their cars.  And then this will be followed by people responding that cars depreciate in value so live with it.  The cycle keeps repeating itself.  But it doesn\u0019t need to.  You can be a well informed buyer and wait until it\u0019s actually a buyers market for the car.  \n\nIt\u0019s clearly a buyer\u0019s market for the Model Y and a seller\u0019s market for the Model 3.  So take advantage of the incredible deals on the MY right now or sit tight and wait for prices to drop on the M3\u0019s.  It will happen.  History has a way of repeating itself with Tesla.  It\u0019s only a matter of time.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI honestly wasn\u0019t expecting so much attention to my post. I appreciate all the feedback and certainly don\u0019t expect everyone to agree with me.  I wanted to follow up on a couple of things that people have brought to my attention.\n\nI should have mentioned that the pricing and tax incentives are specific to the US.  Other countries have different pricing and incentives which could easily change the logic here.\n\nIt was not my intent to suggest that anyone who bought a Highland M3 made a bad decision. My goal was simply to point out to people who are new to the Tesla world that prices of Tesla vehicles can change very fast.  We still hear about how under water people who bought in 2022 were.  But I also believe that you should buy what you want. So if Highland is your preference by all means go for it. There is nothing wrong with paying a premium for something you enjoy.  I just wanted people to have all of the information on the history of Tesla pricing so that they can make the best decision for their needs.\n\nThanks again for the great discussion!",

I've had many dedicated sports cars over the years but currently do not have the luxury of keeping one around purely as a weekend car. \n\nCayennes really have everything you look for in a car, safety, fantastic handling and performance for a big vehicle and exceptional comfort for relaxed driving, plus reasonable economy for what they are.\n\nOriginally I hoped to pick up a GR Corolla as a somewhat economical performance/DD car, unobtanium. Golf R? Unobtanium at sticker, but a really great car, very Porsche-lite. So I expanded my search a bit, I drove the Acura Integra... garbage for the price. An Integra at 28k? Sure maybe, but at 40k? No way. As a primary daily driver, I wasn't looking for a manual, the CVT totally ruins any sporting characteristics of the Acura, the CVT is truly abhorrent.  Subaru WRX? ABSOLUTE shit box, 20ish MPG and it doesn't even handle well, also basically 40k, at least the Integra has a pretty nice interior, my old commuter 2010 Prius had a better interior than the brand new WRX.\n\nOn a whim, after seeing the 10k over sticker at the local VW dealership for the Golf R, I stopped in the Tesla place next door and took the Model 3 out. It was IMMEDIATELY clear this car is so far beyond anything in its price range its an absolute joke. \n\nSteering feel is huge for me personally, and right away I was shocked that it was... pretty damn good! Is it Porsche level? Not quite... but \"not quite Porsche level\" is an insane compliment for most cars. \n\nMy current Cayenne is tuned and fast as hell, its about 3.8 to 60mph. I ended up with a LR AWD which is technically a bit slower, but it doesn't really feel slower. Past 80-90mph? Sure the Cayenne really takes off vs the Model 3 but everyone knows Model 3s are quick, no need to go in depth about that. Concise version, not really a downgrade from a 500+HP twin turbo Porsche, albeit a porky one. \n\nHandling and brakes? The Model 3 LR AWD can't really compete with the total package of adjustable air suspension, Porsche's brilliant adaptive dampers, dynamic chassis control combined with 315 width Pilot Sport tires anchored by absolutely massive brakes. But for the price? Its ACTUALLY a drivers car. It blows away the WRX, Integra (non Type-S), BMWs in its price range etc. \n\nAt its price point you can get an used older last gen Cayman/Boxster/M car, a new Miata or GR86. Those are the only things that have a bit more drivers car cred than the Model 3. Yes, I am ignoring used Corvettes, Camaro 1LTE, Mustangs etc, I know they can be fantastic but... no.  \n\nI didn't touch on the Taycan but they are in a totally different price bracket, even high mileage used examples. The EV tech is behind the Model 3 for the most part, even ignoring charging network, total non-starter for me. I have no doubts a kitted out Taycan is better than the Model 3 but its basically double the price for a used example that MIGHT have the proper options to truly eclipse the Tesla. Pricing out a NEW Taycan that I would by any metric rather have is $120k. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.\n\nLong story short, the Model 3 absolutely shits on ANYTHING in its price bracket, ICE or electric. \n\nNow to the negatives... man... as soon as I clicked accept delivery of the Model 3 I was dropped like a hot potato. The delivery experience was horrible. In fact, it was non existent. The delivery lady pointed across the parking lot, pointed out a Camry and said its over there by that car, you can watch some videos in the car... and then literally almost ran away. I stood there for a bit dumbfounded. At the time of delivery I had spent maybe 20 minutes in a base model test driver car and had no idea how anything worked. \n\nI immediately found a massive gap between the window and B pillar, checked it in to service before even opening the doors after chasing down an employee. A few other doors are quite poorly aligned but I expected this and wasn't bothered. I did not know I had already accepted the car in the app... in my opinion I felt duped by the Tesla app into accepting the car. I should have been more careful. \n\nThe next day I actually drove the car home, the window B pillar gap looked better in the parking lot, I had no reason to expect that hadn't actually repaired the car. \n\nThey didn't repair the car. \n\nPerhaps they pulled the door molding out a bit so the gap wasn't immediately obvious, but definitely did not attempt to fix the issue, or fix and test drive to car to verify it was indeed fixed like the Tesla app stated. \n\nIn fact, they didn't even close out the work order days later so I couldn't make a new service request without a 45min long phone call trying to explain the issue and finally have someone click a button to fix the problem. As of right now, the issue still isn't resolved and the wind noise is unbearable without music playing. I have a mobile appointment upcoming in which I HOPE they will fix the issue. I figured out how to fix it own my own with some googling but I'm not breaking out the wrenchs just yet to fix a brand new car. \n\nAs of writing this, I still have gotten zero replies to any text messaged questions or concerns sent in the Tesla app since taking delivery and it took about 90 painful minutes on the phone to get a service appointment. \n\nTL;DR: Absolutely fantastic hardware and performance that is untouchable at its price point. Terrible experience so far post delivery. I knew what I was I was getting myself into with Tesla, great product, shit company, **the pros definitely outweigh the cons at its price point** but wow... a few tweaks and the ENTIRE experience could truly be next level. \n\nPostscript: I won't be getting rid of a Porsche anytime soon. When I have the freedom, I'll go back to a 911 or a Cayman from my Cayenne. Why? Because the driving enthusiast community experience is built into owning ANY Porsche, from a ratted out ancient 944,  6 year old base model Macan, to a brand new 911 GT3 RS, you can show up to events big and small without prejudice. I'm active in the PCA and nothing can replace a 400 mile day of canyon driving with a bunch of like minded individuals. I haven't searched in depth but haven't found anything like PCA events for Teslas, this is ignoring the fact that big canyon days behind the wheel aren't really as feasible with an EV at this point in time.\n\nAt the end of the day, any Porsche with the proper performance options from Cayenne to Cayman is a more satisfying drivers car, I doubt anyone but the biggest stans would argue that... but its shocking how close Tesla is with the Model 3 relative to its current price point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "I kept track of all my Model 3 costs. Here's the breakdown of all costs for those interested.",
      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI bought my Tesla Model 3 two years ago in Toronto. Since then, I\u0019ve kept track of every dollar I\u0019ve spent on it. Here\u0019s what I\u0019ve spent on the car after 50,000km of driving. I hope this can help anyone who might be on the fence or wondering about how much it costs to drive a Model 3 in Canada.\n\n[I also made a video if that makes it easier to follow.](https://youtu.be/DcMV0wqtitw) \n\n## Cost of the Car\n\nI picked up my car on June 5th, 2018. At that time, there wasn\u0019t much flexibility when it came to options. I could only choose the long-range rear wheel drive option.\n\nHere\u0019s the breakdown of the cost.\n\nBase price of the car was $45,600.00\n\nLong range battery upgrade was $11,900.00\n\nPremium upgrade was $6,600.00\n\nIn terms of options, I went with the Midnight Silver Metallic colour, which cost me $1300 and I purchased Tesla\u0019s enhanced autopilot package for $6600, which included things like summon, lane changes, and lane keeping.\n\nAfter taxes, the car cost me $83,169.35.\n\nBecause I got my car before the provincial election in Ontario, I was able to qualify for the EV rebate, which at the time was $14000 in Ontario. I received that about 6 months after purchasing my car. That brought the total cost of the car down to $69,169.35.\n\nInsurance is kind of high where I live. I used to pay $192/month for the first couple years and a few months ago, my premium went up to $265/month because of a speeding ticket and more claims in my area. Overall, I\u0019ve spent $5,668.00 on insurance so far.\n\n## Charging Costs\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0019ve driven my car almost 50,000km. Most of the mileage comes from my daily commute to work, but I also took quite a bit of road trips.\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0019ve taken 3 trips to NYC from Toronto, 1 to upstate New York, 1 to Montreal, and 1 trip to Saskatoon. In total, I\u0019ve covered about 15000 kilometres on the supercharger network. Tesla bills by the minute and your rate per minute depends on the speed of charging. In total, I spent $407.78 on supercharging across all my trips.\n\nLike most Tesla owners, I charge my car at home. In Ontario, we get a lower electricity rate during off peak hours, so I\u0019ve set my car to only charge during off-peak hours. In total, I\u0019ve spent approximately $593 on home charging.\n\nSo, the total cost of charging for driving almost 50,000 kilometres is about $1001.38.\n\nIn comparison, if I drove a BMW 3 series for the same distance, I\u0019d spend approximately $6000 on gas.\n\n## Repair and Maintenance\n\nIn terms of repairs and maintenance, there hasn\u0019t been much.\n\nI got unlucky during my first month of ownership and cracked my windshield twice while driving on the highway to work. The first time, it was only a chip, which I got fixed for $100 at Speedy Glass. The second time, I got a big crack, so I had to replace my windshield. That cost me a $500 insurance premium.\n\nBecause I live in Canada and we get a decent amount of snow up here, I decided to get winter tires. I opted for the Michelin X-Ice Xi3 Tires, which cost me $1,178.77. I\u0019ve been going to KalTire for seasonal tire replacement, which costs $137 each time as I didn\u0019t buy separate rims for the winter tires. In total, I\u0019ve spent $551.44 on tires changes in 4 seasons.\n\n## Mods and Accessories\n\nI hadn\u0019t made many changes to my Tesla Model 3. I had the car tinted when I got it for $250 dollars. This included the side windows and partial rear window. At the time, most of the shops in my area couldn\u0019t do the full rear window and the ones who could were charging 3 times the price of partial. I got used to the partial window pretty fast.\n\nApart from that, I partially wrapped the front of the car with clear wrap. That cost $650. I should\u0019ve got the entire front wrapped, so if I were to get a new car today, I\u0019d wrap the entire front of the car.\n\nBecause of the wet winters here, I decided to get all season floor mats. I opted for the 3dMaxpider mats after doing a bit of research and the mats cost me $210.17.\n\n## Total Cost\n\nSo, the total cost of the car after the provincial rebate comes to $79,279.11 after 2 years and 4 months of ownership and 50,000km of driving.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you found this helpful, please [consider subscribing here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrP4jrEMokSG_iR6u5C7XTA).

      "text": "Hi everyone. I live in Montreal and I am looking at buying a model 3 (standard range or long range - I\u0019m still undecided). I always keep my vehicles for 12 plus years. My current one is over 15 years old and close to 300k km. Are there any estimates / projections of what a model 3 battery pack replacement will cost in 10 to 12 years from now (if ever I needed a replacement)? Thank you for your help and advice.\n\n*** Update *** thank you for all your comments and advice. I was not expecting so many to respond! I understand that ICE vehicles have their share of expensive repairs (transmissions, engines, exhaust&) My question comes from the fact that i have been driving ICE vehicles for over 30 years and the most expensive repair was a 2500$ transmission (7 years ago). When I see people talking about 17K$ battery replacements (and I understand it\u0019s a small % and most are still under warranty right now) - I find it a bit shocking. My expectation is that the cost of battery replacement over the next 5-10 years should go down as newer technologies become available. I also understand that most batteries may last 15+ years and that I may never need a replacement. My questions was more if you guys have seen any reports talking about battery replacement cost over the next decade or maybe know of companies that are starting to specialize in this type of business. Thanks again.",

      "text": "I'm in Louisiana and was just hit by a major hurricane and was out of power for about 70 hours.  While my city was spared with avoiding serious damage, being out of electricity in the summer heat here is dangerous.  Heat index the past few days was at 100 degrees, and my house's temperature was in the mid 80s at night.\n\nHaving a Tesla was a HUGE benefit.  I charged the battery to 90% before the storm and slept in the car for 2 nights in camp mode.  In the worst of the heat, when my fans running around the house on generator power wasnt enough to keep cool I put me and my 3 dogs in the car and cooled off watching netflix for a bit.  Talk about handy when you spend 3 days just covered in sweat.\n\nOther major bonus - the Tesla supercharger was available so I could charge my car with just a little wait time.  Right now, gasoline is VERY hard to come by and people search for operating gas stations and wait for hours hoping they can find some for their vehicles and to keep powering their generators.  I was able to charge up to full, drive an hour away from areas hit by the hurricane and fill up a couple more gas cans to deliver to people in need.  \n\nIf anyone is near Ida's path and is looking to help, these folks need gasoline the most. Neighbors are sharing gas and generators where possible, but the scarcity of gas is really crazy right now. Water, food and other supplies are also good.",

      "title": "Model 3 LFP Review after 60k miles",
      "text": "Hopefully this post will provide some info/context to anyone considering purchasing an LFP Model 3. I\u0019ll keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI took delivery of my LFP Model 3 on February 21, 2022. I drive a LOT for work, and I chose the Model 3 for the potential gas savings and autopilot. I\u0019ll share my actual savings below as well as degradation and repairs.\n\n**Battery Degradation:**\n\nAs of today, I\u0019ve driven just over 60k miles. I\u0019ve experienced roughly 4% degradation in this time. Brand new, the car showed 272 miles of range. It now shows 261. This has not impacted my daily driving in any way. I charge to 100% every day. Electricity is a flat $0.09/KwH in my area. I live in the south, so winters are moderate.\n\n**Range Anxiety:**\n\nI would comfortably trust this car for \\~190 miles on the highway at highway speeds (80mph) during the summer. During the winter, 140-150 miles. Far less than the advertised range. For me, I don\u0019t mind stopping every 2.5-3 hours to charge. I would normally stop for bathroom breaks and to stretch my legs, so this isn\u0019t a huge deal to me. That being said, if money were no object, I would go with the long range. More for the charging speeds than range. This car is limited to 170KW supercharging, while long range models can charge at 250KW. Faster charging would be nice.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nRepairs are minimal with this car, but I\u0019ve had a few.\n\n1: The most significant issue was a drive unit failure. The car just suddenly failed on me during a road trip - I couldn\u0019t drive the car at all. Thankfully this occurred while parked. I had to get the car towed to the nearest service center (90 miles away). Took Tesla about 3 weeks to fix. They paid for the repair and my rental car during this process. No issues since.\n\n2: I\u0019ve had the seal repaired on both front windows three separate times. I was experiencing significant wind noise, and replacing the window seals has yet to fix the issue completely; it\u0019s \\~ 80% better, but I suspect the front windows are misaligned on the track within the door, causing an imperfect seal when fully rolled up, thus causing wind noise at high speeds. Not an issue for city driving. I\u0019ve decided it\u0019s no longer worth trying to fix and I just deal with it.\n\n3: I\u0019ve replaced tires once in 60k miles, costing roughly $1600. I didn\u0019t rotate tires properly during this period causing my back tires to wear rapidly. Tesla recommends rotating tires every 6000 miles or so.\n\n4: I had the back glass replaced due to a rock cracking it. \\~$800 repair.\n\n5: not technically a repair, but it cost me $1300 to have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet at my house. My mobile connector was included with the car at the time of purchase, but Tesla no longer includes these for free. This will add \\~$250 to your charging installation cost.\n\nNow onto savings. My previous vehicle was a 2014 Ford Fusion Energi (plug in hybrid) which got around 40mpg when running in hybrid mode. Over the last year according to the Tesla app, based on gas prices in my area and my previous car\u0019s MPG, I\u0019ve saved around $2200. Not quite the savings I was looking for, but if you\u0019re switching from a less fuel efficient vehicle your savings would be better. Gas is roughly $3.20 in my area as of Sept 18th 2023.\n\n**Things to consider when purchasing:**\n\nI live in a small town, and none of my local tire shops will accept any Teslas for tire rotations. The nearest Tesla service center is two hours away. This won\u0019t be an issue for me 99% of the time, but for any repairs larger than a tire rotation, I would have to drive two hours to have my car worked on. Thankfully, Tesla mobile service alleviates most issues. I can have my tires rotated for around $70 with mobile service. (Yes I will be doing this myself in the future, I\u0019ve since purchased the required tools)\n\nTLDR; After 60k miles, I\u0019ve experienced 4% degradation in my Model 3 LFP. 272mi -&gt; 261mi. I charge to 100% every day. I\u0019ve experienced range anxiety one time in 60k miles, but I drive an abnormal amount. Repairs have been minimal. Best car I\u0019ve ever owned, but if I could do it again I\u0019d get the long range for faster charging speeds.",

The hundreds of reactions were almost universal:  \"That's why I'll never buy an electric car\" and \"I can fill my tank in five minutes\". There was no prominent mention of superchargers and no explanation that level 2 is slow charging and most often used at home where six hours is not an issue. \n\nI wondered if this was intentional disinformation regarding electric vehicles and Teslas or just one dumb asshole.",

      "text": "Back in 2017 I wanted an affordable way to go all-electric.  So I decided to go with the refreshed Nissan Leaf 40 KWh.  I assumed that Nissan (having made the Leaf for years) knew what they were doing with electric cars.  I was badly mistaken.  The car was perfect for around the city trips.  It still is the quietest car I've ever driven.  But an overheating battery, poor efficiency, and unreliable dealership chargers (my sole method for road tripping) just made for a super miserable experience.\n\nI took what I learned from the Leaf, cut my losses, and decided that what I needed was a good charging network, a liquid cooled battery, and a CCS plug.  Enter the Chevy Bolt.  I heard about this new network called Electrify America and their plan to cover the United States and thought THIS was a good affordable car option.  And it would have worked perfectly, except there were still 2 issues that made some trips a bit of a drag... max 50 KW charging and Electrify America's truly awful reliability in the early days.  The reliability still is pretty bad with Electrify America but it is getting better.  Anything is better than how they were!\n\nThen in 2020, the Chevy Bolt battery recall hit.  At first I got extremely frustrated at all of the issues I'd had up to that point, plus this.  But I turned this issue into an opportunity to get rid of the Bolt with a buy-back and get into a Tesla.  I got the Bolt bought back at almost the full purchase price and then used that to buy a 2021 Model 3 SR+.  I'm extremely happy with the Model 3 and I'm blown away with the ease of charging!\n\nSo I hope you enjoyed my story of mistakes and suffering!  I wish every EV was like this, because this is how it should be.  And I hope y'all can appreciate just how good the Tesla hardware really is!\n\nOh and, because I feel the comments coming, I really wanted to own an affordable, non-luxury, hatchback.  I have a big dog and we go on adventures constantly, so a cheap hatchback I can tear up is still preferable... but I guess I can make the Tesla work :)",

      "text": "I own a 2020 Model 3 Long Range Performance and last month I experienced my first technical issue. What I found extremely anxiety inducing is Tesla pushes you to schedule a service appointment. To make matters worse, the issue I was experiencing was not explained. The notifications basically stated that my speed limits were reduced (to either 46 mph or 63 mph), that exiting and re-entering the vehicle *may* restore functionality and that it was ok to drive.\n\nThrough the Tesla app the earliest appointment I could reserve was 3 weeks out, but during that time the issue never came up again, so I cancelled the appointment. What drove me to cancel was also the $300 charge for a general service diagnostic that I was being told was mandatory. I've worked on cars my entire life and the only time I've ever needed a diagnostic performed was when I had a Mitsubishi Eclipse no start with no check engine code. That was over 20 years ago. My Tesla is leaps and bound smarter than that Eclipse so it shouldn't need a diagnostic, the car should tell them what needs to have done.\n\nOf course, the day after I cancelled the appointment the issue happened again and again. Twice it happened twice during the same trip. Trying to find a workaround online I found people mentioning there is a \"Service Mode\" that you can access by touching the Model 3 icon on the service screen and then entering \"service\" for the password prompt that pops up.\n\nService Mode blew my mind. Through it I was able to see that low battery coolant is the cause of the issue. The only posts I could find were about people taking their car to the repair center and them not having to pay much because they were covered under warranty. A couple said they weren't told what the issue was, and few said that the issue was fixed after Tesla replaced their \"super bottle\" which I learned later was Tesla's term for the coolant reservoir.\n\nFeeling helpless, not knowing that I could fix the issue, I set another appointment with the repair center. This time it was only two weeks out and this time the app recognized the low coolant reason and allowed me to choose it for the reason of the appointment. The estimate was only for a thermal coolant diagnostic, and it was only $24. I can live with that, but the Friday before the appointment I get a call from Tesla and it was from the person at the repair shop. He just wanted to confirm my appointment and let me know I wasn't going to have a loaner, nor would they be reimbursing $100 towards taking an Uber. The next day a notification came from Tesla regarding my repair appointment. The general diagnostic charges were added again making this appointment more than the last one. This time I had someone I can communicate to, but only through the app messenger.\n\nI questioned why an additional diagnostic fee was added and why did they need to do two tests. I was told it was necessary. I sent him screenshots of the service mode, but he said it was still necessary. I asked what happens when they discover the issue was manufacturer related, do I get reimbursed? The coolant isn't something I can maintain. He said that my Basic Warranty expired, and I am responsible for repairs. I said I just want more coolant added then. He said that can't be done. They need to discover why my coolant is low.\n\nThe night before the morning of my repair shop adventure I made one last effort to find a solution and by an act of God I found a blog where the Tesla owner posted that they fixed the issue I was experiencing by going to Napa Auto Parts and purchasing the battery coolant from them. He gave a [link ](https://www.napaonline.com/en/p/ZRX861583)in his post. I figured if this was the case then there should be instructions on how to do this yourself. That's when I found [https://service.tesla.com/en-US/](https://service.tesla.com/en-US/)\n\nThis site is not referenced in the Tesla app or on the Tesla website that you can login to see information about your car. The manuals on this official site are better than any Chilton's manual ever was. Also, the Service Mode that people made seem like a secret is explained how to use it on this site. They even tell you how to access it and what the password is.\n\nHope this helps whoever reads this. Thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I needed to get it off my chest and hope this helps the Tesla community.\n\nP.S. I refilled the coolant, which cost me $20 and have checked on the fluid levels daily, they haven't dropped at all. Best of all, I haven't been in limp mode, nor has the code come back. Oh, and I ran thermal tests and even purged the cooling system by using Service Mode as well. Enjoy the mode DIYers, it's amazing.",

      "text": "Hi guys, owner of a 2023 M3RWD here,\n\nI don't think this is as well known as it should be, but there are four disabled speakers in your M3 base models, 2 in each A pillar and 2 other surround speakers.\n\nI think there's been some posts about a Hansshow audio harness that they used to offer but as of 12/06/2023 has been taken off their website that goes for $59-85 that would enable such speakers with the tools included in the purchase. Seeing a few of the comments realizing that they ship from China, I thought to check Aliexpress for the exact same product now writing Hansshow as a dropshipper. Alas, the exact audio harness appeared on AliExpress for around the $30 price range.\n\nI was initially worried that noone has vetted this specific harness, and I might be wasting my time with a harness that doesn't actually fit my car, however, after one cut on my index finger, hour and a half of crawling upside down in my car meticulously pulling panel pieces off as gentle as I could. I eventually installed the harness, put my car back together, and the sound is extremely noticeable.\n\n**Sound before**: I was able to tell that the sound was coming from the bottom left of my vision (on the A pillar), weak bass response.\n\n**Sound After**: The sound surrounds from the entire windshield and the bass response now violently vibrates my drivers door as I rest my arm.\n\nI did all of this from utilizing one YouTube video (for my 2023 M3RWD):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK-M4I3B41Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK-M4I3B41Y&amp;t=647s)\n\nWith the harness I bought from this link:\n\n[https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805953967009.html](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805953967009.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.21ef18023pcf99&amp;gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)\n\nProof that I 'tore' apart my car:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/njWtLJzz](https://postimg.cc/njWtLJzz)\n\nRemember to disconnect the LV battery before starting to unplug any other cables y'all!\n\nI will be keeping my post open to answer any questions or concerns you guys may have. But for $30, this upgrade is a no-brainer and reduces the difference between your base model vs the LR by one difference. I also managed to not break any panels nor plastic screws so yay! This installation really wasn't that hard, I'd say this is on the same level as changing the oil in a Toyota in terms of difficulty.  \n\n\nEdit: As someone pointed out, disconnecting the HV battery may brick your Tesla, and isn't required! \n\nEdit 2, Electric Boogaloo: I found that the navigation voice is still very audible and understandable. It\u0019s not muffled as some other reports state and I am at the most up to date software version.\n\nEdit 3: I guess I have to clarify the \u001cextra bass\u001d that I have observed. The harness enables 2 tweeters at the window level door right at the base of the A pillar and the two midrange speakers at the top of the A pillar. I have great reason to believe this mid range speaker is responsible for the perceived additional bass response, as I can physically feel the intense vibrations coming from this speaker. You don\u0019t need a subwoofer to add bass! Mid range speakers even with a bandpass filter can asd onto the lower end as low as 150Hz even restricted!",

Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect [5-star safety rating](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa) as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government.\n\nIn addition, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which offers 240 miles of range, a top speed of 140 mph, 0-60 mph acceleration of just 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior.\n\nTo achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only. You can now buy a Tesla in North America via your phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn\u0019t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free. With the highest consumer satisfaction score of any car on the road, we are confident you will want to keep your Model 3.\n\nShifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. The important thing for customers in the United States to understand is that, with online sales, anyone in any state can quickly and easily buy a Tesla.\n\nAt the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you, rather than you coming to us. Moreover, we guarantee service availability anywhere in any countries in which we operate.\n\nWe\u0019re also excited to announce that we\u0019re implementing a number of firmware upgrades for both new and existing customers. These upgrades will increase the range of the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 to 325 miles, increase the top speed of Model 3 Performance to 162 mph, and add an average of approximately 5% peak power to all Model 3 vehicles.\n\nTesla is committed to making not just the best electric cars, but the best cars, period. And our products are the reason we continue to [rank #1 in Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/10-most-satisfying-cars-owner-satisfaction/) and have every single year since Tesla was first eligible to be included in 2013. Both Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are available starting today at [Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA).",

And, as the title says, I'm always going to keep it much more affordable (the main two Tesla apps that have a somewhat similar feature set are $45 or $10/**yr** \\- this is $10/one-time or $1/mon), and *I will continue to work on it to keep adding more features, with 5 updates shipped this month already*.\n\nI made the app free to try for 7 days, and any support it gets will let me work on Bestla more often by taking more time off from my job (software engineer at a search engine you may have heard of).\n\n**Some key features:**\n\n* View vehicle data over time, such as battery degradation, odometer, and temperatures\n* Many ways to use actions (ex. lock the doors, open trunk) without opening an app\n   * \\[Android\\] Google Assistant support, such as \u001cHey Google, open the trunk\u001d, with custom phrases\n   * \\[iOS\\] Siri support, such as \"Siri, open the trunk\", with custom phrases,\n   * \\[iOS\\] Shortcuts support w/ home screen widgets and automation (\"lock the doors when I leave the house\")\n   * App Shortcuts: long press on the home screen icon to perform actions, or press and hold to drag actions to their own home screen icons\n   * \\[Android\\] Quick Settings tiles, for quick access next to other tiles such as WiFi and Bluetooth\n   * \\[Android\\] Persistent notification with customizable actions\n* Schedule actions (ex. warm the car at 8am on weekdays, or lock the doors in 5 minutes)\n* Homelink support\n* More in the full list on the app store\n\n**App privacy**: The app does **not** store any login information. You can log in either with your Tesla account, or your Tesla account refresh token - the app will use the credentials one time to talk to the Tesla servers to get the token so that the app can communicate with the vehicle, and the login information is thrown away. The token is then stored encrypted so the app can continue talking to the vehicle.\n\nIf you're interested in keeping up to date with app updates or feature requests, be sure to check out r/Bestla!",

      "text": "This probably won\u0019t be a popular post but I\u0019ll post it anyways. I have had my M3LR for a little over a week and the car is a fantastic car overall and much better to drive than traditional ICE vehicles. However in my 10 days of ownership I have found there is one huge drawback that I think will slow down the mass transition to electric vehicles and it\u0019s range. I live in Iowa and it\u0019s winter now (anywhere from 10-40 degrees Fahrenheit) so I expected the range to decrease and I\u0019m willing to deal with the decreased range in the winter but I\u0019m not even getting 200 miles from a 90% full battery. I just drove ~65 miles and my battery went from 90% to 56% and I didn\u0019t have heat on for half the drive. If we want the mass transition to EVs as we all do cause we are part of this group, I\u0019d say the battery capacity needs to at least double to convince the average Joe or Jane to buy an EV. The car is great but I wouldn\u0019t recommend the car to anyone that doesn\u0019t want to deal with the drawbacks of the car -- range. It works great for daily driving, leave come back home plug in and wake up to a full car but road-trips are far from ideal compared to an ICE car. Something I\u0019m willing to deal with because I love the car but I don\u0019t see the majority of the population adopting EVs until chargers are more readily available and possibly charge faster. Just a thought and I\u0019d be interested to see if anyone else agrees/disagrees and why.",

      "title": "My 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; AKA whatever the opposite of brevity is. ",
      "text": "Here's my 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; an exercise in word vomit.\n\n**Review context:** Over a decade of driving Audis, a 2019 B9 S5, a 2015 B8.5 S4, and a 2010 B8 A5. The B9 S5 and B8.5 S4 could not have been more different in temperament. The S4, with a 6-speed manual, was an absolute thrill. Pulling to redline was a neck hair standing crescendo of supercharger whine and unadulterated exhaust noise. The B9 S5, with the ZF8 was the polar opposite, a wave of torque that died out above 5k RPMs and an exhaust note that rivalled a belabored wet fart. Don't get me wrong, the B9 was an ultra comfortable highway cruiser, with the capabilities to carve up the twisties, it just really became an appliance to and from work 99% of the time, with 1% side dish of fahrvergnügen. I have a Mk1 Volkswagen to drive for fun, so I didn't really need my daily to be a true driver's experience. The B9 elapsed its warranty, and with the impending prospect of new tires, new brakes, a 50k service, coupled with all the reports of rocker arm failures, I decided it was time to abandon U-boat and apply those funds to something new.\n\n**Ordering Experience / Delivery:** Both the S5 and S4 sort of found me. My Audi sales manager knew my preference for any color as long as it was gray, sport package equipped, late run S cars. He'd often call me when he would have a leftover, typically in the middle of winter, when he couldn't sell a car on summer tires to anyone other than a moron *(me)*. Entire car purchase on both the S5 and S4 took no more than 3 days, and were completely painless. Ordering a Tesla was as far from that process as you can get, granted it was generally what I had expected. I placed my order for the M3P on April 25th after watching the Jason Camissa and Top Gear reviews at 1am. Not being able to \"haggle\" with the dealer, let alone communicate with a human being was strange. The only time I communicated with what I thought was a human *(likely ChatGPT)*, was via Tesla app texts, typically them requesting documents or further ownership info. The estimated delivery date changed no less than 9 times, an Action Park \"Alpine Slide\" of emotions I'd have preferred not to have rode. My trade in estimate expired 3 times, however the trade in value remained the same from 4/24 through my pickup on 7/5, since I did not exceed the allotted 1000 miles. This kept me right-side-up enough to cover T,T,L,A and FMP of the Tesla. Carmax offered me $800 more, but the tax offset made this a pointless endeavor. Delivery was the first time I talked to a human being, a wide eyed late 20 something who clearly consumed entirely too much espresso *(and Elon Koolaid)* before he came to work. At the recommendation of other Tesla owner's I did not sign any final documents, or pay the \"final payment\" until after I inspected the car. I had been expecting the worst during inspection, after reading numerous horror stories on FB and reddit, however the only issue with the vehicle was a scratch on the carbon spoiler, which Tesla will be replacing free of charge at the end of the month.\n\n**Now onto the '24 M3P itself:**\n\n**Exterior / Styling:** I had always had my eye on the pre-Highland M3P, but the lack of differentiation from lower spec models kept me from taking the plunge. I really appreciate the unique front bumper, front splitter, rear diffuser and rear spoiler. I also think the Highland headlights and tail lights look much more refined in their styling. The lack of fog lights is a bummer, but I also felt the same with the lack of fogs on the S5, no biggie. The dimensional comparison between S5 and the M3P are almost identical, albeit the M3P is 2\" taller. I will say, the '24 M3P styling is enough to make me look over my shoulder when I walk away from it. I find the M3P to look aggressive, yet stealth, which is right up my alley. The little features and details do it for me. It's by no means Pininfarina or Giugiaro penned, but I think it has a clean modern aesthetic, especially with the new lights and bumpers.\n\n**Suspension:** Wow. I'm wholly impressed. Where the B9, that also rode on 30 series tires, felt harsh, clamoring over rode imperfections, the M3P feels so well sorted in comfort or sport suspension setting. Someone described hitting a bump in the M3P as \"one and done\" and that could not be more accurate. There is a marked difference between \"comfort and \"sport\", but neither are too far at the end of the spectrum. \"Sport\" definitely increases compression dampening, which influences body roll *(or lack there of)* but remains compliant and comfortable. In comparison, the S5, with dampers set to \"sport\", was liking having shocks filled with portland cement; I used that setting all of 3 times in my 4.5 years of ownership.\n\n**Chassis:** The low center of gravity of the M3P also contributes to the \"on rails\" feeling. Where the S5 window seals would sound like the intro to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\", creaking and groaning entering my driveway, the M3P makes not a peep. This indicates to my Neanderthal brain that the chassis is stiffer, a feat when you consider the entirety of the M3P roof is glass. On one \"bit too enthusiastic\" *(re: entirely too fast)* entry through a concrete paved exit ramp, the coefficients of friction and adhesion were communicated well through the car, the seat, and directly into my clenched *(yet perfectly cooled, more on that later)* derriere.\n\n**Steering:** On my mindless commute, I tend to forget how noncommunicative modern power steering is, however one drive in the Mk1 reminds me the fact that a steering wheel can tell you, in braille, what is is happening at the interface of rubber and road. The M3P and S5 are equally numb; you're feeling so faithless, lost under the surface, you just can't feel it there *(Chester Bennington croons in background)*. Ratio wise, the M3P feels a bit sharper than the S5, especially on turn-in. Turn the wheel, the nose tips in quickly and without drama. Lock to lock, there are less turns in the M3P, but similar resolution and control. In normal driving, the M3P's \"Light\" setting is perfect, for spirited driving \"Medium\" adds just enough preload to keep from being too darty. \"Heavy\" is akin to the the tiller at the helm of Moby Dick's Pequod, entirely too weighty, severely delaying steering inputs. I will likely never use that forearm vein bulging setting, due to the heft, which is pretty incredible when I'm reminded of the fact that the steering rack in the Mk1 has been failing and ejaculating fluid onto my garage floor for the better part of the last 3 years.\n\n**Power:** There is no comparison here. The S4 and S5 were by no means slow cars, I'd even say you could consider them fast when compared to most cars on the road *(F35 catapulted from the deck of a carrier when compared to the Mk1)*. The M3P is otherworldly. Instantaneous torque is an understatement, \"Ohm my f\\*cking god\" is more accurate. Acceleration builds just as quickly as the throttle pedal changes angle. My first time using \"Insane\" mode, which is so aptly named, caught me off guard and strained a muscle in my neck. Passengers have squealed in delight, excitement, and or *(mostly)* fear, gripping the seat base bolsters and door handle to stabilize themselves. I have driven 911 turbos, M3s, M4s, M5 and M8 competitions in anger *(thanks BMW Track Days!),* and while on paper, those cars have similar acceleration times, there is nothing that compares to the rapid torque delivery of an electric performance car. Yellow traffic lights? If you can see it, you can make it before you squeeze the tomato. The M3P is unwavering in pull up to the \\~110 or so miles per hour I've gotten it up to, with no interruptions for gear changes. I have no instrumented documentation, but I fully believe the 2.9 second 0-60 and sub 11 second quarter mile. It is a thrill, even sans a screaming cacophony of internal combustion, however, you are missing the auditory reference point to gauge speed. The acceleration is cocaine level addicting, and I need to keep Randy S. Alpert Esq., my faithful traffic attorney, whom I've previously funded braces for his children's teeth, at the ready on speed dial.\n\n**Interior:** While I dig the minimalist design, I had been having anxiety over a lack of dash cluster since long before delivery, contemplating adding an aftermarket screen to satiate my need for through the steering wheel data. 10 minutes of driving, that need was gone. The speedo at the corner of the main screen is in your periphery and was easy to adjust to. The lack of signal stalks on the other hand took longer to break 25 years of muscle memory to get used to. While the turn signal buttons are easy enough to use with the pad or side of the thumb, I still occasionally find myself reaching for a stalk that isn't there. I won't pontificate on the fact that all controls are through the screen, other than it must be purgatory for anyone aged boomer or above, as you are essentially driving a rolling smart phone. The seats are comfortable, and supportive, but at 6'3\" and 200lbs, I think I am right at the limit of what can fit between the bolsters, which were adjustable on the S5. My brother, a man of oxen-like man, at 5'9\", \\~270, plainly did not fit in the seats and mushed the seat bolsters to my chagrin. With not nearly as many adjustments as the Audi seats, which were awkwardly flat in shape, I was able to easily find a comfortable position in the M3P's contoured and supple seats. The air conditioned seats, which were not available in my Audis, are a welcomed addition to someone that would describe their basal state as diaphoretic. My significant other, whom while wearing a sundress, referred to them as feeling like \"menthol for your labia\" and I cannot stop chortling about that. Fit, finish and materiality is markedly better than the pre-Highland Model 3s I've driven / rode in. I would say I am generally impressed with the interior that is on par with the Audi quality I have become accustomed to. The addition of full acoustic glazing makes it a quiet place to be, though I rarely notice this due to what is underscored in the next section. I will say, I do miss having massaging seats, but I think that's a fair trade for icy angels singing sweet sonnets upon my sweaty taint. The only other cons I can think of are a lack of operable sunroof and a glass roof that allows heat to build in the interior faster than an air fryer can preheat for my late night dino nuggets. Thank the 'Lon for the ability to precondition from my phone.\n\n**Audio:** All 3 of my Audis were equipped with the Bang Olufsen sound system option. They were never impressive, with a lack of bass and a tinny sound that made the money thrown towards that option seem better spent on the aforementioned cocaine addiction. The Tesla in comparison is amazing. Weighty, mirror jiggling, bass, crisp highs; I've yet to find a track that has overextended the speaker cones. Of all the features, the M3 audio system caught me most off guard, I was not expecting such a strong sound system. Thoroughly impressed and soon in need of an audiologist.\n\n**Build Quality:** I guess time will tell here. I can say, the doors close with a satisfying thud akin to the German cars I've owned. Materials feel generally of high quality. The paint finish on the other hand is not of German car quality, with minor, yet noticeable, orange peel when viewed at oblique angles. On my example, panels gaps, while not post-Third Reich tight, are completely acceptable for a car of this price point. However, I can report that on a trip down the drive-thru line at Sonic for cherry limeades, the wheel aero covers make a highly annoying clicking / clacking noise. I will likely remove the covers this weekend. I can also report, the cup holders easily secure 44 fluid ounces of fast food beverage.\n\n**Summary:** All-in-all, I am very satisfied with the M3P. It is a dutiful appliance to get me to work, while still having the power and agility to provide some thrills. In the first 250 miles, I have saved $50 in fuel alone *(thanks free charging at work).* The reviews that led me to take the plunge, in my experience, are completely accurate. If I had to list my biggest complaint, it's the stigma of people thinking I'm an Elon supporter just by driving one. I love the movie \"The Hateful Eight\", does that make me a Harvey Weinstein supporter?\n\nI'll likely edit and add to this, as my fingers and brain fascia have become fatigued, but anyway, thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0imtz7kywbd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f779a4d5db1fd99b2ca22a00c429f88ca12887ca",

So far, my Tesla has no rattles, extraneous noises or electrical gremlins. A couple of my Porsches have had the latter. \n\nIt\u0019s ridiculously fast! I absolutely love the acceleration. I have the steering on the stiffest mode and love that too. Very good feedback. I\u0019ve driven a 911 and this feels comparable and better than my last car, which was a Cayenne. \n\nMy only gripe is the garage door opener, which is now an after market purchase and trip to the service center for installation. On a $60,000 car. That\u0019s ridiculous. \n\nObviously I need to drive it for a while, but I can tell it\u0019s a really great vehicle and an absolute blast to drive. Very happy!",

      "text": "We are excited to celebrate our one year anniversary of taking delivery of the Model 3, LR, AWD with 18\u001d aero wheels.  The car is beyond fun to drive and the car\u0019s feedback loop is continually making the car better.  Over the past year we have given demo rides to numerous friends, family members, co-workers, early adapters in our community and even some who have simply stopped to ask questions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq5ocjetbnf31.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d195b4fe9839bdc64575950d23b1d06d91cece60\n\nPeople often ask us about range anxiety and maintenance costs. To celebrate our experience we offer you our one year summary:\n\nWe took delivery on August 10th, 2018\n\nPut snow tires on at 6,800 miles (we live in a rural area)\n\nRotated snow tires at 13,000 miles\n\nPut summer tires back on 19,700 miles\n\nRotated summer tires at 27,000 miles.  We will replace our summer tires next spring when we take our snow tires off.\n\nFilled windshield washer fluid twice.\n\nChanged cabin air filter at 28,500 miles.  Note this was completed by Tesla\u0019s Mobile Service saving us a six-hour, round trip to our closest service center in Eden Prairie, MN at no extra cost!\n\nWe have washed our Model 3 more over one year\u0019s time than we had all our previous cars put together!\n\nNormally we charge at home at night using a NEMA 14-50 outdoor wall plug that uses off-peak power.  We love waking up to a car that\u0019s charged to meet our daily needs whether that is a 65% charge or 100% charge.  During the last year we have super charged 79 times for a total cost of $449.88. Our average cost per charge was $5.70 and our average super charging time has been 32 minutes.  We also used destination chargers at lodging facilities and two RV parks to charge in remote areas.\n\nDuring our trips, we used \u001cA Better Route Planner\u001d and loaded it into the car\u0019s computer to display on the screen.  We personalized the planning data based upon our current situation (average wh/mi, temperature, wind, road conditions). We set our lower battery arrival level at 20% to cover for unknown elevation changes and weather conditions (temperature, precipitation and wind).  Using their recommendations, we selected superchargers or destination chargers from the Tesla listings.  Most of our miles have been driven on Enhanced Autopilot.  \n\nOur lifetime wh/mile for the year is unknown but we started with TeslaFI on January 1st, 2019.  Since that time TeslaFI has tracked 17,350 miles with a 269 wh/mile average with our average temperature being 55 degrees F.  Over the same time period, our battery has degraded 2.4%  Since January, we have received 8 over the air updates averaging 22 days between each update.  \n\nOne of our most memorable experiences was while we were supercharging at the Flying J Travel Center in Fort Stockton, Texas.  A father came up with his twelve-year old son while we were eating in the Travel Center.  He asked if were were the owners of the Model 3.  It was the first one they\u0019d seen.  The son knew everything about the specs of the Model 3.  They both smiled as we showed them our car.  His son\u0019s knowledge, excitement and pure joy in witnessing an all-electric vehicle gave us hope for the future.\n\nThis photo was taken at Inspiration Point, located 2 miles west of Lanesboro, MN.",

      "text": "**Customer service is always going to be the most important thing to me.** I don't blame Tesla for there being vehicle faults at all. These things happen, and they can happen at any given time to any product. However, Tesla seems to struggle in providing a \\*consistent\\* (key note: consistent) positive experience at the service level. There appears to be some positive experiences, but there appears to be \\*so many\\* poor experiences mixed in there.\n\nMy vehicle broke down on 10/31, and it's a 2022 M3P that I picked up in June. I absolutely love the car, but it was an unexpected fault that left me stranded for a few hours on Halloween. I wasn't really unhappy about that, as I understand that these things happen. I was patient as I waited for roadside service, and I've been patient throughout the repair process. Unfortunately, Tesla replaced the drive unit inverter, and now realize that they need to replace the entire drive unit or need another inverter. It's a little unclear, but they've advised that it could be weeks more before I have my car back. Again though -- that's not something I'll hold against them. If it were any other car, these things could and may happen.\n\nIt seems that I'm one of the lucky ones that got a loaner after 8 days of asking. I say I'm the lucky one because it seems most people don't seem to get one at all. They don't have an ETA right now but said it could be weeks before they have the part that they need. The lack of transparency is of course frustrating. The fact that the loaner, an M3 SR from 2019 was absolutely filthy was a bit frustrating. It was given to me with \\~20 miles on the battery, and it was just grossly unmaintained. The vehicle had caked on dirt, grime, garbage in the back, sand on the seats, and not a single surface had been wiped down (possibly ever, haha). I'm grateful for having a loaner -- I'm just not feeling that it was an appropriate way to provide one. A little extra care to clean the vehicle would've been the right thing to do, and would've shown some respect/understanding for the unfortunate situation.\n\nI really hope that Tesla is doing something to enhance the consistency of their customer service. As other manufacturers begin to produce viable alternatives, it becomes even more crucial for them to do so. Again -- when it's working, I \\*LOVE\\* the car... I've wanted a Tesla for over a decade, and I've defended the vehicle beyond the flaws/shortcomings. Even now as family members driving Toyotas tell me how absurd it is for a 65K vehicle to break down in 4 months, I brush it off... but it's a lot harder to brush off the feeling of under appreciation. Tesla needs to show some respect and appreciation for their customers, or they may not be lifelong customers.\n\nWe all deserve the very best from Tesla. I hope to see an improvement in their service in the future.",

      "text": "I thought I would post about my ownership experience since I have reached 100,000 miles on my 2019 Long Range (dual motor).\n\nI am the 2nd owner and purchased it in May 2021 with 17,060 miles.\n\nCharging costs: $1554\nThis includes supercharging. I am fortunate to have access to a free nema 14-50 plug at my office so I try to charge as much as possible at work. My previous car was a 2018 A6 3.0T and I was spending on average $300 to $375 per month in fuel costs. I would have spent ~$11,000 in just fuel costs on the A6 \n\nEfficiency: lifetime average 272 wh/mi\nI am located in Michigan so this is with cold weather and snow. I run winter tires on the factory aero wheels and 18x9.5 Gram Lights with 265/40 performance tires in the summer. \n\nBattery Degradation: ~11% \nMy current estimated range has been fluctuating from 285 miles to 273 lately. \n\nMaintenance and repairs: \nTires- $1450\nOem tires wore out by 47k miles. My original winters were from my A6 so I got 2 seasons out of those. 265/40 Pilot sport AS4's were just under $1000 and I purchased new pirelli winters $450 (previous year inventory discounted)\n\nGlass- $200 (comprehensive deductible)\nMy roof glass and windshield cracked at different times from road debris.\n\nUnexpected repairs: $60 \nMy horns randomly failed at 85k miles. I found a low mileage set from a 2022 model Y on ebay and swapped them myself. My drivers seat occupancy sensor is bad as well but is unnoticeable other than the alert within service mode.\n\nSuspension/alignments- $958\nFront upper control arms, 2x alignments, 2x rear traction arms, 2x front compliance arms. I replaced the arms myself and front control arms were replaced at a discounted rate at my service center. I am on MPP Sport coilovers so compliance arm and traction arm wear may have been accelerated a little. \n\nOverall I love my 3 and absolutely would purchase another. I regret not buying a performance but in mid 2021 M3P's were still selling for too much. My next vehicle is going to be a 21+ S LR or a highland ludicrous.",

      "text": "Hello everyone\n\nI though I'll share my experience as a TM3LR owner of six months.\n\nI am from Denmark so prices will be in DKK, distances in KM, dates in DD/MM/YYYY format.  \n100 DKK = 13,52 USD  \n100 DKK = 13,45 EUR  \n(rates of 19/08/2022)\n\nStarting with the ordering &amp; delivery\n\nI ordered my MSM LR 18aero on the 14/12, nothing special happened.  \nAt that time ETD window was May 2022.  \nI had the money for the downpayment, so no issues.  \nIt hasn't moved until 04/02.   \nAt that time it became 17/02 - 03/03. I though cool, 3 months earlier.\n\n15/02 - ETD moved to 21/02 - 04/03  \n22/02 - ETD moved to 25/02 - 07/03 - I could schedule delivery so the next day I did, contracts, invoices signed, car registered to my name, licenseplate etc. done.  \n23/02 - ETD moved to 02/03 - 02/03  \n28/02 - Tesla called me that there is some issue with the car and they cannot deliver on 02/03, so i need to reschedule so ETD 04/03  \n03/03 - Tesla called again, that the delivery for tomorrow is not gonna happen, the car cannot connect to mobile network, service is on it, and if i want to I can pick it up tomorrow, but there will be no mobile connection and ranger service will fix it. I said ok, I can hotspot my phone, no biggie.  \nLater that day I got called again, that I cannot take the car, since the mobile connection is needed for the SOS service, so it is considered a safety issue if it doesn't work. ETD 10/30  \n9/03 - ETD moved to 18/3 during the evening so I couldn't call Tesla.  \n10/03 - ETD moved to 11/3 (I don't even remember why...)  \n11/03 - ETD moved to 18/3, I had another MSM LR assigned to my account with 19´´ sport wheels. I called Tesla (Aarhus), they said that the issue with my car for not connecting to LTE is that it has a dead gsm module and they need spare parts, however, they found another MSM LR in another city (Odense), they will switch the wheels to the 18´´, and bring it to my home address so I don't have to go to the service center.  \n12/03 - after discussing the above details, delivery was scheduled to 15/03.  \n15/03 - I got my car. MIC TM3LR MSM 18aero\n\nThis was about the delivery experience. Not the best, but it doesn't really matter in retrospect, I still got my car 3 months earlier than initially expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuality of the car\n\nAt delivery, the car was perfect.  \nNo panelgaps, no scratches, no squeaky anything.  \nToday, after driving a total of 21000kms so far, only a few minor issues came up: the trunk lift motor/damper is moving in a bit of a wobbly way and depending on temperature, it creaks.  \nThe other is the front left suspension which gives out a thumping sound every now and then when I go over a speedbump. Both are going to be checked in two weeks.\n\nApart from these, all is still perfect.\n\nNo fogging of the taillights, no misaligned doors, no squeaking control arm, no sagging of seats. Nothing.  \nPaint has scratches - some are my fault for scrubbing dried seagull droppings too enthusiastically, some are from normal wear.  \nI have some tiny stonechips on the windshield - inevitable... I had one slighlty more concerning chip, but got fixed the next day at carglass - free of charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCost\n\nThe car itself of course is not the cheapest, but I bought it before the price spikes recently, so it was 460000DKK (+20k for the loan interest). As comparison, today with the same conditions it would be 505k +22k interest.\n\nRunning cost is cheap. I have a subscription for unlimited charging for 670DKK a month so charge is almost no cost (using supercharger only on roadtrips outside the nordics), especially when I carpool a colleague of mine, then it is almost 0DKK in a month.\n\nInsurance is a bit more than what I had with my previous car (Skoda Fabia 1,6TDI sportline), but not crazy expensive.\n\nEnvironmental tax is the lowest 600DKK/Year (my skoda was 3600/year)\n\nThat is for the upkeep, and then of course I bought some accessories for a total of 4600DKKThese were: Display swivel, knick ring, spoiler, jackpads, center tray, screen protector, matte black front emblem and tesla letters for the trunk, wheelcap set, black pedals and a intake vent protector.\n\nI pay for the convenience of the premium connectivity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsumption\n\nI keep track of two consumptions - one I call net, which is purely the consupmtion of driving and the gross, which is the total electricity consumed broken down to kilometers driven.Since I have sentry always running, I am also cooling the car whenever it gets warm, gross is ofc. higher.\n\nNet: 151,3 Wh/kmGross: 228,2 Wh/km\n\nSo far, compared to my previous car, I saved on fuel 12000DKK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter these 21000kms drive, I still think this is the best car I've owned. Ride is a bit rough, but that's a price you pay for a heavy EV in this pricerange, and not worse than the Skoda I had.  \nThe seats are comfortable even on long rides.Sound system is amazing.  \nCargo space is plenty, only the opening of the trunk makes it difficult sometimes.  \nI drive a lot on highway and now I couldn't imagine my daily commute without autopilot.   \nI have only the standard, but i can count on one of my hands the occasions of phantom slowings (not breaking, it never slammed on it so far)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand for the end, some pictures of charts and the car itself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There she is, on a roadtrip to Copenhagen](https://preview.redd.it/tqcxtf7hini91.jpg?width=1119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7fd214cc8def439363d1535a3e5dc0b9704533)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla-inspired stats for the total charing](https://preview.redd.it/ln5x4ygjini91.jpg?width=1304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d3de267fb3a19b310d52a83eb9ff3166d608e9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla-inspired stats for the last 31days of charging](https://preview.redd.it/ii9vfl93jni91.jpg?width=1303&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab72e7e422dbcb8cbf24bb85c490ec0b576e8ef0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monthly cost breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0inwmgwjini91.jpg?width=1308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa91dc8eb3feb6b55c0036cbbf3aba69337ae384)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More detailed cost and consumption breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/71snihakini91.jpg?width=1309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3755b16634fc2363cc1bb28bcf7c7c7dfcebd1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some battery degradation estimate](https://preview.redd.it/x0zi4kczkni91.jpg?width=1689&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d1b62fe5984bd26210929dc1964a7bd2a78a78)",

      "text": "I recently traveled back from New York to Los Angeles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, 18\" Aero wheels (which I've named Marvin) after spending a couple months with my mom during the COVID-19 crisis.  I decided to head back home to LA since the restrictions are loosening in NY at the time of departure and my mom is getting along well.  I took minimal breaks and doing no sightseeing as I traverse the country, and figured I'd write up my experience for anyone interested.  I'll have summary statistics at the end with total distance, kWh used, efficiency, and total cost.  I'm happy to answer any questions about my trip!\n\n\ntl;dr: 4 days, 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86\n\n\nNight 0/Day 1 -\n\n\nStony Brook area to Ridgewood.  Stayed the night with family there, and did not charge that night.  I woke up around 8 AM and started out west from there.  My first charging stop was in Allentown, PA.  The drive was overall pleasant, through mostly suburban highways.  Most of the driving was 2 lane, very little traffic and autopilot worked flawlessly.  There was a $1 toll for one of the small bridges on my route.  I didn't calculate the total miles and efficiency, but the Ridgewood to Allentown portion was roughly 100 miles at 253 Wh/mi.\n\n\nAllentown supercharging spot:\n\n- Large strip mall.  There's a number of smaller eateries and a drive through fast food place, including a Jamba Juice that is great for breakfast smoothies.  8 stalls all of 150kW speed, I actually got around 120.  During my roughly 30 minutes there only 1 other car showed up.  Unfortunately, there's no obvious public restroom here.  Overall this stop is very clean and well maintained, but unremarkable.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 3.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility (ease to find from the highway): 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic Views: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal price: $14.31\n\n\nDrive to Somerset:\n\n210.3 miles, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- There were some really beautiful mountains and tunnels on the route from Allentown to Somerset.  The winding PA Turnpike through the Blue Ridge mountains was incredible, and rural PA is super pleasant to drive through.  Unfortunately there was a good bit of construction that brought it down to one lane with a 40 MPH speed limit, but due to light traffic this wasn't much of a problem.  Again, autopilot handled this very well, but I took over during the construction zones out of an abundance of caution.  There was a toll on the PA Turnpike, but I don't know how much it is yet due to bill by mail.\n\n\nSomerset, PA supercharging spot:\n\n- Right next to the highway.  The only eatery in the area is a Wendy's which seems to be the only spot with an accessible restroom; the charging spot is between a Verizon, the Wendy's, a car wash, and what I think is a dance studio?  I'm getting my advertised 120 kW of power, but of the 6 stalls I'm the only car here for the full half hour that I'm charging.  This station is well but not exceptionally maintained and clean, but not particularly great.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal price: $13.52\n\n\nDrive to Cambridge, OH:\n\n154.8mi, 236 Wh/mi\n\n- A very nice scenic drive through the forest of western Pennsylvania, the country (OK, interstate) roads of West Virginia, and eastern Ohio.  As soon as I left Somerset it started raining lightly, so I was slowed a bit by that.  I-70W was closed through Wheeling, WV so there was a small detour onto 470.  Autopilot did have a small issue in a construction zone where the old lane lines were still visible and there were diverging lines on the left, making the car think the lane was turning when it was staying straight.  Again, there was a small toll on the highway, but I don't know how much it was due to bill by mail.\n\nCambridge, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a Sheetz gas station less than a mile off the highway, with a traffic light to help you make the left heading back to the highway.  This serves as the primary eatery and restroom in the area; there is a Denny's next door about a 300 foot walk.  Bathroom is very clean, as is the parking lot.  Also in the strip mall here is a Dollar General which I guess you can pick up something if you need to.  Again, I am the only car here out of 8 stalls, pulling 125kW, but it dropped to 100 kW when about 60% charged.  Overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.64\n\n\nDrive to Cincinnati, OH:\n\n177.6 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- I wasn't sure if I was going to stop at this one or Columbus in between.  As I was driving into Columbus I saw that I would have a rated ~160 miles to get the ~100 miles further to Cincinnati, so I went for it and made it here with about 10% left on the battery.  As I entered Columbus and the scenery shifted from wooded to more open plains, the skies opened up as well with large heavy thunderstorms.  These caused autopilot to become unavailable with the \"Take control immediately\" message popping up.  The heavy rains dropped my efficiency pretty significantly for this leg of the journey so I had to slow down a bit to make it to Cincinnati with enough charge to be comfortable.  This was definitely the most strenuous but most enjoyable leg of the journey so far.  Driving through the rain was beautiful and I really felt in control.\n\nCincinnati, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a meijer supermarket parking lot.  It's about 2 miles off the highway with a number of turns and traffic lights to get to it, and the GPS took me in through the delivery/loading docks.  The spots for this charger are freshly paved in stark contrast with the rest of the lot.  Also in this parking lot is a Target, so there are probably accesible bathrooms.  Best place for food is going to be the meijer supermarket.  No garbage cans anywhere near the chargers.  For the charge itself, there's me and one other car charging in the 10 stalls and I started with pulling 120kW but that dropped throughout my charging session.  This is a fine enough location but a bit difficult to find/out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $7.15\n\n\nDrive to Louisville, KY:\n\n104.2 mi, 262 Wh/mi\n\n- Somehow Cincinnati was the first city that I actually drove through and not just around.  I got a good view of the baseball and football stadiums from the highway, and the roads were very manageable.  On the woodsy highway through Kentucky, I was surprised how many highway patrol cars I saw with their lights off in the shoulder after dusk.  I finally checked in to my hotel around 10PM after a very full day of driving.  My hotel is about 3 miles from the supercharging station and I forgot to track my actual distance and usage for this short bit.\n\nDay 2:\n\nLouisville supercharger:\n\n- Located at a college annex building's parking lot, the associated bakery has been sadly shut down.  The stalls are nice and well kept but I didn't note my actual power draw while there as I walked over to the bakery to find it closed instead.  There are no garbage cans in this lot, and there is a coffee shop in easy walking distance across the street.  The station is right off the highway and it's very easy to get back on.  There was 1 other car there out of the 8 stalls.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: ??/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.94\n\n\nDrive to Bowling Green, KY:\n\n113.5 mi, 271Wh/mi\n\n- Another rainy segment as the skies parted as I exited Louisville and closed again when I entered Bowling Green.  Mostly 3 lane highway, very easily navigable.\n\nBowling Green, KY supercharger:\n\n- Located at another meijer supermarket, this one is off to the side by a large field.  It's about 4 miles off from the highway, making it less accessible for road tripping purposes.  It's a very pleasant suburban drive down to the charger along relatively large county roads.  Other than the meijer, there are no shops or eateries in easy waling distance.  I'm the only car here of the 8 stalls, pulling between 100 and 115kW.  Overall it's a nice spot if a little out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 4/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Dickson, TN (West of Nashville):\n\n102.5 mi, 264Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped for lunch with a cousin in the suburbs.  Very easy pair of segments.  Nice transition into mountainy roads, beautiful scenery and view of the Nashville skyline on the way.\n\nDickson, TN supercharger:\n\n- At a Holiday Inn Express, 2B appears damaged like someone backed into it.  I'm the only car here at the 8 chargers getting 130 kW.  There's a restaurant nearby in walking distance.  No nearby trash can.  Easy to get here from the highway.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Jackson, TN:\n\n94.6mi, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- Nothing special, but very pleasant.  Good wooded road well paved and fast moving.\n\nJackson, TN supercharger:\n\n- By far the nicest supercharging spot that I've been to so far on this trip.  Unfortunately, the spot is a bit awkward to get to from I-40W as the exit takes you one way and you need to take a U-turn on a surface street.  Luckily, that side street goes by a number of drive-throughs and I got my guilty pleasure that's only a southern thing - Cookout.  Had I not, I would have gotten to eat at the general store, a traditional bakery and had time to explore a small gift shop and train museum, or even play a round of mini-golf (were it not closed due to the pandemic).  There was a classic Pullman car directly in front of the chargers and this was a really cool atmosphere.  I highly recommend a stop off here even if it's just to top off.  I didn't pay attention to my charging speed, but it was plenty fast.  I was the only car of 8 stalls.  There are also a few Blink chargers installed next to the Tesla ones.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: ?/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.52\n\n\nDrive to Memphis, TN:\n\n74.9mi, 267 Wh/mi\n\n- Another wooded segment very similar to the last.  Unfortunately due to the turn off onto I-240 I didn't really get a good view of the Memphis skyline, but that's fine.\n\nMemphis, TN supercharger:\n\n- In a strip mall next to a free standing First Horizon bank.  Good accessibility from the highway and a number of eateries in the area.  Not sure where would be a good bathroom here, but the Taco Bell nearby could be a nice option.  Very clean but no garbage cans near the chargers. I'm one of 2 cars here and I'm pulling around 90kW, the slowest charge I've had all trip.  Nothing special, a little slow, but you can't go wrong here.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.89\n\n\nDrive to Little Rock, AR:\n\n168.5mi, 245 Wh/mi\n\n- I took a small detour to see the exterior of Graceland on my way out of Memphis; it was cool but not too exciting from the outside.  The landscape opened up a bit from the wooded background to more of a mix of farmland and wooded areas.  Nice view of Little Rock going through the city.  The highway had very little construction throughout my drive, and the only traffic I experienced was due to an accident in Memphis itself.\n\nLittle Rock, AR supercharger:\n\n- This one is in an outlet center between the mall, a Hooters and a movie theater.  The view here is also pretty nice with flower beds and excellent landscaping all around.  It's very close to the highway, though the GPS took me off an exit too early.  Very easy to get back onto the highway.  No garbage can right at the chargers, but there are plenty in the mall itself.  I'm one of 2 cars here in the 10 spots, pulling around 140 kW.  Overall, it's a really nice place for a stop off.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 4.5/5\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.08\n\n\nDrive to Texarkana, TX:\n\n135.3 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!  Once again a heavy thunderstorm restricted my ability to use autopilot for a good stretch of the drive.  I had to take over manually for a while, and even when cruise control returned the auto lane change was disabled.  The bolts of lightning across the sky made for an incredible backdrop\n\nTexarkana, TX supercharger:\n\n- At an Olive Garden on the outskirts of a mall.  It's right up against a one-way highway service road, and if you miss the turn off into the parking lot then it's a long way back.  If you're not from Texas, navigating the service roads can be tricky.  I missed a right turn ramp to make a U-turn which added 2 miles to my trip from the exit ramp to the charger.  Definitely confusing if it's your first time here and coming in on I-30W.  The station itself is nice enough.  I'm the only car here of 8 spots and I'm getting roughly 135 kW.  Seems well maintained, but finding it was a little bit of an issue.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nDrive to Sulphur Springs, TX:\n\n97.5 mi, 299 Wh/mi\n\n- The speed limit jumped up to 75 for almost the entirety of this stretch, which really drove down my efficiency as I set cruise control to 82 MPH for almost the entirety of the stretch.  I saw a few ranches along the way and a couple really huge churches.  Really easy drive.\n\nSulphur Springs, TX supercharger:\n\n- In a stand-alone parking lot next to a police station.  To get here from the highway, there's a quick turn off ramp that you'll need to cross a couple lanes within 500 feet of the highway exit to make the right.  To get to the charger, it's about a 2 mile scenic drive through a residential neighborhood and a classic American small town main street that I would love to come back to visit.  The Tesla spots are a nice brick paving, and well maintained.  Of the 8 spots, I'm the only car here and pulling 140 kW.  Definitely a great location to park and walk around in.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Arlington, TX:\n\n95.8 mi, 268 Wh/mi\n\n- A transition from the 2-lane highway of rural Texas to the 5+ lane highways of the Dallas metroplex.  Were it not for a thick fog and persistent rain, I would have gotten a great view of the Dallas skyline.  But coming off the highway I got a great view of Six Flags, and it really put in perspective how much taller Titan is than the New Texas Giant (both great rides from prior experience)\n\nArlington, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located behind the e-sports arena, very easy to get here from the highway - less than a mile off of it.  It's got great views of AT&amp;T stadium, Globe Life Ballpark, and a bit of the Six Flags park, with well manicured lawns surrounding this portion of the parking lot; it overlooks a small pond.  I'm not sure how accessible this would be on a game day, but at 10AM on a Saturday with no events it's plenty available.  10 stalls here, and it's me plus one other car.  I'm drawing 100 kW from this very central to activities location.  It doesn't look like there are any food or bathroom options around, but there is a nerby trash can.  If you're looking to get something to eat, use a different charger.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5 (But I can see this being a huge issue if there's a Rangers game)\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.29\n\n\nDrive to Cisco, TX:\n\n121.6 mi, 353 Wh/mi\n\n- Pouring rain until about 5 miles outside Cisco, so no autopilot this entire leg.  Nice open plains once I got further out from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nCisco, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Flying J / Shell gas station with a Denny's.  In addition to the 8 supercharger outets, there's a single J-1772 that appears to be free (I didn't check if it worked).  Bathrooms insude the gas tation, and there are windshield cleaners in the gas station area.  There's also a small outdoor seating area here.  Very easy highway on/off, and a well maintained area.  I'm the only car here, puling arorund 130 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Sweetwater, TX:\n\n86.4 mi, 303 Wh/mi\n\n- I thought this leg was thoroughly uneventful, but it seems as though I got splashed by a huge mud pile on my driver side, so I'll have to find a car wash.  Didn't notice this while driving, just when I got out of the car for a delicious steak fries lunch at a local eatery before charging.\n\nSweetwater, TX supercharger:\n\n- Back behind a Holiday Inn express.  2 other cars out of 8 spots here when I got here, and I'm around 90 kW.  A couple guys rode in on their single wheel electric skateboard type things (sorry, I don't know what they're called), so that was exciting enough.  Garbage can present and the hotel has usable bathrooms.  Fine enough, but nothing great.  No food in walking distance.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.40\n\n\nDrive to Midland, TX:\n\n113.5 mi, 276 Wh/mi\n\n0 This leg was pretty cool to see.  There were a number of oil fields along the way as well as some processing plants.  With that, there was a lot of wide open road and open big country views.  I was just disappointed by about 10 miles straight of road work that was stripped to textured pavement giving a loud, bumpy ride.\n\nMidland, TX supercharger:\n\n- At the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel next door to a Love's gas station.  The souveniers in the Love's shop are pretty cool and very \"Texas.\"  It's right off the highway with easy on and easy off, and not too hard to find.  There's some food in the gas station, but nothing great.  There's a nearby garbage can and the view is pretty meh.  Clean.  I'm the only car here of the 8 spots, drawing around 140 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Pecos, TX:\n\n90.1 mi, 259 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful mountain shaddows in the backdrop.  Wide open road and the speed limit goes up to 80.  I'm surprised how good the efficiency I got was given the speed I was going, and how my AC is going strong (it's 94 F outside with a hot sun up above).\n\nPecos, TX supercharger:\n\n- Extremely easy to get to and very easy to find.  Right off the service road at a Flying J next to the Travelodge.  The travelodge has a nice little gazebo to sit at right next to the chargers.  Good size convenience store in the Flying J with available trash cans and restrooms.  8 chargers here and I'm the only car.  I'm ulling around 130 kW so a pretty good speed of charge.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $1.26\n\n\nDrive to Van Horn, TX:\n\n90.2 mi, 311 Wh/mi\n\n- Mostly wild flowers and small bushes.  My windshield has unfortunately become an insect graveyard.  Super easy drive.  Transition to plateaus is beautiful.\n\nVan Horn, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Hampton Inn.  Only amenity is bathrooms, and there is nothing in easy walking distance of this Hampton Inn.  This stop is very easy to get to from the highway and it's simple to get back on.  Views of the mountains are pretty nice from here with a lot of open space.  I'm the only car here right now, and unfortunately I'm only pulling between 30 and 60 kW (at 4A) so I may be here for a little while before heading to my next leg.  No outdoor garbage can, but it looks like someone left just a bag of trash by the big charger box.  This is probably one of the bottom few stations that I've visited on my trip.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 1/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.27\n\n\nDrive to El Paso, TX:\n\n131.1 mi, 272 Wh/mi\n\n- The drive through El Paso is pretty interesting, and the mountain backgrounds and surroundings on the way in look really nice.  You can get a good look at Ciudad Juarez as well as you're driving in.  I have somehow spent all sunlight today in Texas despite driving West and leaving at 7AM central, along with having no traffic.\n\nEl Paso, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at Rudy's Bar-B-Q (and not the Hampton Inn behind it).  Very easy highway access.  Because I missed my turn in I learned there's a touchless automatic car wash about a half block west of it, and after the long drive today my front windshield had become a Jackson Pollock painting of fly caracasses I decided to give it a go.  Sadly, the right hand side of the machine was broken so I don't recommend using this place.  When I got here, there were 2 other Teslas taking up chargers plus one charger that was ICEd with the family having a picnic in the charging spot next to their truck.  I'm starting to see a few more Teslas now as I'm going west.  The facilities here look pretty fine and well maintained.  Despite sharing 4A/4B (I wasn't going to park next to the truck) I'm still pulling 120 kW.  This is certainly a good spot to stop at, even if it's not pretty and there's no greenery.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.08\n\n\nDrive to Deming, NM:\n\n91.6 mi, 289 Wh/mi\n\n- It was dark out but the drive was easy.  I went through a border control checkpoint to the west of Las Cruces which was really simple.  Now, for sleep after charging.\n\nDeming, NM supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Valero gas station.  8 chargers and I'm the only car here.  Roughly 130 kW of power.  The chargers are off to the side of the building and while they're easy to find the area is poorly lit.  The Valero likely has a \npretty good selection and bathroom, but I didn't go in.  Garbage can is present.  The stop is about 1 mile north of the highway.  No real green space to walk around, but a couple cute cacti around the gas station.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.04\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nDrive to Wilcox, AZ:\n\n139.4 mi, 274 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful desertscapes.  Easy drive.  Smooth highway.  After charging the previous night, I had to backtrack a little bit to get to my hotel.\n\nWilcox, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Holiday Inn Express less than a mile from the highway.  Pretty ugly area; next to a large truck parking area.  Garbage can and bathrooms available within the hotel.  8 stalls, and only me + 1 other car, I'm getting around 120 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.52\n\n\nDrive to Casa Grande, AZ:\n\n146.5 mi, 232 Wh/mi\n\n- I absolutely love the desert landscape with the amazing natural rock formations.  This was my favorite set of scenery to drive through so far.  Except for the drive next to Tucson.  Tucson is really ugly from the highway.  There were also a couple instances where the autopilot detected me on the service road thinking the speed limit was way lower than it actually was and causing me to basically brake check myself.  Other than that, it was a pretty smooth drive.\n\nCasa Grande, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located behind a Chase bank in a strip mall.  There's a good set of food options here and the area is well maintained.  3 cars here now with 8 spots and I'm getting 110 kW.  Very easy to find from the highway and exceptionally easy \non/off.  Nicely manicured rockscape around, but unfortunely the chargers are parked such that you're facing into an active roadway/alleyway (this is basically a driveway onto it) where cars are flying down.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $2.50\n\n\nDrive to Buckeye, AZ:\n\n84.6 mi, 226 Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped in Phoenix on the way to do a quick socially-distanced walk through a park with an old friend, otherwise I would have driven around Phoenix and not through it.  But this did give me some nice views of the city's skyline.  Otherwise this segment is plenty pleasant with more of the manicured desert views.  However, Hank Hill said it best.  \"Phoenix is a testament to man's hubris.\"\n\nBuckeye, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Great location just off the highway in a small strip mall at a Carl's Jr.  There's plenty of food options and bathrooms here, and there's extremely easy highway access.  3 cars here including me at the 8 charging spots, and I'm getting roughly 110 kW.  The mall did a fine job on the landscaping but nothing too exciting.  I'll probably make a stop here each time I travel to Phoenix as it's pleasant and on my way.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 4.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Ehrenberg, AZ:\n\n116.9 mi, 291 Wh/mi\n\n- Nice desertscape with a few mountains.  Easy drive.  Very boring.  Almost back to CA!\n\nEhrenberg, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Very easy to get to via a roundabout.  Located between a Best Western and a Flying J that has a Wendy's.  A little bit of open green space in front of the chargers, but there's a giant gas tank on it and a weird smell here.  There are 8 chargers here, and I'm one of 3 Teslas plus 1 ICE here.  For about half a minute I was drawing the full rated 250 kW, but I've settled down around 170 for most of my charging session.  Definitely stop here instead of the Quartzsite location - they're about 15 miles apart on the same highway, but this one offers so much more.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.89\n\n\nDrive to Cabazon, CA:\n\n140.4 mi, 296 Wh/mi\n\n- I've done the later portion of this many times as I visit Palm Desert a few times a year.  The drive through the windmills is really cool.  Nice drive, open highway, this area always reminds me of home.\n\nCabazon, CA supercharger:\n\n- Located in an outlet mall with a really good variety of shops.  Right behind a McDonalds at one end of the outlets, these are all pull-forward stalls, with over a dozen available stalls, but I have had to wait for one due to heavy traffic here in the past.  There's a lot of trash all around here with a dumpster between a couple stations.  Very easy on/off.  One thing different about the CA superchargers - you pay by the kW, not by the minute leading to a much higher total price for supercharging, almost double the rate at other chargers around the country.  I'm getting a consistent 110 kW here.\n\nCleanliness: 2/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $9.24\n\n\nDrive to home:\n\n114.8 mi, 215 Wh/mi\n\n- I live in the San Fernando Valley, so I navigate on autopilot through a variety of freeway interchanges until I am finally home.  This has been an incredible road trip, I just wish it were under better circumstances.  I'm still shocked how easy this was to do and hope my experience can help others as they plan massive trips - it can certainly be done in an EV!\n\nDay 1: 746.9 mi, 257.5 Wh/mi\n\nDay 2: 689.3 mi, 262.1 Wh/mi\n\nDay 3: 917.8 mi, 292.8 Wh/mi\n\nDay 4: 742.6 mi, 258.0 Wh/mi\n\nTotal: 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86",

      "text": "I recently traveled back from New York to Los Angeles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, 18\" Aero wheels (which I've named Marvin) after spending a couple months with my mom during the COVID-19 crisis.  I decided to head back home to LA since the restrictions are loosening in NY at the time of departure and my mom is getting along well.  I took minimal breaks and doing no sightseeing as I traverse the country, and figured I'd write up my experience for anyone interested.  I'll have summary statistics at the end with total distance, kWh used, efficiency, and total cost.  I'm happy to answer any questions about my trip!\n\n\ntl;dr: 4 days, 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86\n\n\nNight 0/Day 1 -\n\n\nStony Brook area to Ridgewood.  Stayed the night with family there, and did not charge that night.  I woke up around 8 AM and started out west from there.  My first charging stop was in Allentown, PA.  The drive was overall pleasant, through mostly suburban highways.  Most of the driving was 2 lane, very little traffic and autopilot worked flawlessly.  There was a $1 toll for one of the small bridges on my route.  I didn't calculate the total miles and efficiency, but the Ridgewood to Allentown portion was roughly 100 miles at 253 Wh/mi.\n\n\nAllentown supercharging spot:\n\n- Large strip mall.  There's a number of smaller eateries and a drive through fast food place, including a Jamba Juice that is great for breakfast smoothies.  8 stalls all of 150kW speed, I actually got around 120.  During my roughly 30 minutes there only 1 other car showed up.  Unfortunately, there's no obvious public restroom here.  Overall this stop is very clean and well maintained, but unremarkable.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 3.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility (ease to find from the highway): 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic Views: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal price: $14.31\n\n\nDrive to Somerset:\n\n210.3 miles, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- There were some really beautiful mountains and tunnels on the route from Allentown to Somerset.  The winding PA Turnpike through the Blue Ridge mountains was incredible, and rural PA is super pleasant to drive through.  Unfortunately there was a good bit of construction that brought it down to one lane with a 40 MPH speed limit, but due to light traffic this wasn't much of a problem.  Again, autopilot handled this very well, but I took over during the construction zones out of an abundance of caution.  There was a toll on the PA Turnpike, but I don't know how much it is yet due to bill by mail.\n\n\nSomerset, PA supercharging spot:\n\n- Right next to the highway.  The only eatery in the area is a Wendy's which seems to be the only spot with an accessible restroom; the charging spot is between a Verizon, the Wendy's, a car wash, and what I think is a dance studio?  I'm getting my advertised 120 kW of power, but of the 6 stalls I'm the only car here for the full half hour that I'm charging.  This station is well but not exceptionally maintained and clean, but not particularly great.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal price: $13.52\n\n\nDrive to Cambridge, OH:\n\n154.8mi, 236 Wh/mi\n\n- A very nice scenic drive through the forest of western Pennsylvania, the country (OK, interstate) roads of West Virginia, and eastern Ohio.  As soon as I left Somerset it started raining lightly, so I was slowed a bit by that.  I-70W was closed through Wheeling, WV so there was a small detour onto 470.  Autopilot did have a small issue in a construction zone where the old lane lines were still visible and there were diverging lines on the left, making the car think the lane was turning when it was staying straight.  Again, there was a small toll on the highway, but I don't know how much it was due to bill by mail.\n\nCambridge, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a Sheetz gas station less than a mile off the highway, with a traffic light to help you make the left heading back to the highway.  This serves as the primary eatery and restroom in the area; there is a Denny's next door about a 300 foot walk.  Bathroom is very clean, as is the parking lot.  Also in the strip mall here is a Dollar General which I guess you can pick up something if you need to.  Again, I am the only car here out of 8 stalls, pulling 125kW, but it dropped to 100 kW when about 60% charged.  Overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.64\n\n\nDrive to Cincinnati, OH:\n\n177.6 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- I wasn't sure if I was going to stop at this one or Columbus in between.  As I was driving into Columbus I saw that I would have a rated ~160 miles to get the ~100 miles further to Cincinnati, so I went for it and made it here with about 10% left on the battery.  As I entered Columbus and the scenery shifted from wooded to more open plains, the skies opened up as well with large heavy thunderstorms.  These caused autopilot to become unavailable with the \"Take control immediately\" message popping up.  The heavy rains dropped my efficiency pretty significantly for this leg of the journey so I had to slow down a bit to make it to Cincinnati with enough charge to be comfortable.  This was definitely the most strenuous but most enjoyable leg of the journey so far.  Driving through the rain was beautiful and I really felt in control.\n\nCincinnati, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a meijer supermarket parking lot.  It's about 2 miles off the highway with a number of turns and traffic lights to get to it, and the GPS took me in through the delivery/loading docks.  The spots for this charger are freshly paved in stark contrast with the rest of the lot.  Also in this parking lot is a Target, so there are probably accesible bathrooms.  Best place for food is going to be the meijer supermarket.  No garbage cans anywhere near the chargers.  For the charge itself, there's me and one other car charging in the 10 stalls and I started with pulling 120kW but that dropped throughout my charging session.  This is a fine enough location but a bit difficult to find/out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $7.15\n\n\nDrive to Louisville, KY:\n\n104.2 mi, 262 Wh/mi\n\n- Somehow Cincinnati was the first city that I actually drove through and not just around.  I got a good view of the baseball and football stadiums from the highway, and the roads were very manageable.  On the woodsy highway through Kentucky, I was surprised how many highway patrol cars I saw with their lights off in the shoulder after dusk.  I finally checked in to my hotel around 10PM after a very full day of driving.  My hotel is about 3 miles from the supercharging station and I forgot to track my actual distance and usage for this short bit.\n\nDay 2:\n\nLouisville supercharger:\n\n- Located at a college annex building's parking lot, the associated bakery has been sadly shut down.  The stalls are nice and well kept but I didn't note my actual power draw while there as I walked over to the bakery to find it closed instead.  There are no garbage cans in this lot, and there is a coffee shop in easy walking distance across the street.  The station is right off the highway and it's very easy to get back on.  There was 1 other car there out of the 8 stalls.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: ??/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.94\n\n\nDrive to Bowling Green, KY:\n\n113.5 mi, 271Wh/mi\n\n- Another rainy segment as the skies parted as I exited Louisville and closed again when I entered Bowling Green.  Mostly 3 lane highway, very easily navigable.\n\nBowling Green, KY supercharger:\n\n- Located at another meijer supermarket, this one is off to the side by a large field.  It's about 4 miles off from the highway, making it less accessible for road tripping purposes.  It's a very pleasant suburban drive down to the charger along relatively large county roads.  Other than the meijer, there are no shops or eateries in easy waling distance.  I'm the only car here of the 8 stalls, pulling between 100 and 115kW.  Overall it's a nice spot if a little out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 4/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Dickson, TN (West of Nashville):\n\n102.5 mi, 264Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped for lunch with a cousin in the suburbs.  Very easy pair of segments.  Nice transition into mountainy roads, beautiful scenery and view of the Nashville skyline on the way.\n\nDickson, TN supercharger:\n\n- At a Holiday Inn Express, 2B appears damaged like someone backed into it.  I'm the only car here at the 8 chargers getting 130 kW.  There's a restaurant nearby in walking distance.  No nearby trash can.  Easy to get here from the highway.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Jackson, TN:\n\n94.6mi, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- Nothing special, but very pleasant.  Good wooded road well paved and fast moving.\n\nJackson, TN supercharger:\n\n- By far the nicest supercharging spot that I've been to so far on this trip.  Unfortunately, the spot is a bit awkward to get to from I-40W as the exit takes you one way and you need to take a U-turn on a surface street.  Luckily, that side street goes by a number of drive-throughs and I got my guilty pleasure that's only a southern thing - Cookout.  Had I not, I would have gotten to eat at the general store, a traditional bakery and had time to explore a small gift shop and train museum, or even play a round of mini-golf (were it not closed due to the pandemic).  There was a classic Pullman car directly in front of the chargers and this was a really cool atmosphere.  I highly recommend a stop off here even if it's just to top off.  I didn't pay attention to my charging speed, but it was plenty fast.  I was the only car of 8 stalls.  There are also a few Blink chargers installed next to the Tesla ones.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: ?/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.52\n\n\nDrive to Memphis, TN:\n\n74.9mi, 267 Wh/mi\n\n- Another wooded segment very similar to the last.  Unfortunately due to the turn off onto I-240 I didn't really get a good view of the Memphis skyline, but that's fine.\n\nMemphis, TN supercharger:\n\n- In a strip mall next to a free standing First Horizon bank.  Good accessibility from the highway and a number of eateries in the area.  Not sure where would be a good bathroom here, but the Taco Bell nearby could be a nice option.  Very clean but no garbage cans near the chargers. I'm one of 2 cars here and I'm pulling around 90kW, the slowest charge I've had all trip.  Nothing special, a little slow, but you can't go wrong here.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.89\n\n\nDrive to Little Rock, AR:\n\n168.5mi, 245 Wh/mi\n\n- I took a small detour to see the exterior of Graceland on my way out of Memphis; it was cool but not too exciting from the outside.  The landscape opened up a bit from the wooded background to more of a mix of farmland and wooded areas.  Nice view of Little Rock going through the city.  The highway had very little construction throughout my drive, and the only traffic I experienced was due to an accident in Memphis itself.\n\nLittle Rock, AR supercharger:\n\n- This one is in an outlet center between the mall, a Hooters and a movie theater.  The view here is also pretty nice with flower beds and excellent landscaping all around.  It's very close to the highway, though the GPS took me off an exit too early.  Very easy to get back onto the highway.  No garbage can right at the chargers, but there are plenty in the mall itself.  I'm one of 2 cars here in the 10 spots, pulling around 140 kW.  Overall, it's a really nice place for a stop off.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 4.5/5\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.08\n\n\nDrive to Texarkana, TX:\n\n135.3 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!  Once again a heavy thunderstorm restricted my ability to use autopilot for a good stretch of the drive.  I had to take over manually for a while, and even when cruise control returned the auto lane change was disabled.  The bolts of lightning across the sky made for an incredible backdrop\n\nTexarkana, TX supercharger:\n\n- At an Olive Garden on the outskirts of a mall.  It's right up against a one-way highway service road, and if you miss the turn off into the parking lot then it's a long way back.  If you're not from Texas, navigating the service roads can be tricky.  I missed a right turn ramp to make a U-turn which added 2 miles to my trip from the exit ramp to the charger.  Definitely confusing if it's your first time here and coming in on I-30W.  The station itself is nice enough.  I'm the only car here of 8 spots and I'm getting roughly 135 kW.  Seems well maintained, but finding it was a little bit of an issue.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nDrive to Sulphur Springs, TX:\n\n97.5 mi, 299 Wh/mi\n\n- The speed limit jumped up to 75 for almost the entirety of this stretch, which really drove down my efficiency as I set cruise control to 82 MPH for almost the entirety of the stretch.  I saw a few ranches along the way and a couple really huge churches.  Really easy drive.\n\nSulphur Springs, TX supercharger:\n\n- In a stand-alone parking lot next to a police station.  To get here from the highway, there's a quick turn off ramp that you'll need to cross a couple lanes within 500 feet of the highway exit to make the right.  To get to the charger, it's about a 2 mile scenic drive through a residential neighborhood and a classic American small town main street that I would love to come back to visit.  The Tesla spots are a nice brick paving, and well maintained.  Of the 8 spots, I'm the only car here and pulling 140 kW.  Definitely a great location to park and walk around in.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Arlington, TX:\n\n95.8 mi, 268 Wh/mi\n\n- A transition from the 2-lane highway of rural Texas to the 5+ lane highways of the Dallas metroplex.  Were it not for a thick fog and persistent rain, I would have gotten a great view of the Dallas skyline.  But coming off the highway I got a great view of Six Flags, and it really put in perspective how much taller Titan is than the New Texas Giant (both great rides from prior experience)\n\nArlington, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located behind the e-sports arena, very easy to get here from the highway - less than a mile off of it.  It's got great views of AT&amp;T stadium, Globe Life Ballpark, and a bit of the Six Flags park, with well manicured lawns surrounding this portion of the parking lot; it overlooks a small pond.  I'm not sure how accessible this would be on a game day, but at 10AM on a Saturday with no events it's plenty available.  10 stalls here, and it's me plus one other car.  I'm drawing 100 kW from this very central to activities location.  It doesn't look like there are any food or bathroom options around, but there is a nerby trash can.  If you're looking to get something to eat, use a different charger.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5 (But I can see this being a huge issue if there's a Rangers game)\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.29\n\n\nDrive to Cisco, TX:\n\n121.6 mi, 353 Wh/mi\n\n- Pouring rain until about 5 miles outside Cisco, so no autopilot this entire leg.  Nice open plains once I got further out from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nCisco, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Flying J / Shell gas station with a Denny's.  In addition to the 8 supercharger outets, there's a single J-1772 that appears to be free (I didn't check if it worked).  Bathrooms insude the gas tation, and there are windshield cleaners in the gas station area.  There's also a small outdoor seating area here.  Very easy highway on/off, and a well maintained area.  I'm the only car here, puling arorund 130 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Sweetwater, TX:\n\n86.4 mi, 303 Wh/mi\n\n- I thought this leg was thoroughly uneventful, but it seems as though I got splashed by a huge mud pile on my driver side, so I'll have to find a car wash.  Didn't notice this while driving, just when I got out of the car for a delicious steak fries lunch at a local eatery before charging.\n\nSweetwater, TX supercharger:\n\n- Back behind a Holiday Inn express.  2 other cars out of 8 spots here when I got here, and I'm around 90 kW.  A couple guys rode in on their single wheel electric skateboard type things (sorry, I don't know what they're called), so that was exciting enough.  Garbage can present and the hotel has usable bathrooms.  Fine enough, but nothing great.

There were a number of oil fields along the way as well as some processing plants.  With that, there was a lot of wide open road and open big country views.  I was just disappointed by about 10 miles straight of road work that was stripped to textured pavement giving a loud, bumpy ride.\n\nMidland, TX supercharger:\n\n- At the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel next door to a Love's gas station.  The souveniers in the Love's shop are pretty cool and very \"Texas.\"  It's right off the highway with easy on and easy off, and not too hard to find.  There's some food in the gas station, but nothing great.  There's a nearby garbage can and the view is pretty meh.  Clean.  I'm the only car here of the 8 spots, drawing around 140 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Pecos, TX:\n\n90.1 mi, 259 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful mountain shaddows in the backdrop.  Wide open road and the speed limit goes up to 80.  I'm surprised how good the efficiency I got was given the speed I was going, and how my AC is going strong (it's 94 F outside with a hot sun up above).\n\nPecos, TX supercharger:\n\n- Extremely easy to get to and very easy to find.  Right off the service road at a Flying J next to the Travelodge.  The travelodge has a nice little gazebo to sit at right next to the chargers.  Good size convenience store in the Flying J with available trash cans and restrooms.  8 chargers here and I'm the only car.  I'm ulling around 130 kW so a pretty good speed of charge.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $1.26\n\n\nDrive to Van Horn, TX:\n\n90.2 mi, 311 Wh/mi\n\n- Mostly wild flowers and small bushes.  My windshield has unfortunately become an insect graveyard.  Super easy drive.  Transition to plateaus is beautiful.\n\nVan Horn, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Hampton Inn.  Only amenity is bathrooms, and there is nothing in easy walking distance of this Hampton Inn.  This stop is very easy to get to from the highway and it's simple to get back on.  Views of the mountains are pretty nice from here with a lot of open space.  I'm the only car here right now, and unfortunately I'm only pulling between 30 and 60 kW (at 4A) so I may be here for a little while before heading to my next leg.  No outdoor garbage can, but it looks like someone left just a bag of trash by the big charger box.  This is probably one of the bottom few stations that I've visited on my trip.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 1/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.27\n\n\nDrive to El Paso, TX:\n\n131.1 mi, 272 Wh/mi\n\n- The drive through El Paso is pretty interesting, and the mountain backgrounds and surroundings on the way in look really nice.  You can get a good look at Ciudad Juarez as well as you're driving in.  I have somehow spent all sunlight today in Texas despite driving West and leaving at 7AM central, along with having no traffic.\n\nEl Paso, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at Rudy's Bar-B-Q (and not the Hampton Inn behind it).  Very easy highway access.  Because I missed my turn in I learned there's a touchless automatic car wash about a half block west of it, and after the long drive today my front windshield had become a Jackson Pollock painting of fly caracasses I decided to give it a go.  Sadly, the right hand side of the machine was broken so I don't recommend using this place.  When I got here, there were 2 other Teslas taking up chargers plus one charger that was ICEd with the family having a picnic in the charging spot next to their truck.  I'm starting to see a few more Teslas now as I'm going west.  The facilities here look pretty fine and well maintained.  Despite sharing 4A/4B (I wasn't going to park next to the truck) I'm still pulling 120 kW.  This is certainly a good spot to stop at, even if it's not pretty and there's no greenery.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.08\n\n\nDrive to Deming, NM:\n\n91.6 mi, 289 Wh/mi\n\n- It was dark out but the drive was easy.  I went through a border control checkpoint to the west of Las Cruces which was really simple.  Now, for sleep after charging.\n\nDeming, NM supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Valero gas station.  8 chargers and I'm the only car here.  Roughly 130 kW of power.  The chargers are off to the side of the building and while they're easy to find the area is poorly lit.  The Valero likely has a \npretty good selection and bathroom, but I didn't go in.  Garbage can is present.  The stop is about 1 mile north of the highway.  No real green space to walk around, but a couple cute cacti around the gas station.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.04\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nDrive to Wilcox, AZ:\n\n139.4 mi, 274 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful desertscapes.  Easy drive.  Smooth highway.  After charging the previous night, I had to backtrack a little bit to get to my hotel.\n\nWilcox, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Holiday Inn Express less than a mile from the highway.  Pretty ugly area; next to a large truck parking area.  Garbage can and bathrooms available within the hotel.  8 stalls, and only me + 1 other car, I'm getting around 120 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.52\n\n\nDrive to Casa Grande, AZ:\n\n146.5 mi, 232 Wh/mi\n\n- I absolutely love the desert landscape with the amazing natural rock formations.  This was my favorite set of scenery to drive through so far.  Except for the drive next to Tucson.  Tucson is really ugly from the highway.  There were also a couple instances where the autopilot detected me on the service road thinking the speed limit was way lower than it actually was and causing me to basically brake check myself.  Other than that, it was a pretty smooth drive.\n\nCasa Grande, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located behind a Chase bank in a strip mall.  There's a good set of food options here and the area is well maintained.  3 cars here now with 8 spots and I'm getting 110 kW.  Very easy to find from the highway and exceptionally easy \non/off.  Nicely manicured rockscape around, but unfortunely the chargers are parked such that you're facing into an active roadway/alleyway (this is basically a driveway onto it) where cars are flying down.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $2.50\n\n\nDrive to Buckeye, AZ:\n\n84.6 mi, 226 Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped in Phoenix on the way to do a quick socially-distanced walk through a park with an old friend, otherwise I would have driven around Phoenix and not through it.  But this did give me some nice views of the city's skyline.  Otherwise this segment is plenty pleasant with more of the manicured desert views.  However, Hank Hill said it best.  \"Phoenix is a testament to man's hubris.\"\n\nBuckeye, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Great location just off the highway in a small strip mall at a Carl's Jr.  There's plenty of food options and bathrooms here, and there's extremely easy highway access.  3 cars here including me at the 8 charging spots, and I'm getting roughly 110 kW.  The mall did a fine job on the landscaping but nothing too exciting.  I'll probably make a stop here each time I travel to Phoenix as it's pleasant and on my way.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 4.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Ehrenberg, AZ:\n\n116.9 mi, 291 Wh/mi\n\n- Nice desertscape with a few mountains.  Easy drive.  Very boring.  Almost back to CA!\n\nEhrenberg, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Very easy to get to via a roundabout.  Located between a Best Western and a Flying J that has a Wendy's.  A little bit of open green space in front of the chargers, but there's a giant gas tank on it and a weird smell here.  There are 8 chargers here, and I'm one of 3 Teslas plus 1 ICE here.  For about half a minute I was drawing the full rated 250 kW, but I've settled down around 170 for most of my charging session.  Definitely stop here instead of the Quartzsite location - they're about 15 miles apart on the same highway, but this one offers so much more.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.89\n\n\nDrive to Cabazon, CA:\n\n140.4 mi, 296 Wh/mi\n\n- I've done the later portion of this many times as I visit Palm Desert a few times a year.  The drive through the windmills is really cool.  Nice drive, open highway, this area always reminds me of home.\n\nCabazon, CA supercharger:\n\n- Located in an outlet mall with a really good variety of shops.  Right behind a McDonalds at one end of the outlets, these are all pull-forward stalls, with over a dozen available stalls, but I have had to wait for one due to heavy traffic here in the past.  There's a lot of trash all around here with a dumpster between a couple stations.  Very easy on/off.  One thing different about the CA superchargers - you pay by the kW, not by the minute leading to a much higher total price for supercharging, almost double the rate at other chargers around the country.  I'm getting a consistent 110 kW here.\n\nCleanliness: 2/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $9.24\n\n\nDrive to home:\n\n114.8 mi, 215 Wh/mi\n\n- I live in the San Fernando Valley, so I navigate on autopilot through a variety of freeway interchanges until I am finally home.  This has been an incredible road trip, I just wish it were under better circumstances.  I'm still shocked how easy this was to do and hope my experience can help others as they plan massive trips - it can certainly be done in an EV!\n\nDay 1: 746.9 mi, 257.5 Wh/mi\n\nDay 2: 689.3 mi, 262.1 Wh/mi\n\nDay 3: 917.8 mi, 292.8 Wh/mi\n\nDay 4: 742.6 mi, 258.0 Wh/mi\n\nTotal: 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86",

      "text": "Three days ago I swapped the original Michelin tires for Hankook iON evo AS tires, and I\u0019m here to tell you how it went. I mean - if you\u0019re interested, anyway. \n\nWe left today for a quick trip to Chattanooga, from just north of Atlanta. \n\nWhite 2021 model 3 SR+(my daughter loves blue so that\u0019s why it\u0019s blue on the screen)\n\nTesla branded roof rack and a Thule high road bike rack I forgot to take off but turned out it\u0019s probably good anyway because that keeps the numbers real. \n\nHankook claims that:\n\nThe tires are quieter. I can confirm this - I actually thought there was something wrong with the car after they were installed. \n\nBetter grip/traction. Nothing scientific here but I can say that the vehicle does seem to handle better. But the Michelins were at about 3mm so who knows. \n\nEfficiency improvement. Image speaks for itself. Other than a quick stop off at a bucees\u0019s we maintained about 70-75mph after we left stop and go (yellow) in Atlanta and the graph is SOLID green after that. We beat projected arrival in Chattanooga by over 12% battery (originally expected to have 8% on arrival). \n\nFor only $1400 for a set of 4 tires with 50k tread warranty - I\u0019m gonna go ahead and say - first impression is solid.",

      "title": "Going back to gas...",
      "text": "\n2013...\n\nThat\u0019s the year I first joined the Tesla Family with a fully spec\u0019d out P85. I, like many of us Tesla fans went full blown fan boy in 3.2 seconds.  It was love at first sight and I was determined to live a long life without the need of gas ever again. \n\nSix months into a blissful ownership experience I had to schedule my first service. I was so excited. Tesla came to my house with a loaner, reviewed paperwork, and took my P85 off for its first regular maintenance (that was a thing back then).  \n\nEverything seemed to go fine until I got a phone call while I was watching my car come back to me on the app. It was the flat bed truck driver. There was an accident and the big straps that secured my vehicle to the flat bed had broken and my car was damaged. \n\nTesla\u0019s response to the accident was horrendous. It took two plus months to get my car back. I had originally requested a new car.  I didn\u0019t want to assume depreciation for an accident that I had no part of and I wanted my brand new unscathed P85 back in original form.   I had plenty of examples of dealerships replacing cars outright under similar circumstances.  They didn\u0019t. The whole experience was shitty and stressful but I stuck with it because I loved the movement. \n\nI should have known then that the next 7 years would be what I can only describe as an abusive relationship.  Every single service appointment had either a minor mishap or full blown \u001cI want a whole new car\u001d issue. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I drop off my 2018 M3P to the service center for the squeaky front suspension issue. I posted about it here because I didn\u0019t like how they didn\u0019t automatically assume this was a warranty repair. So you can read that if you\u0019re interested lol. \n\nI never would have predicted what would happen next. \n\nDropped off the car Friday morning. Nothing was done the whole day. Typical but at this point I don\u0019t expect great customer service so whatever.   That night we had some thunderstorms roll through but nothing that made me fear what I\u0019d hear after the weekend. \n\nMonday afternoon I get a phone call from the service center. My car was caught in a serious flood Friday night. The water rose up over the interior seats, the battery is damaged, and the car would probably be totaled. \n\nNow clearly this is an Act of God and no ones fault.  However, I wanted to see how Tesla would handle this.  I wanted to give them a chance to exceed my expectations. \n\nFirst - they want me to use my insurance.  For many reasons that I\u0019m not listing here. No. That\u0019s not an option. The car was under your care. \n\nSecond - it\u0019s been a week and no loaner or rental has been offered.  I know loaners are in short supply. Offer me something. Anything. I\u0019ve got nothing. \n\nThird - I made an appointment to visit the service center and remove things out of my car. When I arrived, the battery was being decharged and I was told I couldn\u0019t go inside the car for risk of injury. Fine.  They weren\u0019t even going to let me get my belongings or see my car. I pushed back and asked if they could get everything for me since I had an appointment.\n\nI noticed a lot more damage than they told me so I took out my phone to take pictures. You would have thought I was about to set off a bomb. When I took out my phone, a service tech ran over to me trying to grab my phone out of my hand, screaming at me to stop, and told me I couldn\u0019t take pictures without signing an NDA. \n\nI was floored, ready to absolutely blow my top, but I kept my cool because I realized that wouldn\u0019t accomplish anything. \n\nIf I wasn\u0019t already done with Tesla. This did the trick. I couldn\u0019t believe it. He was almost physically attacking me and screaming at me. I had done nothing other than take my phone out. \n\nI immediately called a lawyer from the parking lot. To see what I could do to extract every penny out of them for this damage. \n\nI have no idea how this will play out. Tesla is still refusing to take any responsibility or show any care for me as a long term customer and advocate for the brand. If this were my first negative experience, it would be enough for me to go buy a car elsewhere.  However, this has been the most recent of literally 15 - 20 service calls over the where Tesla\u0019s reaction and support of my issues has been so far below reasonable expectation that it is time for me to walk away. \n\nSo take this cautionary tale for what it\u0019s worth. My experience isn\u0019t everyone\u0019s and I hope that they work to improve this. Because this experience does not live up to the hype that driving the car generates. Part of owning a car is the ownership experience. Tesla is failing at this miserably. \n\nI\u0019m left with no idea of how I\u0019m getting reimbursed, what I\u0019m getting reimbursed for, who is going to do it, and what I\u0019m supposed to do while I have no car.  \n\nI wish you all the best. Those 0-60 runs and supercharger trips have been a blast. But I\u0019m going to give them another 7 years to figure the service and support end out until I come back. \n\nUntil then...back to gas.",

Pull the large pin (There's a little tab you need to push to pull this back and out, make sure you do that, I was stumped for a while as to why I couldn't get this pin out)\n6. Connect to cable and replace the other end to t he vehicle.\n7. Pull the panels along passenger door and the bottom of the b-piller\n8. connect final cable (This is the blue cable at the bottom of the harness), reattach.\n9. Put everything back together.\n\nIt activates the 4 unused speakers in the Model 3 RWD, def fills the sound in in the front and is a nice upgrade.\n\nIt's not a game changer like adding a sub-woofer would be, but for $65 and 1 hour of work, I think it was worth it.",

      "title": "Thoughts after first 5k miles with 23 M3P",
      "text": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the M3P I purchased earlier this year and wanted to share some thoughts for anyone thinking of jumping in.  \n\nI'll start with some dislikes first:\n\nPaint - I went with white because it's free and because I live in the desert where any other color is going to get nuclear hot in a short time.  The paint on delivery was pretty much fine - no obvious defects other than a tiny spot on the hood where there was some contaminant under the paint.  But in just under 5k miles, the front bumper looks like absolute hell.  Chips galore, almost all down to the black plastic underneath.  The fremont paint is pretty worthless at standing up to the tiniest of rocks.  You can either accept that you'll need a repaint, or do PPF.  \n\nBasic Autopilot / Autosteer Beta - Utterly embarassing.  Coming from a Volvo with PA, the ADAS in the Tesla feels horribly implemented.  Phantom braking galore, freaks out when lanes widen, etc.  It's just not predictable, which is a must when you're designing a system of this type.  I really dislike that it automatically disables with even minor steering input - there's a pretty fine line between the amount of steering input required to let the system know you're there and the amount that immediately disables autosteer.  I don't think this is going to get much better down the road either, between the hardware that's missing and the fact they've already been working on it so long and are yet so far behind other manufacturers.  Not a huge deal for me, as I really only use it on long road trips, and it's not nearly as bad on the interstate as it is on highways.\n\nWheels - The uberturbines are kind of cool looking, but that's about it.  I'm going to get some 18s to replace them.  Looking forward to a smoother ride and better economy.\n\nSound - Cabin noise levels aren't terrible, but without a gas powered white noise generator directly in front of you, road noise is a lot more apparent. I put in the front wheel well insulation from RPMTesla and slapped some dynamat inside the front fender while I was at it and it made a huge difference.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nInterior - Wasn't sure how I'd feel about the single screen situation, but it has been pretty seamless.  The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the audio is great.  0 rattles or squeaks have manifested so far.\n\nPrice of ownership - Electricity is pretty cheap where I live (12.5 cents/kwh) so my costs to keep it running with at home level 2 have been minimal.  I've done 79% of my charging at home and only 21% at superchargers.  While my supercharging rate is nearly 4x more expensive (42 cents/kwh), it's not exactly breaking the bank to top off on road trips.\n\nPerformance - Hard to not smile when you floor it.  Braking could be improved, but coupled with max regen is perfectly adequate.  Steering feels precise and has good feedback.  Tiny gripe is that the turning circle feels pretty wide given the overall size of the car, but it isn't something I notice much.\n\nInfrastructure - Out west, supercharging makes ownership extremely easy.  0 range anxiety on any of my trips.  The only place I've looked into going where it might be a hassle is a long roadtrip to Yosemite from east of the park - there's just not a lot of options around there.  \n\nOverall I'm very happy with my purchase and think this vehicle is tough to beat as a daily commuter.  It's a strange package altogether to be sure - midrange price, miniscule cost to own, accelerates like a solid rocket, and farts on demand?  \n\nAnyway, longish post, hope this helps anyone considering a purchase.",

      "title": "How Tesla Determines Degradation",
      "text": "Hey Tesla family. I know there have been a lot of posts discussing battery degradation and how we can assess real world degradation. I had an extended discussion with my local service center\u0019s lead technician, and he showed me some of their tools and test results from the battery health check. I tried to take pictures, but he quickly explained he would get reprimanded or fired if I did.\n\nThe battery health check has three components to it:\n1. How did the car perform on their longest drive within the last 30 days?\n2. Are there any errors or codes coming up in the HV system that don\u0019t show up as a displayed error on the screen?\n3. How does this car\u0019s Amp Hours compare to all Teslas of the same build?\n\nSo regarding the first test, they are able to see all your recent trips, and check to see the car\u0019s watt hours per mile for that trip. According to the technician, they want to see if the car is being used for a lot of aggressive launches, high speeds, etc. to see if that is causing rapid wear on the battery. I was at 260 wh/mile.\n\nThe second is basically a thumbs up/thumbs down situation. In my case, there were no errors so there was nothing to show.\n\nThe third test had the most information. It showed my car\u0019s battery (LR) amp hours compared to all other same-sized batteries of the same vehicle in the fleet, both brand new and first LR off the line. He noted that performance models were included in this summary. I\u0019m not sure if RWD would be included. This display also showed the bell curve of degradation for all Model 3s. The (assumed) brand new cars were at or close to 220 amp hours. My car was on the depressing side of the bell curve at 201 amp hours. The top of the bell curve was around 207 amp hours. The technician confirmed the displayed range accurately reflects battery degradation as long as the battery isn\u0019t very cold, and the owner has attempted to rebalance the battery (The Manager also confirmed the displayed range reflects the car\u0019s degradation). You could also hover over each bar on the bell curve to see the % of cars at the same level of degradation. 2.7% of Model 3s are at 201 amp hours. That is not a cumulative %. The technician estimated my car is within the 6-9 percentile in degradation (280 displayed range at 100%)\n\nIf you want to learn your battery\u0019s health, you can call and ask for a battery health check, and ask them to tell you your amp hour, and what percentage of Teslas have the same level of amp hours. It\u0019s also worth noting that the manager confirmed he is not aware of any Model 3 batteries being replaced from too much degradation. Model 3 battery replacement at this service center always had an intervening variable. He has seen Model S batteries replaced from excessive degradation.\n\nI hope you found this as interesting as I did. \n\nP.S. I also learned they plan out bug fixes many software updates in advance. My front speakers are cutting out periodically, and they said the software team has slated to work on a fix for that issue in version 40, but they still need more data points to nail down the problem.",

      "text": "Hi everybody! As the title states, I was given the surprising news last week that I would be getting a Model 3, an exceedingly generous graduation gift that I absolutely did not expect and do not deserve. I had been planning on buying myself a Toyota Yaris next year, lol!\n\nAnyhow, delivery is expected in March! I chose the midnight silver metallic color, black interior, and aero wheels.\n\nMy questions for the community are:\n\n- I live in the Bay Area, but currently do not have access to a charger for overnight in my living space. Is this going to be a big issue?\n\n- What was the learning curve like for you switching to electric? I\u0019ve never driven anything but gas powered vehicles.\n\n- How difficult are the wheel caps accessories to put on? I\u0019d like to remove the aero covers but heard installation can be tricky. (EDIT: I am extremely embarrassed to find out how simple this was >!)\n\n- Is there anything you wish you knew before you\u0019d purchased your Model 3? I\u0019m all ears!\n\nAny info is appreciated, thank you! :)\n\nEDIT: Yes it was a college graduation, not high school, dear lord that would be even more obscene. Also, I\u0019m 28 years old so I\u0019m a more experienced driver than younger graduates, which I think played a tiny part in all this.\n\nEDIT 2: Wow! I\u0019m floored at how welcoming you have all been and the amazing tips and advice I\u0019ve been given, you went in to so much more detail than I ever expected and I\u0019m so grateful!\n\nI was a bit nervous posting here and including the fact that it was a gift for fear of being judged or written off as some spoiled brat, but figured it was important to add because otherwise I\u0019m sure people would have just asked why I didn\u0019t do more research before buying the car, haha! Anyhow, thanks again everyone!\n\nP.S. & As icing on the cake, my delivery was just bumped up to January-February, so I\u0019m stoked!",

      "text": "I have thought long &amp; hard about switching from ICE vehicles to EV after my 2012 Buick Regal died on me after loads of expenses put into it. My research led me to Tesla, which now that I NEED a car, I decided will be my car. \n\nA friend recommended buying a Tesla from Hertz as they are cheap with low mileage. I felt relieved when I saw the deals/prices! For instance, theres a 2023 Model 3 with 35K miles for $26K. Thats within budget for me, &amp; for it to be a 2023 with such lowish miles, it feels like a steal! \n\nHowever I looked on Reddit &amp; got a perspective I never would have thought of on my own& People abusing rentals? I dont even know what that means. I personally am always extra careful with rentals because theyre not mine. Yet people were commenting about rentals basically being beaters? \n\nI am new to the world of EV, and it seems like its so much simpler with less maintenance in. So I am trying to figure out the real downsides of buying from a place like Hertz? What is the absolute worse case scenario? Also, if I were to buy from them, what sorts of things should I look out for? \n\nIf you have REAL experience of buying a rental OR know someone who has Id love to know. I need a car ASAP &amp; I know itll be Tesla, but ideally it can be within a good price range. \n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all the great feedback. Overall it seems most people are apprehensive about buying a rental (for good reason). Some reasons being the battery life, suspension, and interior abuse. For rental purchases people have recommend a LFM battery over a NCM as it withstands more damage to the battery from constant supercharging to 100%. \n\nOn the flip side though, everyone who has commented &amp; actually purchased a rental buy from Hertz hasnt had any major issues, &amp; overall seem happy (: so i think if i find a good car, even if from Hertz, ill give it a go.

      "title": "Tesla Model 3 Winter Range - My Experience",
      "text": "A frequent question in this forum is about range in winter, so I wanted to share some of my data that I have accumulated over the past 4.5 years with my 2018 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD (pre-heat pump), living near Minneapolis, MN. It\u0019s not quite Canadian weather here, but I feel I can be a pretty good barometer for colder climates.\n\nFirst, a little background on the data I collect. I have been trying my hardest to take a picture of my odometer and clear my trip meter on the first of every month. I then enter the data into an Excel spreadsheet with some accompanying data like the average gas price, electricity cost, and temperature stats for that month. This gives me some good long-term stats and a great graph to back up my temperature related observations.\n\n[Graph from tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/whef6z9ytzma1.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de267d66d3ef4e63bff8c9a01fac9a428bee6bb9)\n\nLet me first dismiss the common misconception that in winter, \u001cyou can automatically expect a 30%-40% range loss.\u001d Sure, you can have a drive here or there where the range loss is bad, but when you look at the averages for an ***entire month***, you will see in my graph that the only times I ***ever*** got that low was during the 2019 POLAR VORTEX weather event. Let me remind everyone those two months it was abnormally cold where at one point the actual air temp got down to -27° F and stayed there for almost a week.\n\n[My tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/52ap5jyfuzma1.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95dd0f1a39b9307eb4356bc6e5b1e0aec6c2d61d)\n\nBack to the spreadsheet data, if you calculate the range loss from NOV through MAR for the last 5 winters combined, it averages to a -17.53% loss. (Not so bad considering the average internal combustion engine typically drops between [\\-15%-24% in the winter too](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/coldweather.shtml).)\n\nHere is another interesting observation from my spreadsheet. According to the EPA\u0019s web site, my Model 3 has a blended rating of 290 Wh/mi (29kWh/100 mi). Much to my surprise, the spreadsheet\u0019s calculations back that up with 290.03 Wh/mi over the life of my vehicle.\n\nDigging into the graph a bit more, each blue dot on the graph is the average monthly temperature versus the average watt hours per mi achieved during each month. You will see that I also added a green EPA rating line at 290, a blue 32° F freezing line, and a purple trendline for the blue dots. \n\nThe purple trendline crosses the EPA rating at right about 43° F. This means the when the average temp for the month is over 43° F, that I usually got ***better*** than the EPA rating. When the temp is under 43° F, my Wh/mi was typically in the 300-350 range, I assume because I only have the PTC resistance heater and no heat pump. What I have noticed anecdotally, is that when the temperature is between 65°-75° F, that is the sweet spot for efficiency. For August 2019, called out on the graph, I had a 17.24% ***gain*** in range with nice weather.\n\nIn conclusion, having 30%-40% loss during a ***single trip*** indeed happens, but that drastic of a loss for an ***entire month*** would likely only happen due to some unprecedented weather conditions (think Polar Vortex). \n\nWhen people ask about my range loss in the winter, I am quick to point out that my personal experience is \"actually pretty close to the winter gas mileage losses in my old Toyota Camry.\" Practically speaking, when doing road trips to ND to visit my in-laws in the winter, we usually have to sit at the supercharger for an extra few minutes, but it really isn\u0019t much of a bother.",

She got me one of the 2021 LPF battery models and I had to finish processing all the financial documents within 5 days or risk losing the booking! Got a 1.24% APR following the DCU hack on reddit too. I commute 120+ every two weeks to work, so was in desperate need for a efficient vehicle and the TM3 was a no brainer. I am new to the world of EV, so I was wondering if someone can help answer a few questions I have:  \n\n\n**About the CAR:**\n\n* Since this is an LPF battery, I assume I can charge it to 100% every time at home. But couldn't find any official documentation on this online. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1431040308943364097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1431040308943364097%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-model-3-lfp-battery-explains-elon-musk%2F) from Elon sort of maybe says that it's ok to charge to 100% every time- but I want to be extra careful. Also, [in this other tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1118225459416682496?lang=en) Elon says it's better to charge to 90-95% to take full advantage of regen. What would be your recommendation for the LPF pack? Anyone has a link to anything official on the Tesla website?\n* I will be charging from a 10-30 NEMA adapter hooked to my dryer port which I recently purchased from the Tesla shop. Conveniently, the dryer is in my small two car garage in my condo :D  Do you guys also recommend getting a 14-50 NEMA for travel? What about an extension chord recommendation for cases where the 240v port is further away? I have been seeing all sorts of chord recommendations online. What sort of adapters/plugs/converters etc should a TM3 user carry in the trunk/frunk?\n* What is the best way to prevent \"Vampire charge drain\" at home? After seeing about 3-5% of my battery charge drain overnight, so far I have done the following: 1) Set \"sentry mode\" to turn off at home and work , 2) Turned off wifi at home , 3) Turned off cabin overheat protection\n* What is the absolute best set of floor mats for the TM3? Would you recommend the Tesla store ones or just something from a 3rd party? \n* Do you have glass tinting recommendation (% tins, type of layers etc)? Does that void the Tesla warranty by any means?  \n\n\n**About EV incentives:**\n\n* If anyone here is a Southern California Edison customer- do you recommend switching over to the TouD/TouD Prime plan? Which TouD plan would you recommend?\n* Will the $7000 \"Green Deal\" credit be \"retroactive\" to 2021 cars? There's no solid information about this bill online- but my gut feeling says it will definitely pass by next year. What is the chance of getting this credit applied to my tax filing next year, if any? I wanted to delay getting the car- but I really needed something for my long commute. \n* Any other EV incentive anyone else recommend- especially for CA residents? I already got the $1500 clean air rebate during purchase\n\nMuchas gracias in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvuk1b3euxo71.jpg?width=1616&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42833d2ab773aece0faaad4fc74171b4b18dbe7",

      "text": "Hi guys, I got my new Model 3 LR RWD two weeks ago and I've beeing loving the car so far, but it's my first Tesla so I have some questions regarding the charging process.\n\nI drive around 15 miles every day, very little, so using the mobile connector on the regular outlet is being enough for me since I'm able to charge every night til 80%. And because of that, here are my questions:\n\n1. Regardless of how much battery I use, I usually get home around 5:15pm, plug it in the outlet and let there charging until around 8:45 in the next morning. Sometimes I reach 80% around 2am, sometimes 6am, depending on how much I used the previous day, but I always leave it plugged until I leave, which happens around 8:45am. Is there any harm on doing that?\n2. Is there a problem on using only the mobile connector in a regular outlet to charge my Tesla?\n3. If I get home with around 75% of battery, is it okay to always plug it in and leave there until next morning or since I would still have plenty of charge, should I leave the car unplugged and keep using it until I reach a lower level of battery?\n\n  \nPS.: I live in an apartment, so I rent one of those garages they have and I don't have to pay for the electricity there, just the rent.\n\nThank you so much!!",

Basically all the other options used would mean getting a year 1 or year 2 vehicle and that made me kinda nervous on the used front.\n\nAnyway, since the best deal I found was actually from Tesla's website I'm curious if there's a solid list anywhere of what to check for on delivery day.

Neither the Inside Delivery Advisor nor the Sales Adviser I dealt with have provided any assistance on resolving this matter. Documentation has been provided that clearly shows we are owed a refund. However, neither representative appear to be knowledgeable - or perhaps they don't care. The inability to speak with a knowledgeable Tesla representative is extremely frustrating. Nearly all communication has to transpire via email with very indecisive replies.\n\nThere is a distinct dichotomy between the car itself and the support received on the backend of a purchase. On one hand, the M3 is a beautiful all-electric vehicle loaded with a tremendous amount of technology. It is by far the best auto that I have ever driven. However, on the other hand the customer support has been extremely disappointing. The top Google search results of \"Tesla complaints\" revolve around the inability to speak to anyone directly on the phone and the don't care attitude that is pervasive within the organization. I truly hope we did not just spend over $65,000 on a car that I will regret down the road.\n\nIt\u0019s not that I desperately need reimbursement of the $4,412.50 we are owed this very moment. However, it is extremely frustrating there is no acceptance on Tesla\u0019s part that we are indeed due the overpayment amount. Given our experience on dealing with this side of the purchase gives us great hesitation on recommending a friend or family member to consider purchasing a Tesla vehicle.\n\nI read in another post that I should go to my Tesla account and submit a support ticket that should be escalated to the executive level. However, I have yet to receive a response. Has anyone else experienced such an issue that can provide advise on how I get this resolved? Any advise is much appreciated!",

      "text": "I drive around 160 miles roundtrip 3-4 days a week to work and I'm looking to buy an EV that can handle that commute but within the best price range. Im thinking of getting a Chevrolet Bolt EV or EUV because they are the cheapest option and have around 250 miles they can go on one charge, but curious how long they will last for?\n\n I want something for the long term and will last. I'm not sure if anyone has experienced a Chevy Bolt lasting 200,000 plus miles because that's kinda what I'm trying to go for without needing to replace the battery. If the Bolt can maybe do that it would be awesome.\n\nI'm also looking at maybe something that can fast charge quick if emergencies happen. I like the Chevy Bolt because I can easily charge it from home on a level 2 charge and it should be good the next day but one thing i don't like is the fast charge is not as fast compared to other EVs out there. \n\nIm also looking for an EV that won't be expensive on my electricity bill at home since I'm going EV to save money both now and in the long run.\n\nAlso looking for an EV that will qualify for the recent 7500$ tax refund for vehicles made in the US. I saw the list and for what I'm looking for and what I need for my commute not many cars fit.\n\nThe only ones I saw were the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV and the Tesla model 3. I like the model 3 but I dont know if I really want to pay 40K+ for a car and I heard insurance is high for a Tesla. At the same time I've heard Tesla is great for long commuters and batteries last hundreds of thousands of miles.\n\nJust need help and want some opinions",

      "text": "So far I've had the car a week and 2 separate issues that are killing my enjoyment.  While the 1st one resolved it self overnight, this one has been ongoing for about 4 days now.  I've already scheduled a service appt but want to know if anyone has found the fix for this issue so it doesn't take them multiple appointments or a long stay at the service center as I want to enjoy my car.\n\nSo randomly on Thursday afternoon I noticed my audio was lacking ALL bass, looked into the EQ settings, surround settings, etc... and nothing would bring it back, was driving so figured I'd look more at home.  Once I got home I found that the front speakers are mostly working minus the door woofers and a-pillar tweeters, however none of the rear speakers work, at least properly.  Attached is a video of that portion of the issue: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCLxvdKJQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCLxvdKJQA) notice, balance is set to rear ONLY and it cuts out every second, this happens with normal balance as well just harder to hear since the audio fills from the front of the vehicle properly.  This also affects the microphone in the same way, my voice will cut out during commands or during phone calls just like the audio from the speakers.\n\nDigging in to this issue more I've found maybe 10 different threads that have explained this issue but none of them have talked about resolution, they just stop updating the post. I've narrowed it down to the A2B wire that feeds audio data to the rear trunk Amplifier then that decodes the data and feeds it to the all of the premium audio speakers + the trunk subwoofer.  Pulling back the trunk liner, I can see the amp has a flashing amber light when the A2B connector is plugged in, if i unplug that connector, no more flashing, just solid orange and the microphone works, but obviously no premium audio functions either.\n\nI'm assuming this is either a bad AMP (unlikely as others have tried replacing just the amp and have had no luck) or a problem with the MCU where the primary AMP is what sends the A2B signal to the rear AMP.  Either way, anyone have this issue and have it solved that I can reference when service looks at the car so it I don't have to sit with this issue for weeks/months while they go through their guesses of what will fix it?\n\nLastly, I've tried 10+ soft scroll wheel resets with different circumstances and I've also done a full 12V disconnect hard reset to no avail.  I've also unplugged all of the connectors and replugged them in to ensure they're snug along with the subwoofer connector to ensure nothing was loose, no help.\n\nThanks for any help anyone can offer!\n\nHere's some links to existing posts of the same issue:\n\n[https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/lost-bass-speakers-and-rear-channels-i-only-get-a-cyclic-thump.143298/page-2\n](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/lost-bass-speakers-and-rear-channels-i-only-get-a-cyclic-thump.143298/page-2)\n\n[https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/rear-speakers-and-subwoofer-no-longer-working-after-service.182069/\n](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/rear-speakers-and-subwoofer-no-longer-working-after-service.182069/)\n\n[https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/rear-amp-issues-with-rear-speakers-and-a2b-connector.207905/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/rear-amp-issues-with-rear-speakers-and-a2b-connector.207905/)\n\n[https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/rear-speakers-and-sub-not-working-after-body-work.200374/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/rear-speakers-and-sub-not-working-after-body-work.200374/)\n\n[https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/154818/rear-speakers-not-working-this-morning?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_lzKMvTYldOIQRIr76bBBUsiWzyyHjrkbum_rgNqMRb0-1630946270-0-gqNtZGzNAlCjcnBszQtR](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/154818/rear-speakers-not-working-this-morning?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_lzKMvTYldOIQRIr76bBBUsiWzyyHjrkbum_rgNqMRb0-1630946270-0-gqNtZGzNAlCjcnBszQtR)",

When friends and family members would ask me what car I was thinking about getting, they were skeptical and concerned about not buying a brand that has been around very long, the future of electric vehicles, and the future of Tesla.\n     Recently I talked to an acquaintance who reviews cars as a profession, and in short his thoughts were that Tesla\u0019s were inferior cars, cheaply built, and likely to end in disappointment because of their expectations and their being a likelyhood of unfulfilled promises. In short he basically stated that he thought my plan of getting a Tesla was not a good idea at all.\n     I\u0019m left in a tough spot because from all the research I\u0019ve done, the Tesla Model 3 looks like a great car and the owners are genuinely very happy with the car, but most of the people I\u0019ve talked to are telling me purchasing the car would be a mistake.\n     For anyone that has a model 3 could you please give me your honest opinion of the car and spare no details, and let me know if you had the opportunity to redo your decision if you would still choose the model 3.\n\nThanks",

I just want to make sure it's cool with you guys that I'm plugging that in, instead of an RV. And she was just blown away by that and three or four times she said to me, you plug your car in? Yes, I plug my car in. Is that okay with you? She's like, yeah, I guess it's fine. How much energy does it take? I was like, well, it still is gonna plug into the same 50 amp connection that a RV would, so it's not gonna be any more than that. And she's like, okay, yeah, that's fine.

      "text": "I have a new job opportunity upcoming that I think I'm going to accept, and this opportunity will require me to buy a car.  I have had a company owned Ford Escape for the past 6 years but the new position does not offer a company car.\n\nMy decision is coming down to the Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus or the new Toyota RAV4 XSE Hybrid.  The cost of the vehicles is a wash, although the RAV4 would cost another $100 or so a month for gas at current prices.  I expect to be driving 18,000 miles a year if I take this new position, the vast majority of which will be highway miles.  \n\nI really want to go with the Tesla, I already have Tesla solar panels on my house and I highly value the green nature of electric driving, not to mention Autopilot for all those highway miles I would be driving.\n\nThe thing that scares me is the amount of room in the vehicle.  I would prefer the Model Y, but seeing as that won't be available for another couple years the Model 3 is my only Tesla option.  There is a local Tesla store and I did take one for a test ride, however I couldn't put any car seats or strollers or anything else our family hauls around with us.  Right now it's my wife, my two year old daughter, and I.  We are currently trying for another kid so eventually there will be 4 of us.\n\nSo my question is, does the Model 3 work as a family car?",

Traded in my 14 VW GLI and privately sold my 08 Ram 2500 Mega Cab Cummins for a hefty down payment. The car was perfect, and the process was 30 mins to drive it off the lot. The ride back to my place in Virginia Beach was quick and experienced my first \u001cPhantom Brake\u001d on the highway. I was going down a ramp and the road took a long dip and I guess the Autopilot thought it ran out of road, so it almost locked on the breaks. Kind of worried me a bit and initially didn\u0019t know what to do. After that I had no problems.\n\nHired an electrician to install a lvl. 2 charger set up for the garage. TIP- DON\u0019T SAY ITS FOR An EV!!! THEY WILL PRICE HIKE YOU! I paid 1100 for the setup because I don\u0019t enjoy messing with electricity (not my profession). After a couple of other vehicle accessories (phone mount, trays for storage, and front end PPF) the total came out to 3500 dollars. Initial accessories where steep IMO.\n\nI LOVE THIS CAR! It is a balanced super quick car! It creates driver confidence, and you feel like to you can do anything with this car. The over the air updates the car gets are makes the car better the longer I\u0019ve had it. The phantom breaking, I think is almost not there anymore and the wipers have gotten better with each update. Loving the auto off turn signals addition and the Apple Music is a plus.\n\nThere are a few of what I call \u001cTesla quirkiness\u001d that I have learned to live with. When it rains the driver's side window squeaks. If you move the front seat headrests up the plastic cover in the back falls down. There have been a couple of squeaks and rattles that came and went over the year. \n\nMy wife owns a 22 Lincoln Aviator Black Label and now she has been driving my Tesla for over a month now because she has the longer drive. She is learning the ins and outs of the tech, but she still bitches and complains about a few things. She says she loves to go fast. Waiting for her to get a ticket.\n\nMaintenance has been almost nonexistent. I have spent 70 dollars on two tire rotations and 15 dollars on wiper fluid. 200 deductible on a cracked windshield. According to the Tesla App, it says that I have spent $800 on electric charge (saved $1950). Charge at home all the time.\n\nI love this car and would recommend this to anybody out there!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vy0w2uffsma1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5d597db63635f1a41d255c52dda92d3b197f6f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgyne2uffsma1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce1db1c6c5cd944ccefbaca5dec3ee751f3f385",

      "text": "Have a 2020 SR (not plus).  Since i bought it my only real complaint was the total lack of low end.  Figured it would be simple to install a small electrical component in an electric car.  ICE vehicles have always been straight forward, and aside from fighting to get the power wire through the firewall they are mostly drama free.\n\nStarted reading about the M3 and discovered its by no means just a simple plug and play endeavor.\n\nModel 3s front battery is highly monitored and any arrant activity (such as, you know, an amplifier) on the battery can make the car think the battery is bad and cause it to disable the car.\n\nThe solution to the battery is the Penthouse (DC-DC) connector. Its good for about 200 amps, and its conveniently located under the rear seat:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7sn9kbf1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b407e396576553defa054cf98855d8a1fa9a2d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prjg7ef1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8407077a93f803537064454afa852ae2e7c99e3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isnt the end of the road though.   The car can entirely shut the penthouse down, taking all 12V away from the system.  This is akin to plugging and unplugging the 12v battery on an ICE vehicle.  When you first connect an amp, youll notice a spark.  This is in rush current charging the caps in the amp.   Youll see this once only in ICE, but with the Tesla, it can happen every single time the penthouse shuts down.  If the computer notices this inrush, it can throw the car into protect and youll get all kinds of errors and will be undrivable until you do a hard restart.\n\nThe solution here is to add a 200 amp relay + a 100w 5 ohm resistor.  Power slowly flows through the resistor to charge the caps preventing in rush and then the relay switches to using standard power.  No errors.\n\nNot pictured is 12v switched.   Model 3 has no regular 12v switched so we have to think outside the box.  Im using a solid state relay, Its grabbing 12v constant from the light blue wire in the drivers kick panel for the 12v outlet in the center console, and then its using 12v switched from the center console light.  This wire isnt strong enough to run the remote by itself, thus the relay.  12v turns on when the door opens, 12v turns off when you get out of the drivers seat and close the door (basically  the behavior you want, on when you are in the car, off when you arent)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/momxuvf1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f92cb462b76c09a8e8fe315c4046d520cdecce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ul53ef1qpza1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ca1aac6a8be32e04732408702ec16dd149d64b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lgp9gf1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d301a256a6c9bfeff919f388f9415743921e2f1e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q650zf1qpza1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23f7bbf85cbfb27f5b8cd3abe18696482b16c5cb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z7tczf1qpza1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0cf6647c7331ddc53539d3ba0b89fd87a98f6eb\n\nHere is a wiring diagram i created to digest it all.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxi26a39z5db1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25b359afd0ecddfd322d38d66b9868f39e81420\n\nThe brown wire in the center console is hidden behind the rear hvac vent, there are two sets of wires back there:  one for the usb ports, and the other for the light sensor for the light inside the center console.  Thats the one you need.  Looks like this image.  I attached to the black wire on the other side of the clip as its thicker gauge and easier to reach.

      "title": "My experience charging at home with a standard 20A garage outlet",
      "text": "TL:DR - Almost got a NEMA 14-50 outlet, but glad I stayed with a standard 20A outlet instead.\n\nI purchased my Model 3 LR on May 27, 2020 and picked up on June 1, 2020.  What an amazing experience.  The car has been a dream to own and drive.  I got the FSD package, and while I was not in the beta for FSD, I absolutely love it.  Now to get on to the topic of the post.\n\nWhen I purchased the car, I set up an appointment for a NEMA 14-50 outlet to be added to my garage.  It was to be put about 1 foot away from the breaker box, and there were no other upgrades needed.  The electrical company I chose was charging $750 for the install.  I was not too concerned with the price since my local electric company was giving me a $1000 rebate for purchasing an electric vehicle.  Unfortunately (or fortunately in my case), the company could not complete the install until June 20.  So I would be a few weeks charging from a standard outlet (20A) already installed in my garage.\n\nDuring the wait period, I purchased a Y-cable for my dryer outlet (NEMA 10-30) from Amazon for $50.  I thought I may need more charge, since my dryer outlet was just inside my garage door, I could easily run the cable if needed and not have to unplug the dryer each time.\n\nNow, since COVID, like many others, I do not drive as much as I used to.  I live about 5 miles from work and frequently take trips to the beach (20m round trip) and around town.  With COVID, some of this changed, but I still found myself driving a bit more because I loved driving the car.  After the first week, I realized I did not need the NEMA 14-50 outlet because the standard outlet in the garage was keeping up with my consumption.  I cancelled the installation of the outlet saving me the $750.\n\nI only have 7850 miles on the car now, but have been exceptionally satisfied with my 6 miles/hr charge.  When I look back, the charging is good for 98%+ of my daily usage.  I keep the car at 80% charge, and have only used the dryer outlet twice.  Once to boost to 100% overnight (I may not have needed it) for a 1000 mile trip to Indiana, and the other time because I had gone down to &lt;20% after a day trip to Daytona (I live in North Florida) and I didn't want to wait 48+ hours for it to get back to 80%.  \n\nOverall, I have been very happy plugging in to my standard outlet in the garage and even more happy I saved the $750 for the outlet.  To note - I do have a supercharger 2 miles from my house, but only used it once to see what supercharging was like before a trip.  For most of my driving, the standard outlet has been perfect.  When I travel (have made 4 long trips), I use the supercharger network and it is amazing.  So for anyone questioning their charging, I would highly recommend weighing the option to do a standard outlet, or even a dryer outlet, before spending the money for a NEMA 14-50.  In my opinion, if you drive less than 50 miles a day, I don't think the additional cost is worth it.",

      "text": "Hello, looking for your best tips on reducing energy loss while being parked. I recently lost +5% in a matter of 2-3 hours while parked in the inclosed parking structure at my work.\n\nBreaking down the +5% loss. Vehicle standby contributed +3%, while mobile app contributed 1.6%. Both sentry mode and cabin overheat protection were off. Sentry mode was off per exclude work. I checked before leaving the car to make sure sentry mode was off, and it was. I left the motion recording and live app view settings on as they typically are since sentry mode was overall supposed to be off based on the location exclusion.\n\nSome other notes. Temp should not be an issue for the battery since the garage temp typically is about 70 degrees F with no material changes. \n\nI never checked the app once, so I am not sure why I show so much usage from the app. I have all the settings switched on for the app on my iPhone, including background refresh, so I am wondering if it is something like that. Should that be off? I have read that phone key should still work normally even with that off but have not tested that yet. I\u0019m assuming closing the app is obviously a no go. App is also set for \u001calways\u001d on location. At work, I do not sit anywhere close to where the car is parked\u0014let\u0019s call it .2-3 miles away. I don\u0019t have any third party apps and don\u0019t use any of the widgets.\n\nLastly, for vehicle standby usage, I don\u0019t use summon or have it activated. Not sure why this used as much energy as it did. The amount of usage makes me think that maybe the car is not going to sleep as it should be, but maybe I am wrong. Please let me know what you all think. Thank you in advance. ",

      "text": "Hi, I have a 2019 Model 3 SR+ which means I have 6 unactivated speakers. I am not a big car audio guy but with the speaker hardware present, I really would like to get these turned on. Both [Tesla Offer](https://www.teslaoffer.com/product/model-3-sr-inactive-speaker-activation-wire-harness/)  and [Hannshow](https://www.hautopart.com/product/model3-sr-premium-audio-upgrade/) sell a variety of kits to accomplish this. They range from a \\~$80 harness and cable kit to $1000 kits with a subwoofer, amp, DSP and extra speakers. I am really only interested in the cheapest version (which they label the DIY option).   \nDoes anyone have experience with either kit? I've watched a lot of videos of the install and a few things stand out.\n\n1. It seems like with the Hannshow kit, you have to run wires from the passenger side to the driver side, under the center console. This actually seems like a big pain to do. According to an updated (Sept 2020?) install video, Tesla Offer's version seems to keep all wiring on the passenger side only. I am not sure how this is accomplished if true since I think you need to plug into the driver side tweeter and side view mirror speaker.\n2. It seems like Hannshow sold kits with miswired  connectors causing the rear speakers to be swapped. The fix is easy, but annoying - you have to remove four pins and change their order. Does anyone know if Hannshow has since corrected the wiring?\n3. Does anyone see any cons to getting just the activation cable and not a DSP, amp, etc?  Are there any chances of blown fuses or electrical issues. I am not concerned about bass so no sub needed.\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "According to a report by Bloomberg on January 24, Tesla\u0019s California factory will become the most productive auto factory in North America in 2021, beating more than 70 other competing factories. Tesla\u0019s Fremont, Calif., plant will produce an average of 8,550 vehicles per week in 2021, ahead of Toyota\u0019s Kentucky plant of 8,427 and BMW\u0019s South Carolina plant of 8,343.\n\nTesla's Fremont, California factory was originally built by General Motors in the 1960s. It was affiliated with General Motors from 1962 to 1982 and Toyota from 1984 to 2009. In 2010, Tesla acquired the plant and carried out a large-scale upgrade. In June 2012, the first Model S made by Tesla rolled off the production line at this plant. Before the Shanghai plant was put into production, the Fremont plant had been Tesla's only complete vehicle plant.\n\nTesla\u0019s Fremont, California factory currently covers an area of \u000b\u000b5.3 million square feet, while the Texas factory that will be mass-produced reaches 7.9 million square feet. The area of \u000b\u000bthe Texas factory exceeds that of the California factory, Shanghai factory, and Berlin factory. The largest known factory in the area. Now Tesla headquarters has moved from California to Texas.\n\n**The current major auto plants in North America:**\n\nToyota Kentucky plant, 9 million square feet, producing 8,427 new vehicles per week.\n\nTesla's Texas plant, 7.9 million square feet, will start production in 2022.\n\nBMW South Carolina plant, 7 million square feet, producing 8,343 new cars per week.\n\nNissan's Tennessee plant, 6 million square feet, produces about 4,900 new vehicles per week.\n\nTesla\u0019s California factory, 5.3 million square feet, produces 8,550 new cars per week.\n\nStlantis Michigan plant, 5 million square feet, produces about 6,000 new vehicles per week.\n\nFord's Missouri plant, 4.7 million square feet, produces about 5,800 new vehicles per week.\n\nThe Hyundai-Kia Indiana plant, 3.4 million square feet, produces about 5,600 new cars per week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough Tesla has an absolute leader in the field of pure electric vehicles, the output ratio of other brands is still far behind. In 2021, Tesla's U.S. factories will only be ranked 10th in productivity.\n\nAfter the Texas factory is put into operation in 2022, there may be an opportunity to push the ranking up, but there is little hope. The real capacity growth will have to wait until 2023 when the Texas factory is fully released.",

      "text": "Hey Guys, I recently crossed over the 30k mile mark after 173 days with my 2023 RWD Model 3. I just wanted to post mainly to update on Battery Health as I did another check, which I originally did around 15k miles I believe.\n\nAfter 3 months and 15k miles, I ran a battery health check and it was rated at 93%. The first month of ownership was solely Supercharging, and I thought that my battery might actually be an issue because there is no way that 7% drop in health seemed reasonable.\n\nAs of the 30k miles mark, I ran another battery check, and the health stayed at 93%. I wonder if this has something to do with the LFP battery, maybe the supercharging for 40KW per day for a month straight actually did damage it. All I know is I currently supercharge roughly 100KW per month, where I Level2 Charge at home the other 1000KW.\n\nOverall, its a great commuter car. I envy those who don't see an issue with traveling long distances with this car and don't mind the constant pulling over to charge (because I love driving it). I took the car once from Indy to Detroit, a 280 mile, 4h15m drive. I was asked by Tesla to charge twice on the way, in Fort Wayne and Toledo. The FW charge was 10 min out of my way, however the Toledo charger was directly on my exit. Being preconditioned and charging the minimum to move on, my drive took 5h25m total. And to add to the fact that Supercharging costs almost gas price equivalent, now I'm just wasting time. Also, I had no Lv2 in Detroit, so another stop there before heading back. It's just an inconvenience in Time that I do not want to sacrifice.\n\nPersonally I believe the Electric Car is made for the everyday commuter around the city, short trips. If you aren't charging at home 99% of the time, then you aren't getting anywhere close to the savings you expected to have when purchasing the car. If you purchased the car because you WANTED it, then it was a luxury purchase for yourself, and good for you because they are great vehicles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR. I love the car. Electric cars are made for the everyday commuter. If you aren't charging at home, then your electric car purchase was a luxury purchase for yourself, not a cost savings one.",

      "text": "I updated my 2020 model 3 last night to the newest software. Went to take a drive today around 2pm and got a myriad of electrical issues, car would not drive. One of which was \u001cPlease wait while high power voltage system powers up to drive.\u001d Followed by a lot of technical, car shut down this and that feature due to battery. \n\nOkay I guess understand maybe something happened last night that drew out power from an already older 12v battery in place. It\u0019s a 2020 I bought last month, likely that small battery is end of life. Likely the update may have caused something for it to terminate. I get that.\n\nMobile service earliest is Monday the 20th.. called local service center, they said bring it in and they will look at it (I can do that the car won\u0019t drive). Now I\u0019m stranded the next 3 days I work (Thurs, Fri, Sat) with no hope from them to rectify what happened. \n\nHere\u0019s the kicker. Last nights update had something to do with the windows or maybe it\u0019s a low 12v feature idk. But it\u0019s raining here.. and when I got in to diagnose it, the car automatically rolled the window down all the way once I opened the door. To make things worse it would not roll up after I got in, nor could I get it up in any other fashion. I had to jump it with my wife\u0019s car to enable it to go back up. I got out out of the car with the jumpers still attached, it rolled all the way down again. \n\nMy solution was to have the window all the way down, then hit the roll up window function outside of the car and quickly retract my hand out. Which was fine until I looked at the other windows&\n\nIs this real life? Is this a fluke or something I should expect?",

I\u0019ve been a long time Tesla fanboy and my only real regret is that I didn\u0019t buy one sooner (or buy more Tesla stock). \n\nIn one month I\u0019ve driven about 1,000 miles in the SR+, supercharged, charged at home, and just all around loved my vehicle. A few days ago my newborn son got to take his very first ride in a car ever when we left the hospital and he did it in our beautiful white Model 3. \n\nPros of the car: no range anxiety, comfortable ride, lots of fun little tricks, easy to charge, and it\u0019s a great drive. Charging at our rental house with the mobile charger has been super easy. Had a door and a trunk out of alignment when I picked it up, but had no trouble getting a mobile service appointment. The tech fixed me up in no time. Separately had some minor software issues with the MCU and they were able to get those worked out remotely.\n\nThe car is a head turner and I\u0019m so proud to drive it. \n\nCons: a few minor build/paint quality issues but no biggie. The car is soooo quiet I\u0019ve had to get used to a little more road noise. Just means I turn the music up a little louder! I also don\u0019t love that there\u0019s no spare tire so I\u0019ll be getting a patch/plug kit and a mobile air pump soon. Biggest complaint: no SiriusXM. My commute (as well as weekend adventures) take me through areas with no or limited cell service and I sure would love to have unimpeded access to my stations on Sirius. Also, the automatic wipers are very hit and miss. \n\nOther items: I didn\u0019t buy FSD. Honestly, when the free trial expires the only aspect that\u0019s functional right now that I\u0019ll really miss is Summon. I wish there was a way to purchase that feature a la carte. Also would love to have a heated steering wheel, but can\u0019t have everything. I also wish there was a better way to manage charge by time, timing commence, and all those sorts of things. I\u0019d like to be able to set the car to start charging at midnight, be ready to leave by 7:15 on weekdays, and then ready to depart work at 4:20 on weekdays. Maybe they\u0019ll get there with that someday. \n\nHoping to get my wife into a Model Y in the next year or two. 9/10 would buy the Model 3 again.",

      "text": "Currently it is 11 degrees F outside and of course all vehicles are affected by the cold. if slow blocks the radiators in an ice vehicle, it can overheat. ice vehicles can have a hard time starting in the cold and need to be warmed up for longer, its bad for the batteries used to start the engine, etc. \n\nbut ev's although they dont have any of these issues with getting running, the batteries need to remain at a healthy temperature which may mean your car looses charge just sitting not being used. not just because the cold reduces effective range, but also the car needing to keep the battery at a healthy temp even when not being used, will supposedly trickle down your battery.\n\nSo how much range do you loose every day the car sits not plugged in? say you leave for a month, with a full charge in the winter. will you be able to come back and have a decent charge or would you run the genuine risk of the battery loosing a significant amount of charge? This seems to be the main reason that keeps ev's from being good in rural areas. If ev's have small solar panels that can supply enough power to keep the battery at a healthy temperature, then this could solve some of this. maybe even have heating coils in the panel to melt slow and ice on contact to avoid the panel being covered.",

During Summer, we\u0019re likely to roadtrip around the country too. \n\nWe can charge easily around, at home and at her parents home. \n\nFrom my perspective, I\u0019m very excited about a few things regarding this upgrade: \n- No more manual gears and true one pedal driving in most situations\n- Limited sounds from the vehicle and better sound insulation, especially on highways. \n- Lowering our carbon footprint by reducing our carbon emissions. Portugal has a lot of renewable energy too, so our electricity is more and more likely to come from those renewable sources. \n- Driving assistance, as our Fiesta has no cruise mode, making long distance trips very tiring. \n\nMy wife is mostly excited about the increased comfort and the bigger trunk, especially to carry the baby stuff.\n\nI\u0019m pretty convinced this is a good upgrade but after reading posts here, I\u0019m starting to doubt a bit.. I evaluated some other cars but none attracted me as much as the Model 3. Plus the leasing is pretty attractive to us financially.\n\nI\u0019d love some honest owners thoughts on this decision!

      "title": "Dual Charging EVSE Review",
      "text": "Hey all! A couple months ago, I was looking for a dual charging solution for my two EVs and stumbled across the ClipperCreek HCS-D40P Plug-in Level 2 Dual Charging Station. No one had any experience with the product so I decided to write a review of it. Hope this is helpful if you\u0019re a two EV owner and need a solution like me !\n\n\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\n\nIn Q4 2019, my family went fully electric and added a second EV. The second EV introduced charging challenges. I thought we could share one NEMA 14-50 outlet by alternating charging cars every other day but due to long commutes, this wasn\u0019t possible.\nI needed a solution and wanted to leverage the NEMA 14-50 outlet in my garage; I was looking for a solution that:\n1. Allowed dual EV charging\n2. Was electrically safe and could automatically manage the power output to both cars\n3. Leveraged my existing charging infrastructure (NEMA 14-50 outlet)\n4. Could be portable \u0013 I could take it with me if I moved homes in the future (so I didn\u0019t have additional sunk costs)\n\nIntroducing the ClipperCreek HCS-D40P Plug-in Level 2 Dual Charging Station. This was the only solution that checked all the boxes for me and I was delighted, no thrilled, to find it. It\u0019s a new product that launched in Nov 2019 at a price of $1,369. With the federal tax credit of 30% of an EVSE and any local EVSE rebates ($250 in the state I live in), this drops the price to about $700. Not bad, considering most EVSE single chargers run at a price of $600.\n \nUnboxing\nThe ClipperCreek HCS-D40P is packaged very well. Each of the components are wrapped with plastic, charging components with bubble wrap and additional cardboard when needed, to ensure safety from scratches/movement during shipment.\n\nMy Initial impression when I took out the unit; I was impressed. ClipperCreek has produced a high-quality product \u0013 all of the components, even the charging holders. It\u0019s the same level of quality I\u0019ve seen with ClipperCreek products at my workplace.\n\nInstallation\nInstallation is a breeze. All that\u0019s required is to mount the EVSE charger on the wall (with two screws) and plug it directly into the NEMA 14-50 outlet. Do know that the NEMA 14-50 plug only extends to a maximum of 12 inches in length; this is per regulation and you\u0019ll want to be aware of this before you install. Also, you\u0019ll need to make sure you drill into wood studs (or have appropriate wall anchors if you can\u0019t) and that\u0019s it. It only takes several minutes and your dual charging station is up and running.\n\nOne thing to mention, your NEMA 14-50 outlet may be upside down if you own a Nissan LEAF or a Tesla. That was the case for me. The grounding hole was on the top of my NEMA 14-50, not on the bottom like the ClipperCreek required. A simple rotation of the plug addresses this easily. If you\u0019re not comfortable doing that, do hire an electrician.\n\nThe only other aspect of installation is optional \u0013 if you want to install the two charger holders (included with the HCS-Dual) and the additional cable cradle accessory, it\u0019s two screws per unit.\n\nCharging\nCharging works perfectly. The ClipperCreek EVSE safely manages the power output depending on how many EVs you have plugged in. When I have one EV plugged in, the unit delivers a full 32A charge at 8kWh. When I plug in my second EV, the unit automatically halves the charge rate, to deliver 16A at 4kWh to both cars simultaneously. The HCS-DP seamlessly manages the power output in the background.\n\nThat\u0019s exactly what I wanted. I didn\u0019t want to worry about making sure my cars didn\u0019t charge at the same time and risk blowing a fuse or worse for my electrical panel if I had put in two NEMA 14-50s in my garage. The ClipperCreek charging station definitely delivers.\n\nThere\u0019s also three indicator lights on the unit, yellow/orange for power, red for fault and green for charging. The lights illuminate for the charging side you\u0019re using. Straightforward and very easy to understand.\n\nConclusion\nThe ClipperCreek HCS-D40P Plug-in L2 Dual Charging Station is exactly the product I was looking for. It checked every single box: charged two EVs, electrically safe and managed power output automatically, leveraged my existing electrical infrastructure and is portable. With both the federal tax credit and local EVSE rebates, the price is definitely affordable.\n\nIn summary, if you\u0019re a two EV household and are looking for a safe, reliable way to charge your cars, I fully recommend the HCS-D. I have great confidence in this unit to keep my Tesla Model 3 and Nissan LEAF safely charged for years to come.",

It\u0019s been charging fine for months. \n\nI\u0019ve learned a few things about electrical work after some DIY projects. I ended up looking at his work and found that he had installed a 14-50R to a 30A breaker with 10 gauge. When I plug in my Tesla, it routinely draws 32/32A (max). \n\nOne would think that this is not to spec, and that he should have used a 40A or 50A breaker with appropriate wiring to match the 14-50 receptacle. That said, the breaker has never tripped in the time I\u0019ve lived here. \n\nI approached the electrician about this, and he assured me everything is to spec and safe. I disagree but don\u0019t know if I\u0019m in the wrong. \n\nI do know that I can manually cap the charging on my car to 25A to be safe, but that\u0019s not what I paid for. \n\nAny thoughts ?",

But this is replaced with what I dub charging anxiety, or risk of people that don\u0019t understand what an EV is or being large headed, unplugging me during the day. \n\nIt is not a problem as I get notifications of charging stopped or interrupted but a issue when I have to go out to replug and don\u0019t want to damage someone\u0019s vehicle or unplug some who didn\u0019t unplug me to reconnect to the outlet for the remainder of the workday. I have considered a splitter for the outlet but block heaters pull 7amps as far as I\u0019ve read and the M3 can pull 12amps which would kill the party for everyone due to popping the breaker ( which I have no idea where it\u0019s located).\n\nLooking for thoughts, opinions, resolutions that are not busting someone on sentry reporting them and becoming some elitists due to having an EV.",

So, I currently do all my own work to any cars I have, oil, brakes, replacing alternators, water pumps that sort of thing. I do not trust shops whatsoever. \n\nI love everything I can see about the model3. and am really excited about the lack of so many moving parts that make a regular car have the ability to break down., lack of things like water pumps, injectors, fuel pumps, etc in theory should make the car vastly more dependable. But the tradeoff is, IF the Tesla did have a problem at least electrical, its highly unlikely I'd be able to fix it. (I'd of course handle things like headlights, tire rotation etc myself) - So my questions are... in you guys real world experience, are there any common 'major' problems they have that could or have leave you stranded?\n\nI also do live in northern nevada, so it does get cold in the winter... my garage is pretty full, car would need to be outside pretty much, but could be plugged in. I'm told that other than a little loss of range in the cold, this wont permanently damage battery etc. has that been your experience?\n\nAnd the big one for me, is Id like to keep the car for a very very long time. My theory of the lack of moving parts leads me to think it should go well past 100k - does anyone have any real world high mileage on these without having any major repairs?\n\nThanks so much for thoughts! I'm excited about this, I just really want to be sure that I'm not signing up for some massive problem where I have to go to a dreaded shop haha.\n\n:)",

      "text": "The recent flooding in North Carolina led to the demise of my truck, and I think it\u0019s definitely time to switch to something more fuel efficient. Teslas have been on my radar for quite a while, and I am giving it strong consideration. I live in Western North Carolina, in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and I do a whole lot of driving both for adventures and work. I don\u0019t see as many Teslas here as I do pretty much anywhere else when I travel, and I\u0019m wondering if there\u0019s a good reason for that.\n\nDo any of you have experience with mountain life in a Tesla? In particular, it\u0019s important to me to be able to do (ideally) 250 - 300 miles without charging, so my long adventure days on the Blue Ridge Parkway etc. are still an option. I\u0019m also wondering about how it does on rough, rutty dirt roads, and if the clearance is an issue. I keep thinking I should buy a hybrid SUV, but my heart keeps going back to the Tesla. Not sure I can hold out for the Cybertruck.\n\nI think my funds will probably mean I have to do a used one, but it may depend on how the math works out. I\u0019m going to save a whole lot on gas, so my monthly budget is a lot higher than if I was buying a vehicle that needed fuel. \n\nWhat can you share with me to help me decide? I\u0019d also appreciate advice on where to buy. \n\nThank you!",

I understand that electric motors need to be in a sweet spot to be more efficient and likely a faster speed of rotation is better than a slower speed of rotation, but wouldn\u0019t a 2 speed transmission help efficiency at highway speeds? \n\n2) what is the sweet spot for electric motors? Is there a difference between the 2 motors in a model 3? Does this overcome the inefficiencies due to not having gears?\n\nIf I missed anything, or if there is anything definitive that I can read, please let me know. Google returns a myriad of garbage.",

Would have made six or seven using an ICE vehicle considering body breaks, groceries, etc. Longest detour to get to charger was about 10 minutes. Most of the chargers were directly enroute.  I often arrived below 10%.  Seems there's a SOC threshold below which Preconditioning won't occur. Initial charge rates were in the 130-150kW range with one exception at 70 kW (not sure why).   All in all not too inconvenient but you need put a bit of time into planning. \n\nAlso charged using camp site 115 V service at 12 A.  All had both standard and TT-30 plugs. Will buy tt-30 adapter for future trips as that should increase the charge current to 30A .  I've seen some for $30 on Amazon with good reviews.\n\nSubscribed to FSD for the trip, version 12.3.6. Had a one month free demo previously so my neural nets were trained already and I was comfortable letting it drive and knew when I might want to intervene. Used FSD for 2/3 of the distance which really made the driving more enjoyable. \n\n Driving was 50% four lane high ways and 50% 2 lane highways which had 80km / 50 mph speed limits. Most of the non-FSD driving was on two lane highways when it was worth passing cars....I'm more aggressive than most in that regard.  \n\nLove the car and it made the trip more enjoyable than prior trips in an ICE car or SUV. I can see the attraction of AWD LR from the range and even better acceleration...may be when our second car needs replacing.\n\n",

      "text": "Took my Tessie out camping last week in a town with no chargers in sight with the closest charger being over an hour away. \n\nCharged 100% on the closest supercharger which was slightly over 2 hours away and went on my way. Expecting to lose some charge while sitting idle for the week I turned everything off I could sentry, climate control etc.. which worked surprisingly well only went down a few percent over the course of the week. Mostly from getting in and out of the car and taking it around the small town we were in. \n\nCamping was great and start my trip back is where things got interesting.. had enough charge to make it to the closest charging station but not back to the closest supercharger. When I get to the town an hour away still had about 11% when I arrived to the charging station which was an electrify America charging station powered by APS a local electric company in Arizona. \n\nSo not realizing there is another type of charging system I pull out my adapter that came with the car only to realize it doesn\u0019t fit. After looking at the adapter a plastic piece seemed to be the only thing stopping it from connecting to the charger so the MacGyver in me decided to break it off as it appeared to not be doing much to begin with and shouldn\u0019t affect anything. Great news it fit like a charm and connected to the charger and began to initiate charging. So I lock up the car cross the street to get a bit to eat only to have my phone say charging unexpectedly stopped. \n\nWent back to mess with it and try a few more times before realizing I was wasting my time with trying to get it to work. Now I\u0019m at 11% my car is telling me if I went to the supercharger I would arrive at -16% battery. Feeling a little stranded I start to look for an outlet just to plug my car in. I did end up finding a hotel with a overnight charger luckily about 10 minutes up the road so pulled into there only to realize it was for guests only. Front desk lady was nice gave her $10 and she turned it on for me. Had to wait 2 hours to get another 14% and decided to take my chances heading to the supercharger. \n\nMade it with a few percent to spare and was able to charge up and make it home. Ended up turning a 3 hour drive (ice car) into over a 6 hour trip home but all in all the only thing hurt was my charging adapter which doesn\u0019t seem to affect anything still works as it should and my ego a little for not realizing there was another type of adapter. I did a bunch of research online only to realize I should probably already know these existed if I am driving an EV and ordered one that night. \n\nIt has arrived and I will store it in my trunk along with the original adapter just in case I ever find myself in the same predicament. So this is a fair warning to anybody else that may not know they exist to order one and keep it in the car as a backup because you may find yourself in a situation where you need it one day. \n\nTL;DR - didn\u0019t realize CCS adapter existed broke my original adapter to fit( doesn\u0019t charge don\u0019t try) ordered one to keep in car just in case.",

      "text": "Hello r/TeslaModel3 from Italy!\n\nI own a fantastic 2021 LR model 3 since last may that I deeply love, but I have started facing a weird headlight issue and service has not really helped much so far... I'm hoping someone here can provide some pointers!\n\n**TL;DR** Since mid October last year, the main beam of the front light on one side of the vehicle *sometimes* doesn't work. The rest of the lights on the same side (signature light, fog light, parking light, turning indicator) work as normal and the car does not show any warning or notification. When this happens, the light will not work even if I do a reset or a power off, but they will always self-heal if I plug in the charger for about one hour (it doesn't need to be charging, it's enough that it is plugged in). Also, here's the kicker, when the light doesn't work, if I run a light show, it will turn on correctly according to the light show schedule, but will be dead again as soon as it ends.\n\n**The long story**: since October, about once every 10 days (but this week happened twice in two days, so go figure), the right side inner and outer main beams will not work. Only the main inner and outer beams stop working, the other lights work just fine, and the car does not show any warning whatsoever. They never stopped while I was driving, but just don't turn on at all when I start the car. They might be fine when I start the car in the morning, and then not turn on when I start it to go back home. Pre-heating the cabin does not change anything.\n\nWhen the lights decide not to work, I can manually turn on / off them, turn off the car (I waited around five minutes before turning it back on) or reset the center console, but they will not come back to life. However, if I plug the charger and let it sit for an hour or so (even if it is not charging), the lights will always self-heal and work perfectly fine the next time I start the car. I have only used the mobile charger, there are no superchargers nearby, so I don't know if that would work as well.\n\nIf that's not strange enough, here is what I really can't explain: just to see if it made any difference, I created a custom light show that only switches on and off all the lights one by one, and *while the problem happens*, I can run the light show completely fine! The lights will turn on and off when its their turn, but as soon as the light show ends, the lights are dead again.\n\nI have been in contact with support since october, they have so far cancelled two appointments that I tried scheduling and decided instead to perform remote diagnosis. They have asked for pictures and videos of the issue, which I sent them (and I've since kept spamming them with a new picture every time the issue happened, just so that they don't forget about me). I guess they have no idea what's going on (and I can totally understand that, it makes absolutely no sense in my mind) and they might not want me to go there also because they know it's a 2+ hours drive to get to the service center, so I'd rather not go there just to hear that they didn't do anything because they didn't find anything wrong.\n\nCan anyone here help? I can't believe I am the only one having this issue! Thank you.",

      "text": "TLDR: installed stealth hitch, trailer is drawing too much power and draining my battery, can\u0019t drive with the trailer lights plugged in, bicycle tail light makes a good short term fix, but would prefer a permanent fix. \n\nI just installed a stealth hitch for my TM3 so I could move some things from my wife\u0019s parents in Phoenix back to our home in Seattle (1,500 mile trip). The wiring connects to the car\u0019s 12v battery for power, ground in the trunk, and the two rear turn signals. I\u0019m pulling a barebones 4x8 box trailer from U-Haul that has just the marker lights and tail lights. \n\nFor the first 300 miles of the trip, everything worked great. Car handles great and lights work for brakes and signals. Life is good. \n\nThen as I\u0019m pulling into my second charge of the trip, a warning popped up for a couple seconds, \u001c12v power reduced, Vehicle may shut down unexpectedly\u001d. It disappeared quickly. Then a few seconds later, it was back. I noticed the pattern that it would appear whenever I engaged my turn signal or flashers. I unplugged and disconnect the trailer and then charged up to 90%, then continued my trip. No more warnings. \n\nAbout an hour later, it comes back. Warnings flash at first, but then it comes and stays on the screen. I pulled over to the next charger I found and as I\u0019m parking the trailer, the warning changes to something along the lines of \u001cvoltage too low to drive\u001d, and it no longer lets me take the car out of park. Disconnecting the trailer lights makes the warning immediately go away and I\u0019m able to drive. \n\nIt\u0019s now 9pm and I\u0019m about 1,200 miles from home, pulling a trailer with no lights on it. I swing by Walmart and buy two rechargeable bicycle taillights and some gorilla tape and stick them to the back of the trailer so I could continue my trip. I\u0019ve checked both the 12v positive connection and the ground connections I touched and both are secure. \n\nMy diagnosis is that the trailer is simply pulling too much power for the lights from the 12v battery, and the drivetrain battery is not charging the 12v battery quick enough, so after some time, the 12v drops to a point too low for the car to safely drive.\n\nFast forward to this morning. I called Stealth Hitch to see if they had any advice or ever encountered this problem. The engineer I spoke to said this was a first, but agreed with my theory and offered that because the trailer is older and not using LED lights, it could be too much for the 12v to maintain. \n\nI still have around 800 miles to go in my trip and am currently driving around with no lights on the trailer since it\u0019s day time. I\nwill be driving more tonight and would love to try and fix this if I can from a O\u0019Reillys. Wondering if anyone else has pulled a uhaul long distances and encountered this problem or not. \n\nThinking about other solutions, I could put a second 12v battery in the trunk that only powers the trailer, but I have no idea how long it would last or what the best way to recharge it would be. Any other suggestions/ideas?",

      "title": "Potential Tesla Model 3 buyer questions: Monthly cost breakdown of Tesla Model 3 vs competitors like Nissan, Kia and Hyundai?",
      "text": "Like many new EV drivers, I'm just starting my research towards potentially purchasing my first EV so please redirect me if there's a better forum for this post. I'm currently debating between the Tesla Model 3 base model (\\~$35k), the Kia Niro/Hyundai Kona *(base electric models, lumped together for similarities)*, or the Nissan Leaf Plus 220 mile version.  I just finished several days of research, including watching the \"Alex on Autos\" YouTube review comparing the Tesla, Kia and Nissan and I'm still torn.  Also, apologies in advance for the lengthy post below...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Two questions:***\n\n* Does anyone have any other recommended comparison sites or reviews? \n* Does anyone know of a site (or Excel/Sheets template) that allows you to adjust the numbers and compare the month by month and annual estimated cost of owning (financing) these vehicles? I made my own Excel sheet but it's only marginally helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Background info on what I'm looking for:***\n\n**CHARGING LOCATIONS:** I live in  Washington DC  and most of the driving will be reverse commuting out of the city to suburbs, with a few longer road trips to Philly and as far as Boston each year. I checked their Supercharger station map and it looks like there are several new stations in the pipeline for this region, which is great. From my understanding Tesla is offering free lifetime charging at Tesla's Supercharger stations for new Model 3 purchases, is that correct? If so, this might push the Tesla to the top of the list, assuming they continue expanding their Supercharger network. It seems like this access to Superchargers would save a some money, versus paying for DC / Level 3 charging at Chargepoint and other brand stations a few times per month. Living in a DC row house with no driveway or off street parking, I can't install a home charger for the Tesla at my address and my office is too cheap to install a EV charger at this time. Also, most of the DC public chargers are in pay-to-park garages, adding to the charging cost.  \n\n\n**PURCHASE** **COST:** On the other hand, the Kia, Hyundai and Nissan would each come in with a lower purchase price (especially with the current $7,500 tax credit). I live in DC and our only \"state\" tax credit is waiving sales tax, which is nice but not a selling point towards any of the 3-4 models listed. As mentioned above, I'm trying to get a real sense of how the monthly cost of each car compares when you factor in financing, interest, auto insurance, estimated electric charging station access, maintenance, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CARRYING OUTDOOR GEAR:** Finally, I'm an avid cyclist and hiker and would need to carry a mountain bike or two on the occasional roadtrip. It looks like the Kia, Hyundai and Nissan would be compatible with installing tow hitch racks, but the jury seems to be out on whether the Tesla Model 3 officially accepts these without damaging the car? Most of the trails are accessible via paved roads, with an occasional gravel road, so offroad SUV-like  groundclearance isn't a strong requirement. Obviously a single bike would likely fit inside most of these cars, but sometimes it's best for the bike to stay outside, especially in winter cycling.",

      "text": "The M3 RWD keeps dropping in price while the Bolt EUV is hard to find and sells at MSRP or higher. What would you say is the deciding factor to go with one or the other? I already have a deposit (refundable) on the bolt and from what I've seen 2023 M3 RWD are plentiful at the moment since everyone wants a MY or M3LR.\n\nHere's the thing. M3 is getting a significant refresh for 2024. Bolt is being left behind for the ultium battery lineup. I would wait for 2024 when the federal tax credit is POS but in my particular situation there's a $4000 state incentive that's probably running out of funds by the end of this month November. Chevy offers a few other incentives as well noteably a free level 2 charger installation. Tesla has the referral thing.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Bolt, I wouldn't be surprised. I've personally never seen one on the road. The bolt premier has some higher end features even the M3LR lacks, but road tripping with slow DCFC charging speed is dreadful to think about. I'm also leaning towards M3 RWD because, theoretically, an LFP battery lasts 2 to 4 times longer than the older lithium-ion battery tech in the bolt. Of course Chevy's LFP tech Ultium is for next years EVs.\n\nI want to keep an EV as long as possible. My current ICE hatchback is nearing 20 years old and it's seen better days. The bolt would be fine as a main commuter (40 mile round trip/ 5 days a week) but for longevity, the M3 LFP battery may be a safer bet. If I got the M3 I could also without hesitation replace my ICE hatchback for the occasional interstate road trip. Yet the bolt is generally more practical, likely has better build quality, arguably better tech hardware, more passenger space, and slightly less expensive. Any thoughts? And no, I'm not getting both.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I wanted to share my experience with my 2021 SR+ m3 after owning it for close to 2 years. There are few things I want to mention for those who have less than 23,000 miles. I\u0019ve had some electrical problems that came up and I\u0019m guessing soon or later you might have it as well. \n\nThe first electrical problem I had was the power trunk. Though I barely use my trunk, it ended up malfunctioning after few uses. I called the mobile technician and he said that the electrical strut and sensor broke due to \u001cnatural causes\u001d. When I try to open my trunk, it would open about 1/4 of the way and I would have to manually open it all the way. And when I try to close it, it would slam down. It would slam to the point where it would rip off my finger. Good thing it was covered under warranty and it took the mobile technician 30 mins to fix the problem.\n\nSecond problem was the left pillar where you put your key card to open the door. Mine used to work perfectly until few months back it completely stopped working. So that means I literally only had my phone to open the door. But what if I lost my phone? I\u0019d be fu**ed. The doors also wouldn\u0019t open unless my app was \u001clive\u001d and had to take out my phone from my pocket and tap my phone to get in the car. So long story short, I took it to service and there were two things wrong due to \u001cnatural causes\u001d. 1. There was a malfunction on downloading the latest boom box software. 2. Left side \u001cB pillar\u001d needed to be replaced due to water seeping in the wires and rusting. \n\nAgain, it was covered under warranty, but the car is still new. If anyone is having these problems, this is the way to address it. I only share this because I want other m3 owners to be aware of wear and tear of their vehicles. \n\nAside from that, I have close to 40 modifications done to my car and I love my m3. It\u0019s kind of my hobby due to my love for cars. Let me know if you have any questions about mods and I could tell you to the best of my knowledge!!! #tesla4life =O<û=O<û=¯=%",

Ironically enough, I'm an Engineering Manager for a fuel system development and manufacturing company for automotive, so i was supporting the competition and our eventual demise as a plastic gas tank supplier when i bought a full electric.   For all of this to happen while we were driving to a meeting to review fuel system testing was poorly timed, but we couldn't help to laugh at it all.  \n\nThe car was really not safe to drive at that point so i got a hold of roadside assistance, they had it towed from Troy MI to The service center in Toledo, OH.  Tesla arranged for a loaner car (when ended up being a gas guzzling Yukon ).  Despite the loaner vehicle, i was fairly satisfied that this service experience was going to go fairly well...until i reached out to the Service center to arrange to get the car sent back to Troy\n\nI have only been able to contact the shop in Toledo via Texting...i have tried going through tesla service and they couldn't even get a hold of a person to speak to at the shop.   So when i asked about having the car towed or transported back to me I was pretty dismayed to be told that i was on my own to get the car which is 120 miles away.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qf6as59bno31.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5753fa551c20b3b2798b8738667114af436c854e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a concern of mine when i was thinking about making the jump to Tesla... I knew that there was a high chance the car could need to be serviced and being that there are no service centers in Michigan.  BOTH of the Tesla representatives i spoke with (Troy, MI Tesla Gallery, and the Cleveland Lyndhurst Dealership where the car was purchased) told me that Service and warranty items are very convenient and handled by roadside assistance.  \"They will get your car towed to the service center, provide you with a loaner until they return your vehicle to you\" \n\nI reached out to the Roadside Group again this afternoon and they did not even know how to handle this.  They could not get ahold of the local shop, and had to rely on sending emails hoping that something will be resolved tomorrow.  \n\nWondering what other's experiences are like in States that don't have Tesla Dealers or Service centers?  \n\nI am thoroughly unimpressed with the experience so far....I hope Tesla get's their act together and makes this right, but from what i'm reading in other posts. their customer service is a joke.",

      "text": "We picked up our SR+ in blue/black last Friday and have been very happy with it.  The technology is amazing.  \n\nWhen we picked up the car we were told that we had to have it inspected within ten days.  This was further driven home by the police officer who stopped me three days later to see how long I had the car and to remind me that I needed to have it inspected within the allowed period.\n\nThis weekend I took the car to a Jiffy Lube for inspection, and they could not do the inspection because I did not have my permanent registration card.  I think that this is not typically a problem because new cars are usually inspected by the dealer, but of course that isn't the case here.\n\nToday is the last of my ten days, so without a registration I am left with no choice but to garage my beautiful new car until the registration arrives.  I am lucky enough to have another vehicle to drive in the meantime ('10 Fusion Hybrid, a great vehicle but getting up there in miles), but I was wondering if this had happened to anyone else and how long it had taken them to get their registration card so that they could get an inspection.  Or is this just peculiar to Jiffy Lube and I should take it somewhere else.  (No complaints about Jiffy Lube, incidentally - they were the only shop willing to take me at all.)",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI currently have a model 3 all wheel drive non-performance configured. While I'm waiting for the edit button to disappear since August, it has not yet. My delivery range is October through December, so I imagine it will disappear sometime near the first or second week of October.\n\nMy current car is a Lexus IS 250 AWD. It has done me very well even with just Michelin Pilot A/S Tires on it. \n\nBut I have debated, is RWD with good snow tires effective? I live in a driveway that does have a slight incline and I have gotten stuck in it before in my previous front wheel drive Pontiac G6. The driveway also enters from a street and often gets plowed heavily at the entrance of the driveway. I live in a condominium and because our fees are low, they don't do it right job of cleaning up the entrance of the driveway. So there are times I get stuck entering with my old Pontiac. I've had not the same issue with my AWD ALexus.\n\nI live in the hills near Worcester Massachusetts. It's like Boston, but usually about twice the amount of snow and even colder than Boston because of the elevation.\n\nBut I have read a lot about Tesla being centered well because the battery is in the center of the vehicle. And while the 4.5 second acceleration sounds exciting, the 5.1 second one that I test drove was equally awesome versus my Lexus, which is clocked around 8.1 seconds.\n\nAnd for the record, I love my Lexus, but I'm excited to upgrade to my first electric vehicle.\n\nIs all wheel drive worth it or is rear wheel drive worth the savings because I can invest in snow tires and get a little bit more range? My daily commute is around 90 miles round trip. the regular roads are not bad and the highways are usually pretty good in the snow, but the secondary roads can be a bit behind and driveways can be a challenge. But do good snow tires on RWD negate this?\n\nJeff",

A moment I\u0019ve been waiting for, for over a decade is finally coming true and I can\u0019t contain my excitement so I must share here with fellow Tesla owners. \n\nAfter owning 8 different ICE vehicles over my adult life, it\u0019s finally time to go full EV and with a solar system home garage charging solution to boot! \n\nI\u0019ve been passionate about EVs since 2003 when I had the experience of building very light weight single person all electric vehicles in high school. My classmates and I would fabricate an entire EV from scratch through out the school year and near the end of the year, get to race them against other schools statewide. I learned so much in that program and attribute a large part of that experience as the seed that inspired my passion for renewable transportation. But it took Tesla to finally make EVs cool!\n\n\nThis will also mark the first time I\u0019m purchasing a car brand new. Every previous car I\u0019ve owned has been purchased via private sale and a couple through used car dealerships which is a horrid experience. So far buying through the app has been so pleasant I legitimately still don\u0019t believe it\u0019s actually happening. Someone pinch me!  \n\nMuch love! d\u000f ¡\u000fd\u000f",

      "title": "Model 3 NJ Lease questions/lease owner opinions",
      "text": "Good Morning!\n\nSo I am looking at these lease deal and they seem pretty good! I have some equity in my current car was thinking of just selling it and using the equity to get the charger installed, and paying the acquisition fee + first month. I have a couple questions/opinions though as the website is not super helpful lol.\n\n1. When creating the deal, do you put 0$ in the down payment if you just plan to use the $4000 tax rebate as the down payment? I say this because obviously the monthly payment changes significantly. If I put 4k in the down payment, is that estimate what I can expect to pay if I just use the rebate? \n\n2. Leasing& is it worth it? I am reading something here that says I forgo the right to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease. This is worrisome to me. I have leased a number of times in the past and I typically go over the miles but rarely care because if I re-lease they tend to just wipe away the overages or the car has equity and I just sell it, or if I\u0019m not getting a good deal anywhere I just finance it until I can sell it vs returning it. With Tesla, are none of these options??? I just don\u0019t want to get hit with wear and tear fees, mileage fees, on top of needing a new car at the end of the lease. \n\n3. All the \u001cextra\u001d fees.. everyone talks about not paying for gas or oil changes.. but more I look into it, there are a ton of other fees. It\u0019ll be about $1000.00+ for the charger to be installed in my house (doesn\u0019t look like my electric company gives and rebates for Tesla branded chargers), Looks like insurance rates jump up for EVs as well, there\u0019s a monthly fee for their online access, plus you still (while cheaper) have to pay for electricity and things like tires and brakes, and expensive mechanical work when it is needed (which hopefully none of that is needed on a 3 year lease). Just feels like any extra \u001csavings\u001d are just eaten up elsewhere. \n\n4. Experience with RWD tesla in 4 weather climates. We had a mild winter this year in jersey, and we do have a AWD suv that my wife uses, so trips and bad weather we just use that, but between range loss and snow/cold rain, do you feel confident on the road with the rwd? Snow tires are an obvious solution but that\u0019s goes up to number 3 another $1000+ just to make the car work.. and in NJ, the winter is not always winter weather. I\u0019ve had small rwd cars in the past (had an FRS when first released) and it was \u001cfine\u001d, but def had troubles in poor weather. Also, I have a garage but not for the car to go into, I hear this car is not great with cold weather, do things like door knobs or range really ruin the experience? \n\n5. Is the 250-260 mile range genuinely enough? On Monday-Friday my general commute is 45-50 miles a day. That\u0019s home to gym to home to work to pick son up to home. But for instance to see my parents, it\u0019s 175-200 miles round trip with no extra stops. Obviously this all sounds like it falls within range.. so range anxiety is maybe misplaced. I\u0019m not too worried about longer trips as we can use my wife\u0019s suv. \n\nI know this is long, just thought I\u0019d get some feedback/opinions.\n\nThanks!!",

It's a, um. A product defect, I guess you could say?  \n\n\nThere are 9 cases overall (US+Korea, excluding China) where this has happened, 8 in the US and 1 in Korea... Yes, that's right. Korea is me.  \n\n\nI didn't want to be the only one.  \n\n\nOnce the engineer checked with the US HQ , he said that in such cases, the connector that communicates with CAN is disconnected and shipped as a temporary measure.  \n\n\nAfter disconnecting the connector, no error codes occurred and the car went to sleep.  \n\n\nNow, what happens if the connector is not connected? Some functions are limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Openning**  \n**Monitor -** can be opened with the open button  \n**Trunk switch** \\- can be opened with the trunk switch  \n**Keyfob -** can be opened by double pressing the trunk section  \n**App -** can be opened with the trunk open button\n\n**Closing**  \n**Monitor -** Close button is disabled and unavailable  \n**Trunk switch** \\- can be closed with trunk switch  \n**Keyfob -** No... just no  \n**App -** No... Just No\n\n   \nYes, that's right, the electric trunk function works for now, but all the parts that operate the closing function through the vehicle PC are not working.  \n(The key pop and app all receive signals from the car's PC, so they shouldn't work)\n\n  \n US HQ is aware of this error and is working on improvements accordingly.    \n\n\nIn conclusion, my retrofit electric trunk has become a half-assed product... Honestly, I'm very upset. \n\n  \nSince it's a defective product, I thought about reinstalling it with another product or asking for a refund... For now, I don't have time, I have to use my car, and even if I reinstall it with another product, there is no guarantee that there will be no error... So for now, it came out.\n\n  \nAnd I already knew about the case in the US HQ... In the article from HQ, it seems that they are investigating and want to improve it even if it takes time... It's a problem that will be solved when the noise-catching improvement comes out...\n\n  \nIn Korea, you can preemptively take such and such measures... Since the US is the HQ and there are warranty conditions...  \nIn this regard, it was very unfortunate that the Korean center cannot make arbitrary modifications/temporary measures and can only take measures according to the HQ's guide .

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm in search for a new vehicle to replace my Hyundai 2013 Sonata. Originally I was looking at Hybrid vehicles like the Sonata 23, Elantra, Camry, Prius, etc.\n\nMy price range is about $30K. The hybrids I was looking at were basically starting out at that price, with no government incentives (Illinois apparently dont consider hybrids or plug-in's).\n\nThen my boss told me about the price drop of the Tesla's. \n\nHe is a pretty enthusiastic Tesla owner of a Model Y (he was pissed about the price drop, having bought his a year earlier). I started doing some thinking and looking at the price. $39-40K right now and with the government incentive of -$3750 since I missed out on the full $7500 government incentive March deadline.\n\nIt is a little out of my range but.....\n\nMy questions are:\n\nAfter months or years with your Tesla Model 3, how is it? Has the whole no maintenance / oil change thing been that big of an improvement? \n\nWith the price drop, I'm sure even with the lower amount of incentive, not having to pay for gas moving forwards would balance out the additional upfront cost of the car itself. Is it worth it in your eyes?\n\nWould any of you regret your decision? Do any of you wish you'd have gone the hybrid or plugin hybrid route? What are your thoughts?\n\nI dont care about the whole political crap with Elon. I just want something fuel efficient and pleasant to drive.",

      "title": "First Year Ownership Experience and Review From The Perspective of a BMW Enthusiast",
      "text": "I have had my Model 3 for 1 year 10 months and 11 days. This post is long overdue. \n\nThough I am a relatively young driver at 26, the Model 3 is the most satisfying car I\u0019ve owned and one of my all-time favorites to have ever driven. That is not to say that the experience has been 100% positive. Moving from my 2015 3 Series to the Model 3 had little to no learning curve, but the refinement the Bimmer offered is noticeably absent. The following comparison best represents my experience coming to terms with the Model 3's features, personalities and quirks. \n\n**Exterior Styling**\n\nAggressive lines and large grills&where would we be without them? In a time where car designs are edgier than an angsty teenager, the clean flowing lines of Tesla\u0019s vehicles are a welcome sight. That\u0019s not to say I\u0019ve always felt this way. When the Model S got its facelift, I protested. When the Model 3 was unveiled, I swore it off due to its duck-lips-like front facia. The Model 3 just didn\u0019t look like a conventional car. Then again, isn\u0019t that the paradigm Tesla is working to uproot? The BMW now blends right into the crowd. From behind I\u0019d almost mistake the 2020 redesign for a Lexus. Almost.\n\n**Interior Design &amp; Finish**\n\nAs for the interior...well...it\u0019s somewhat of a tossup. Each get equal points for styling either for Tesla\u0019s take on the \u001cApple approach\u001d of elegant simplicity or the BMW\u0019s sense of familiarity and class. Yes, there\u0019s a lot of buttons and walnut but it\u0019s such an accommodating and inviting cabin. On Tesla\u0019s approach, I find the openness and natural light lends to a more relaxing environment. I love them both. \n\nNow let\u0019s talk about materials. Tesla\u0019s vegan \u001cleather\u001d disappoints only in the mind. I find the material much more satisfying to touch and feel when compared against the Napa leather seats I had in the Bimmer. They\u0019re also much more comfortable to sit in but they SORELY lack support when cornering. The rest of the cabin is also much more pleasant to touch in the Tesla where the BMW had some cold hard plastics in places it shouldn\u0019t have. \n\nHowever, premium materials and build-quality aren\u0019t mutually exclusive. Tap the various panels and compartments in the BMW and you\u0019ll find them satisfyingly solid where the Tesla is hollow. Sometimes too hollow. The upper interior panels of the doors in my 3 for example have far too much flex as does the headliner above the driver\u0019s seat. Don\u0019t get me started on the piano black center console. \n\n**Driving Dynamics**\n\nWhere the BMW is definitely the driver\u0019s car centered around the experience and connection with the road, the Tesla skips or misses the same level of engagement and response. That\u0019s not to say the driving dynamics are any less satisfying, but the experience\u0014exhilarating or otherwise does itself at times feel simulated. \n\nBMW: Sir, the outside wheel is slipping. We\u0019re about to go sideways. Shall we proceed?\n\nTesla: I\u0019ve corrected your mistake and allowed the rear to kick-out within manageable parameters. Wasn\u0019t that fun.\n\nIn the end, despite their fundamentally different behavior, I find them equally ready to be both the daily driver and the weekend warrior. \n\n**Technology**\n\nCars have become increasingly connected and complex machines. Tesla has a history of designing their automobiles from the ground up to be so much more. However, I find the more intriguing question to be whether or not it\u0019s as affective as it is disruptive. Is car culture ready for Autonomous Driving and the Tesla touch?\n\nWhile the Bimmer shamelessly outclasses the Tesla in equipment options, the Tesla holds a clear edge with its potential. Yes, there\u0019s no gauge cluster. There\u0019s \\*almost\\* no buttons and no tactile response. You WILL get over it. Touchscreens were a foreign concept when the iPhone first came out. Now, they\u0019re second nature.\n\nThis is not to say that Tesla\u0019s execution and adoption of Technology are perfectly implemented. Basic creature comforts are missing with no clear indication of why. There\u0019s no CarPlay. No routing options to avoid highways. No ventilated cooled seats. No HUD. No powered trunks. \n\n**Cost of Ownership**\n\nOne of the first things on anyone\u0019s mind when my Tesla comes up in conversation is its environmental and economic benefits. I\u0019ll admit that neither of these factors had much of an influence on my purchase, but I did make an effort to track these costs. As I have a daily commute of about 13 miles, I am able to easily top off with a 120v charger connected to a Currant smart outlet that monitors usage in real-time and provides a monthly report. \n\n2019 Tesla Model 3 AWD \n\nFuel: $545.04 (3,893.17 KWh @ $0.14c/KWh)\n\n Maintenance: $137.49 \n\n Repairs: $2,916.80 \n\n Insurance: $2,022.72/yr\n\n **Total: $5,622.05**\n\n2015 BMW 328i \n\n Fuel: $1,575 \u0013 estimated (20 MPG @ 3.50/gal for Premium)\n\n Maintenance: $283.99\n\n Repairs: $1,009.94\n\n Insurance: $1,887.60/yr\n\n **Total: $4,756.53**\n\n**Service Experience**\n\nTesla\u0019s service experience leaves A LOT to be desired. Facilities are few and far between with exceedingly long wait times. Service centers can\u0019t be reached by phone and the only way to communicate with a service advisor is via text.  I have had to wait an average of 6 weeks for body work and 1-2 weeks for general service and maintenance requests. Avoid damaging your car at all costs. \n\nMy experience with BMW\u0019s service centers was exceptional. My service advisor went above and beyond to be available and accommodate requests on my schedule. Repairs were carried out quickly, but did have one return visit for an issue that could have been easily avoidable. \n\n**Summary**\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Tesla\u0019s Model 3 and hope that those on the fence at least keep an open mind when shopping for their next vehicle. You'll experience some growing pains, but the convenience of fitting an Electric vehicle into your life might just surprise you.",

      "text": "Unfortunately my 2022 LR model 3 with 21K miles broke down while on vacation 700 miles away from home. \n\n\u001cUnable to charge service is required\u001d\n\n\u001cVehicle may not restart service is required\u001d\n\n\u001cElectrical system is unable to support all features\u001d\n\n\nThis is what came on the screen while I was supercharging the vehicle, afterwards it wouldn\u0019t move and the A/C wouldn\u0019t turn on. Long story short Tesla told me it was the 16 volt battery and they won\u0019t have it in stock for 2 weeks so I need to fly back home. Is this a common issue or will I have to worry about the battery going out every 2 years?\n\nThey told me they can\u0019t ship it back to without it coming out of my pocket. also said I would need to fly back to pick it up but I\u0019m definitely going to fight back on that.\n\nUpdate #1 08-07-23\n\nI got an email saying they ordered a HV battery and will be arriving in 2-3 weeks. I asked for clarification but I\u0019m assuming that\u0019s the high voltage battery and this is worst case scenario. Luckily we are still well into our warranty, (only had the car for about 18 months) Will update when i confirm / will let everyone know what they reimburse. \n\nA lot of people have been asking why I didn\u0019t stay or try to fix it myself. I was on a quick 2 day vacation to the beach, the service center was closed over the weekend and we had to get back home for work so we took a flight out. We also get married in one month so everything is just on a tight time crunch. They claimed they will reimburse for all the expenses but I will be sure to update where I\u0019m at after the car is repaired. From what it seems like they will process everything after the car is repaired.\n\nUpdate #2  08/08/23 \n\nI called Tesla and they confirmed they ordered a high voltage battery and will be down for about 3 weeks. The LV original diagnostic was a virtual one when they didn\u0019t have the vehicle in the SC yet. When the car arrived they confirmed it was the HV battery. \n\nWorking with my local SC back home for a loaner, my insurance told me they won\u0019t cover a rental unless I was involved in a accident. Will update what my local SC says when they open up today.\n\nUpdate #3 08/08/23\n\nThis will likely be the last update until my car is fixed. My local SC told me they don\u0019t have any loaners available. They also mentioned their hands are tied since my vehicle isn\u0019t even at their SC. Apparently it\u0019s a new policy they can\u0019t allow cars to cross state lines / loan a car out to someone who\u0019s car isn\u0019t at that service center. At this point I\u0019m done, no point in raising my blood pressure any higher over this. I\u0019ll update everyone as soon as they say the car is ready / if they will hold their word on reimbursing me for all of my flights and Ubers. Car should be ready around August 28th.\n\nUpdate #4 12/25/23\n\nI\u0019ve had the car back since August 28th and it has been working normal since then. I\u0019ve charged it to 100 percent one time and the range actually read longer than the original range on the older battery. The SC ended up sending me a check for both of the flights to leave / come back to pick the car up. Will be sure to update if I have any issues.",

      "title": "Thoughts on my new Model 3 from a Porsche enthusiast/owner",
      "text": "I began shopping recently to replace an older Cayenne which was my daily driver for quite a while, a fantastic vehicle that was surprisingly not that bad on gas for being a 400hp V8 (about 22mpg average). I still own a current gen Cayenne with all the handling upgrades (PDCC, PASM etc). I've had many dedicated sports cars over the years but currently do not have the luxury of keeping one around purely as a weekend car. \n\nCayennes really have everything you look for in a car, safety, fantastic handling and performance for a big vehicle and exceptional comfort for relaxed driving, plus reasonable economy for what they are.\n\nOriginally I hoped to pick up a GR Corolla as a somewhat economical performance/DD car, unobtanium. Golf R? Unobtanium at sticker, but a really great car, very Porsche-lite. So I expanded my search a bit, I drove the Acura Integra... garbage for the price. An Integra at 28k? Sure maybe, but at 40k? No way. As a primary daily driver, I wasn't looking for a manual, the CVT totally ruins any sporting characteristics of the Acura, the CVT is truly abhorrent.  Subaru WRX? ABSOLUTE shit box, 20ish MPG and it doesn't even handle well, also basically 40k, at least the Integra has a pretty nice interior, my old commuter 2010 Prius had a better interior than the brand new WRX.\n\nOn a whim, after seeing the 10k over sticker at the local VW dealership for the Golf R, I stopped in the Tesla place next door and took the Model 3 out. It was IMMEDIATELY clear this car is so far beyond anything in its price range its an absolute joke. \n\nSteering feel is huge for me personally, and right away I was shocked that it was... pretty damn good! Is it Porsche level? Not quite... but \"not quite Porsche level\" is an insane compliment for most cars. \n\nMy current Cayenne is tuned and fast as hell, its about 3.8 to 60mph. I ended up with a LR AWD which is technically a bit slower, but it doesn't really feel slower. Past 80-90mph? Sure the Cayenne really takes off vs the Model 3 but everyone knows Model 3s are quick, no need to go in depth about that. Concise version, not really a downgrade from a 500+HP twin turbo Porsche, albeit a porky one. \n\nHandling and brakes? The Model 3 LR AWD can't really compete with the total package of adjustable air suspension, Porsche's brilliant adaptive dampers, dynamic chassis control combined with 315 width Pilot Sport tires anchored by absolutely massive brakes. But for the price? Its ACTUALLY a drivers car. It blows away the WRX, Integra (non Type-S), BMWs in its price range etc. \n\nAt its price point you can get an used older last gen Cayman/Boxster/M car, a new Miata or GR86. Those are the only things that have a bit more drivers car cred than the Model 3. Yes, I am ignoring used Corvettes, Camaro 1LTE, Mustangs etc, I know they can be fantastic but... no.  \n\nI didn't touch on the Taycan but they are in a totally different price bracket, even high mileage used examples. The EV tech is behind the Model 3 for the most part, even ignoring charging network, total non-starter for me. I have no doubts a kitted out Taycan is better than the Model 3 but its basically double the price for a used example that MIGHT have the proper options to truly eclipse the Tesla. Pricing out a NEW Taycan that I would by any metric rather have is $120k. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.\n\nLong story short, the Model 3 absolutely shits on ANYTHING in its price bracket, ICE or electric. \n\nNow to the negatives... man... as soon as I clicked accept delivery of the Model 3 I was dropped like a hot potato. The delivery experience was horrible. In fact, it was non existent. The delivery lady pointed across the parking lot, pointed out a Camry and said its over there by that car, you can watch some videos in the car... and then literally almost ran away. I stood there for a bit dumbfounded. At the time of delivery I had spent maybe 20 minutes in a base model test driver car and had no idea how anything worked. \n\nI immediately found a massive gap between the window and B pillar, checked it in to service before even opening the doors after chasing down an employee. A few other doors are quite poorly aligned but I expected this and wasn't bothered. I did not know I had already accepted the car in the app... in my opinion I felt duped by the Tesla app into accepting the car. I should have been more careful. \n\nThe next day I actually drove the car home, the window B pillar gap looked better in the parking lot, I had no reason to expect that hadn't actually repaired the car. \n\nThey didn't repair the car. \n\nPerhaps they pulled the door molding out a bit so the gap wasn't immediately obvious, but definitely did not attempt to fix the issue, or fix and test drive to car to verify it was indeed fixed like the Tesla app stated. \n\nIn fact, they didn't even close out the work order days later so I couldn't make a new service request without a 45min long phone call trying to explain the issue and finally have someone click a button to fix the problem. As of right now, the issue still isn't resolved and the wind noise is unbearable without music playing. I have a mobile appointment upcoming in which I HOPE they will fix the issue. I figured out how to fix it own my own with some googling but I'm not breaking out the wrenchs just yet to fix a brand new car. \n\nAs of writing this, I still have gotten zero replies to any text messaged questions or concerns sent in the Tesla app since taking delivery and it took about 90 painful minutes on the phone to get a service appointment. \n\nTL;DR: Absolutely fantastic hardware and performance that is untouchable at its price point. Terrible experience so far post delivery. I knew what I was I was getting myself into with Tesla, great product, shit company, **the pros definitely outweigh the cons at its price point** but wow... a few tweaks and the ENTIRE experience could truly be next level. \n\nPostscript: I won't be getting rid of a Porsche anytime soon. When I have the freedom, I'll go back to a 911 or a Cayman from my Cayenne. Why? Because the driving enthusiast community experience is built into owning ANY Porsche, from a ratted out ancient 944,  6 year old base model Macan, to a brand new 911 GT3 RS, you can show up to events big and small without prejudice. I'm active in the PCA and nothing can replace a 400 mile day of canyon driving with a bunch of like minded individuals. I haven't searched in depth but haven't found anything like PCA events for Teslas, this is ignoring the fact that big canyon days behind the wheel aren't really as feasible with an EV at this point in time.\n\nAt the end of the day, any Porsche with the proper performance options from Cayenne to Cayman is a more satisfying drivers car, I doubt anyone but the biggest stans would argue that... but its shocking how close Tesla is with the Model 3 relative to its current price point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "Honest / critical Model 3 review coming from nicer German cars.",
      "text": "I've had my M3 LR for about 6 months now and have been driving it almost exclusively. I thought I'd write the review I wish I had read when I bought it.\n\nContext. The M3 is my first EV. I have mostly owned higher end German cars (manual BMWs, E46s and E88s) most of my adult life together with nice trucks. Recently had to replace my last BMW and given some work / life priorities I figured I'd go with something utilitarian. \n\nAfter 6 months (or even 6 hours honestly) of ownership, I discovered that most of the things you read in reviews or posts are probably coming from people with a different perspective than mine and that many of the things I personally was worried about where not at all major issues while others I didn't think about were. So here's a list of the good and the bad (no ugly). \n\nThe good.\n\n* Yeah, the car is fast. I know this is top in every review but it does put a grin on your face even if you're used to pushing an M5 around a track. This fact is actually pretty important in making an otherwise utilitarian tool enjoyable. \n* Home charging is genuinely nice. I could care less about the cost of gas, I'm used to filling up $100 / wk, but there's something really appealing about just leaving in the morning and not suddenly realizing that you forgot to fill up and rushing to work. I have 240V in my garage and the simple mobile charger and I can reliably get the charged up from zero overnight. If I get home after work with a low charge for some reason, I usually have enough after a few hours to go out. I can envision situations in which it would be limiting but after 6 months, I haven't encountered one.\n* 99% of the time the whole \"but will i have enough range for a road trip\" question is bullshit. I've done multiple road trips and while I live in the northeast and there's decent supercharger availability, it's really a non-issue. I suppose there are people who live in genuinely remote places, for whom this is going to be a real concern but it's probably not you.\n* Speaking of superchargers, again I honestly prefer this experience to filling up. Maybe I just hate gas stations. You park, plug in, and check emails for 15 min or go to the bathroom or grab a coffee. Again, maybe some people really need to drive 8 hours straight with minimal breaks and if that's a big deal for you, you won't like this. For most people though, it's a non issue.\n* Autopilot is nice and it's particularly nice that you can use it seemingly more liberally than in other vehicles with similar tech. I turn it on on arterial roads or even some larger neighborhood roads. It's nice not to think about traffic and unlike many rental cars I've had with lane keeping - it will steer sharply and it will go for a while without human input.\n* The touchscreen is also a non-issue. I thought I'd hate it but after day 1 you're kind of over the lack of gauges. Occasionally it's annoying to find something but for the most part it works. Having autopilot helps not have to fumble around in the UI while trying to steer.\n\nThe bad\n\n* If you're used to nice cars, this is not a nice car. Period. One thing I realized is that a lot of M3 users are coming from a Honda or Toyota and they are mind blown by the speed and even the fit and finish is an upgrade. If you're coming from anything German, it's going to be a notable downgrade. I'm not talking about the manufacturing issues per se - just the overall materials, level of comfort, etc.\n* Along the above lines, road noise is by far my biggest complaint. A decade of driving insulated German cars simply does not prepare one for the constant tire drone on the highway. It sucks bigly.\n* A lot has been written about fit and finish. I won't comment on this much because honestly I actually care less about panel gaps or occasional paint issues. You do however notice quality issues elsewhere. My TPMS sensor went out a few months into owning the car and I had to get it replaced.  The interior occupancy sensor is probably busted which results in the bluetooth not pairing automatically. The windows will occasionally not come back from the retracted state when you close the door. Occasionally the car will stay on after I leave. Stuff like this is pretty annoying.\n* Autopilot will occasionally try to kill you.\n* The LR supposedly has a vaunted speaker system. It's ... fine. All of my older cars had similar or better sound systems.\n* Tesla cheaped out in a number of places that really cause frustration. They skipped a $0.20 rain sensor in favor of using the cameras and the automatic wipers are garbage and either go off like crazy or keep going without stopping. They use cameras instead of radar for cruice control which is both scary and degrades with bad weather in a way that radar doesn't. It's actually wild that you may end up losing cruise control entirely in bad weather in a way that makes the car worse than a '99 accord.\n* They also cheaped out on a capacitive sensor for the steering wheel, so you have to actually yank it when autopilot complains about not having steering input. This is majorly annoying.\n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting something but this about it.",

      "text": "I'm in Louisiana and was just hit by a major hurricane and was out of power for about 70 hours.  While my city was spared with avoiding serious damage, being out of electricity in the summer heat here is dangerous.  Heat index the past few days was at 100 degrees, and my house's temperature was in the mid 80s at night.\n\nHaving a Tesla was a HUGE benefit.  I charged the battery to 90% before the storm and slept in the car for 2 nights in camp mode.  In the worst of the heat, when my fans running around the house on generator power wasnt enough to keep cool I put me and my 3 dogs in the car and cooled off watching netflix for a bit.  Talk about handy when you spend 3 days just covered in sweat.\n\nOther major bonus - the Tesla supercharger was available so I could charge my car with just a little wait time.  Right now, gasoline is VERY hard to come by and people search for operating gas stations and wait for hours hoping they can find some for their vehicles and to keep powering their generators.  I was able to charge up to full, drive an hour away from areas hit by the hurricane and fill up a couple more gas cans to deliver to people in need.  \n\nIf anyone is near Ida's path and is looking to help, these folks need gasoline the most. Neighbors are sharing gas and generators where possible, but the scarcity of gas is really crazy right now. Water, food and other supplies are also good.",

      "title": "Model 3 LFP Review after 60k miles",
      "text": "Hopefully this post will provide some info/context to anyone considering purchasing an LFP Model 3. I\u0019ll keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI took delivery of my LFP Model 3 on February 21, 2022. I drive a LOT for work, and I chose the Model 3 for the potential gas savings and autopilot. I\u0019ll share my actual savings below as well as degradation and repairs.\n\n**Battery Degradation:**\n\nAs of today, I\u0019ve driven just over 60k miles. I\u0019ve experienced roughly 4% degradation in this time. Brand new, the car showed 272 miles of range. It now shows 261. This has not impacted my daily driving in any way. I charge to 100% every day. Electricity is a flat $0.09/KwH in my area. I live in the south, so winters are moderate.\n\n**Range Anxiety:**\n\nI would comfortably trust this car for \\~190 miles on the highway at highway speeds (80mph) during the summer. During the winter, 140-150 miles. Far less than the advertised range. For me, I don\u0019t mind stopping every 2.5-3 hours to charge. I would normally stop for bathroom breaks and to stretch my legs, so this isn\u0019t a huge deal to me. That being said, if money were no object, I would go with the long range. More for the charging speeds than range. This car is limited to 170KW supercharging, while long range models can charge at 250KW. Faster charging would be nice.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nRepairs are minimal with this car, but I\u0019ve had a few.\n\n1: The most significant issue was a drive unit failure. The car just suddenly failed on me during a road trip - I couldn\u0019t drive the car at all. Thankfully this occurred while parked. I had to get the car towed to the nearest service center (90 miles away). Took Tesla about 3 weeks to fix. They paid for the repair and my rental car during this process. No issues since.\n\n2: I\u0019ve had the seal repaired on both front windows three separate times. I was experiencing significant wind noise, and replacing the window seals has yet to fix the issue completely; it\u0019s \\~ 80% better, but I suspect the front windows are misaligned on the track within the door, causing an imperfect seal when fully rolled up, thus causing wind noise at high speeds. Not an issue for city driving. I\u0019ve decided it\u0019s no longer worth trying to fix and I just deal with it.\n\n3: I\u0019ve replaced tires once in 60k miles, costing roughly $1600. I didn\u0019t rotate tires properly during this period causing my back tires to wear rapidly. Tesla recommends rotating tires every 6000 miles or so.\n\n4: I had the back glass replaced due to a rock cracking it. \\~$800 repair.\n\n5: not technically a repair, but it cost me $1300 to have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet at my house. My mobile connector was included with the car at the time of purchase, but Tesla no longer includes these for free. This will add \\~$250 to your charging installation cost.\n\nNow onto savings. My previous vehicle was a 2014 Ford Fusion Energi (plug in hybrid) which got around 40mpg when running in hybrid mode. Over the last year according to the Tesla app, based on gas prices in my area and my previous car\u0019s MPG, I\u0019ve saved around $2200. Not quite the savings I was looking for, but if you\u0019re switching from a less fuel efficient vehicle your savings would be better. Gas is roughly $3.20 in my area as of Sept 18th 2023.\n\n**Things to consider when purchasing:**\n\nI live in a small town, and none of my local tire shops will accept any Teslas for tire rotations. The nearest Tesla service center is two hours away. This won\u0019t be an issue for me 99% of the time, but for any repairs larger than a tire rotation, I would have to drive two hours to have my car worked on. Thankfully, Tesla mobile service alleviates most issues. I can have my tires rotated for around $70 with mobile service. (Yes I will be doing this myself in the future, I\u0019ve since purchased the required tools)\n\nTLDR; After 60k miles, I\u0019ve experienced 4% degradation in my Model 3 LFP. 272mi -&gt; 261mi. I charge to 100% every day. I\u0019ve experienced range anxiety one time in 60k miles, but I drive an abnormal amount. Repairs have been minimal. Best car I\u0019ve ever owned, but if I could do it again I\u0019d get the long range for faster charging speeds.",

      "text": "Back in 2017 I wanted an affordable way to go all-electric.  So I decided to go with the refreshed Nissan Leaf 40 KWh.  I assumed that Nissan (having made the Leaf for years) knew what they were doing with electric cars.  I was badly mistaken.  The car was perfect for around the city trips.  It still is the quietest car I've ever driven.  But an overheating battery, poor efficiency, and unreliable dealership chargers (my sole method for road tripping) just made for a super miserable experience.\n\nI took what I learned from the Leaf, cut my losses, and decided that what I needed was a good charging network, a liquid cooled battery, and a CCS plug.  Enter the Chevy Bolt.  I heard about this new network called Electrify America and their plan to cover the United States and thought THIS was a good affordable car option.  And it would have worked perfectly, except there were still 2 issues that made some trips a bit of a drag... max 50 KW charging and Electrify America's truly awful reliability in the early days.  The reliability still is pretty bad with Electrify America but it is getting better.  Anything is better than how they were!\n\nThen in 2020, the Chevy Bolt battery recall hit.  At first I got extremely frustrated at all of the issues I'd had up to that point, plus this.  But I turned this issue into an opportunity to get rid of the Bolt with a buy-back and get into a Tesla.  I got the Bolt bought back at almost the full purchase price and then used that to buy a 2021 Model 3 SR+.  I'm extremely happy with the Model 3 and I'm blown away with the ease of charging!\n\nSo I hope you enjoyed my story of mistakes and suffering!  I wish every EV was like this, because this is how it should be.  And I hope y'all can appreciate just how good the Tesla hardware really is!\n\nOh and, because I feel the comments coming, I really wanted to own an affordable, non-luxury, hatchback.  I have a big dog and we go on adventures constantly, so a cheap hatchback I can tear up is still preferable... but I guess I can make the Tesla work :)",

Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect [5-star safety rating](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa) as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government.\n\nIn addition, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which offers 240 miles of range, a top speed of 140 mph, 0-60 mph acceleration of just 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior.\n\nTo achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only. You can now buy a Tesla in North America via your phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn\u0019t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free. With the highest consumer satisfaction score of any car on the road, we are confident you will want to keep your Model 3.\n\nShifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. The important thing for customers in the United States to understand is that, with online sales, anyone in any state can quickly and easily buy a Tesla.\n\nAt the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you, rather than you coming to us. Moreover, we guarantee service availability anywhere in any countries in which we operate.\n\nWe\u0019re also excited to announce that we\u0019re implementing a number of firmware upgrades for both new and existing customers. These upgrades will increase the range of the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 to 325 miles, increase the top speed of Model 3 Performance to 162 mph, and add an average of approximately 5% peak power to all Model 3 vehicles.\n\nTesla is committed to making not just the best electric cars, but the best cars, period. And our products are the reason we continue to [rank #1 in Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/10-most-satisfying-cars-owner-satisfaction/) and have every single year since Tesla was first eligible to be included in 2013. Both Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are available starting today at [Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA).",

      "text": "This probably won\u0019t be a popular post but I\u0019ll post it anyways. I have had my M3LR for a little over a week and the car is a fantastic car overall and much better to drive than traditional ICE vehicles. However in my 10 days of ownership I have found there is one huge drawback that I think will slow down the mass transition to electric vehicles and it\u0019s range. I live in Iowa and it\u0019s winter now (anywhere from 10-40 degrees Fahrenheit) so I expected the range to decrease and I\u0019m willing to deal with the decreased range in the winter but I\u0019m not even getting 200 miles from a 90% full battery. I just drove ~65 miles and my battery went from 90% to 56% and I didn\u0019t have heat on for half the drive. If we want the mass transition to EVs as we all do cause we are part of this group, I\u0019d say the battery capacity needs to at least double to convince the average Joe or Jane to buy an EV. The car is great but I wouldn\u0019t recommend the car to anyone that doesn\u0019t want to deal with the drawbacks of the car -- range. It works great for daily driving, leave come back home plug in and wake up to a full car but road-trips are far from ideal compared to an ICE car. Something I\u0019m willing to deal with because I love the car but I don\u0019t see the majority of the population adopting EVs until chargers are more readily available and possibly charge faster. Just a thought and I\u0019d be interested to see if anyone else agrees/disagrees and why.",

      "title": "My 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; AKA whatever the opposite of brevity is. ",
      "text": "Here's my 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; an exercise in word vomit.\n\n**Review context:** Over a decade of driving Audis, a 2019 B9 S5, a 2015 B8.5 S4, and a 2010 B8 A5. The B9 S5 and B8.5 S4 could not have been more different in temperament. The S4, with a 6-speed manual, was an absolute thrill. Pulling to redline was a neck hair standing crescendo of supercharger whine and unadulterated exhaust noise. The B9 S5, with the ZF8 was the polar opposite, a wave of torque that died out above 5k RPMs and an exhaust note that rivalled a belabored wet fart. Don't get me wrong, the B9 was an ultra comfortable highway cruiser, with the capabilities to carve up the twisties, it just really became an appliance to and from work 99% of the time, with 1% side dish of fahrvergnügen. I have a Mk1 Volkswagen to drive for fun, so I didn't really need my daily to be a true driver's experience. The B9 elapsed its warranty, and with the impending prospect of new tires, new brakes, a 50k service, coupled with all the reports of rocker arm failures, I decided it was time to abandon U-boat and apply those funds to something new.\n\n**Ordering Experience / Delivery:** Both the S5 and S4 sort of found me. My Audi sales manager knew my preference for any color as long as it was gray, sport package equipped, late run S cars. He'd often call me when he would have a leftover, typically in the middle of winter, when he couldn't sell a car on summer tires to anyone other than a moron *(me)*. Entire car purchase on both the S5 and S4 took no more than 3 days, and were completely painless. Ordering a Tesla was as far from that process as you can get, granted it was generally what I had expected. I placed my order for the M3P on April 25th after watching the Jason Camissa and Top Gear reviews at 1am. Not being able to \"haggle\" with the dealer, let alone communicate with a human being was strange. The only time I communicated with what I thought was a human *(likely ChatGPT)*, was via Tesla app texts, typically them requesting documents or further ownership info. The estimated delivery date changed no less than 9 times, an Action Park \"Alpine Slide\" of emotions I'd have preferred not to have rode. My trade in estimate expired 3 times, however the trade in value remained the same from 4/24 through my pickup on 7/5, since I did not exceed the allotted 1000 miles. This kept me right-side-up enough to cover T,T,L,A and FMP of the Tesla. Carmax offered me $800 more, but the tax offset made this a pointless endeavor. Delivery was the first time I talked to a human being, a wide eyed late 20 something who clearly consumed entirely too much espresso *(and Elon Koolaid)* before he came to work. At the recommendation of other Tesla owner's I did not sign any final documents, or pay the \"final payment\" until after I inspected the car. I had been expecting the worst during inspection, after reading numerous horror stories on FB and reddit, however the only issue with the vehicle was a scratch on the carbon spoiler, which Tesla will be replacing free of charge at the end of the month.\n\n**Now onto the '24 M3P itself:**\n\n**Exterior / Styling:** I had always had my eye on the pre-Highland M3P, but the lack of differentiation from lower spec models kept me from taking the plunge. I really appreciate the unique front bumper, front splitter, rear diffuser and rear spoiler. I also think the Highland headlights and tail lights look much more refined in their styling. The lack of fog lights is a bummer, but I also felt the same with the lack of fogs on the S5, no biggie. The dimensional comparison between S5 and the M3P are almost identical, albeit the M3P is 2\" taller. I will say, the '24 M3P styling is enough to make me look over my shoulder when I walk away from it. I find the M3P to look aggressive, yet stealth, which is right up my alley. The little features and details do it for me. It's by no means Pininfarina or Giugiaro penned, but I think it has a clean modern aesthetic, especially with the new lights and bumpers.\n\n**Suspension:** Wow. I'm wholly impressed. Where the B9, that also rode on 30 series tires, felt harsh, clamoring over rode imperfections, the M3P feels so well sorted in comfort or sport suspension setting. Someone described hitting a bump in the M3P as \"one and done\" and that could not be more accurate. There is a marked difference between \"comfort and \"sport\", but neither are too far at the end of the spectrum. \"Sport\" definitely increases compression dampening, which influences body roll *(or lack there of)* but remains compliant and comfortable. In comparison, the S5, with dampers set to \"sport\", was liking having shocks filled with portland cement; I used that setting all of 3 times in my 4.5 years of ownership.\n\n**Chassis:** The low center of gravity of the M3P also contributes to the \"on rails\" feeling. Where the S5 window seals would sound like the intro to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\", creaking and groaning entering my driveway, the M3P makes not a peep. This indicates to my Neanderthal brain that the chassis is stiffer, a feat when you consider the entirety of the M3P roof is glass. On one \"bit too enthusiastic\" *(re: entirely too fast)* entry through a concrete paved exit ramp, the coefficients of friction and adhesion were communicated well through the car, the seat, and directly into my clenched *(yet perfectly cooled, more on that later)* derriere.\n\n**Steering:** On my mindless commute, I tend to forget how noncommunicative modern power steering is, however one drive in the Mk1 reminds me the fact that a steering wheel can tell you, in braille, what is is happening at the interface of rubber and road. The M3P and S5 are equally numb; you're feeling so faithless, lost under the surface, you just can't feel it there *(Chester Bennington croons in background)*. Ratio wise, the M3P feels a bit sharper than the S5, especially on turn-in. Turn the wheel, the nose tips in quickly and without drama. Lock to lock, there are less turns in the M3P, but similar resolution and control. In normal driving, the M3P's \"Light\" setting is perfect, for spirited driving \"Medium\" adds just enough preload to keep from being too darty. \"Heavy\" is akin to the the tiller at the helm of Moby Dick's Pequod, entirely too weighty, severely delaying steering inputs. I will likely never use that forearm vein bulging setting, due to the heft, which is pretty incredible when I'm reminded of the fact that the steering rack in the Mk1 has been failing and ejaculating fluid onto my garage floor for the better part of the last 3 years.\n\n**Power:** There is no comparison here. The S4 and S5 were by no means slow cars, I'd even say you could consider them fast when compared to most cars on the road *(F35 catapulted from the deck of a carrier when compared to the Mk1)*. The M3P is otherworldly. Instantaneous torque is an understatement, \"Ohm my f\\*cking god\" is more accurate. Acceleration builds just as quickly as the throttle pedal changes angle. My first time using \"Insane\" mode, which is so aptly named, caught me off guard and strained a muscle in my neck. Passengers have squealed in delight, excitement, and or *(mostly)* fear, gripping the seat base bolsters and door handle to stabilize themselves. I have driven 911 turbos, M3s, M4s, M5 and M8 competitions in anger *(thanks BMW Track Days!),* and while on paper, those cars have similar acceleration times, there is nothing that compares to the rapid torque delivery of an electric performance car. Yellow traffic lights? If you can see it, you can make it before you squeeze the tomato. The M3P is unwavering in pull up to the \\~110 or so miles per hour I've gotten it up to, with no interruptions for gear changes. I have no instrumented documentation, but I fully believe the 2.9 second 0-60 and sub 11 second quarter mile. It is a thrill, even sans a screaming cacophony of internal combustion, however, you are missing the auditory reference point to gauge speed. The acceleration is cocaine level addicting, and I need to keep Randy S. Alpert Esq., my faithful traffic attorney, whom I've previously funded braces for his children's teeth, at the ready on speed dial.\n\n**Interior:** While I dig the minimalist design, I had been having anxiety over a lack of dash cluster since long before delivery, contemplating adding an aftermarket screen to satiate my need for through the steering wheel data. 10 minutes of driving, that need was gone. The speedo at the corner of the main screen is in your periphery and was easy to adjust to. The lack of signal stalks on the other hand took longer to break 25 years of muscle memory to get used to. While the turn signal buttons are easy enough to use with the pad or side of the thumb, I still occasionally find myself reaching for a stalk that isn't there. I won't pontificate on the fact that all controls are through the screen, other than it must be purgatory for anyone aged boomer or above, as you are essentially driving a rolling smart phone. The seats are comfortable, and supportive, but at 6'3\" and 200lbs, I think I am right at the limit of what can fit between the bolsters, which were adjustable on the S5. My brother, a man of oxen-like man, at 5'9\", \\~270, plainly did not fit in the seats and mushed the seat bolsters to my chagrin. With not nearly as many adjustments as the Audi seats, which were awkwardly flat in shape, I was able to easily find a comfortable position in the M3P's contoured and supple seats. The air conditioned seats, which were not available in my Audis, are a welcomed addition to someone that would describe their basal state as diaphoretic. My significant other, whom while wearing a sundress, referred to them as feeling like \"menthol for your labia\" and I cannot stop chortling about that. Fit, finish and materiality is markedly better than the pre-Highland Model 3s I've driven / rode in. I would say I am generally impressed with the interior that is on par with the Audi quality I have become accustomed to. The addition of full acoustic glazing makes it a quiet place to be, though I rarely notice this due to what is underscored in the next section. I will say, I do miss having massaging seats, but I think that's a fair trade for icy angels singing sweet sonnets upon my sweaty taint. The only other cons I can think of are a lack of operable sunroof and a glass roof that allows heat to build in the interior faster than an air fryer can preheat for my late night dino nuggets. Thank the 'Lon for the ability to precondition from my phone.\n\n**Audio:** All 3 of my Audis were equipped with the Bang Olufsen sound system option. They were never impressive, with a lack of bass and a tinny sound that made the money thrown towards that option seem better spent on the aforementioned cocaine addiction. The Tesla in comparison is amazing. Weighty, mirror jiggling, bass, crisp highs; I've yet to find a track that has overextended the speaker cones. Of all the features, the M3 audio system caught me most off guard, I was not expecting such a strong sound system. Thoroughly impressed and soon in need of an audiologist.\n\n**Build Quality:** I guess time will tell here. I can say, the doors close with a satisfying thud akin to the German cars I've owned. Materials feel generally of high quality. The paint finish on the other hand is not of German car quality, with minor, yet noticeable, orange peel when viewed at oblique angles. On my example, panels gaps, while not post-Third Reich tight, are completely acceptable for a car of this price point. However, I can report that on a trip down the drive-thru line at Sonic for cherry limeades, the wheel aero covers make a highly annoying clicking / clacking noise. I will likely remove the covers this weekend. I can also report, the cup holders easily secure 44 fluid ounces of fast food beverage.\n\n**Summary:** All-in-all, I am very satisfied with the M3P. It is a dutiful appliance to get me to work, while still having the power and agility to provide some thrills. In the first 250 miles, I have saved $50 in fuel alone *(thanks free charging at work).* The reviews that led me to take the plunge, in my experience, are completely accurate. If I had to list my biggest complaint, it's the stigma of people thinking I'm an Elon supporter just by driving one. I love the movie \"The Hateful Eight\", does that make me a Harvey Weinstein supporter?\n\nI'll likely edit and add to this, as my fingers and brain fascia have become fatigued, but anyway, thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0imtz7kywbd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f779a4d5db1fd99b2ca22a00c429f88ca12887ca",

      "text": "We are excited to celebrate our one year anniversary of taking delivery of the Model 3, LR, AWD with 18\u001d aero wheels.  The car is beyond fun to drive and the car\u0019s feedback loop is continually making the car better.  Over the past year we have given demo rides to numerous friends, family members, co-workers, early adapters in our community and even some who have simply stopped to ask questions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq5ocjetbnf31.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d195b4fe9839bdc64575950d23b1d06d91cece60\n\nPeople often ask us about range anxiety and maintenance costs. To celebrate our experience we offer you our one year summary:\n\nWe took delivery on August 10th, 2018\n\nPut snow tires on at 6,800 miles (we live in a rural area)\n\nRotated snow tires at 13,000 miles\n\nPut summer tires back on 19,700 miles\n\nRotated summer tires at 27,000 miles.  We will replace our summer tires next spring when we take our snow tires off.\n\nFilled windshield washer fluid twice.\n\nChanged cabin air filter at 28,500 miles.  Note this was completed by Tesla\u0019s Mobile Service saving us a six-hour, round trip to our closest service center in Eden Prairie, MN at no extra cost!\n\nWe have washed our Model 3 more over one year\u0019s time than we had all our previous cars put together!\n\nNormally we charge at home at night using a NEMA 14-50 outdoor wall plug that uses off-peak power.  We love waking up to a car that\u0019s charged to meet our daily needs whether that is a 65% charge or 100% charge.  During the last year we have super charged 79 times for a total cost of $449.88. Our average cost per charge was $5.70 and our average super charging time has been 32 minutes.  We also used destination chargers at lodging facilities and two RV parks to charge in remote areas.\n\nDuring our trips, we used \u001cA Better Route Planner\u001d and loaded it into the car\u0019s computer to display on the screen.  We personalized the planning data based upon our current situation (average wh/mi, temperature, wind, road conditions). We set our lower battery arrival level at 20% to cover for unknown elevation changes and weather conditions (temperature, precipitation and wind).  Using their recommendations, we selected superchargers or destination chargers from the Tesla listings.  Most of our miles have been driven on Enhanced Autopilot.  \n\nOur lifetime wh/mile for the year is unknown but we started with TeslaFI on January 1st, 2019.  Since that time TeslaFI has tracked 17,350 miles with a 269 wh/mile average with our average temperature being 55 degrees F.  Over the same time period, our battery has degraded 2.4%  Since January, we have received 8 over the air updates averaging 22 days between each update.  \n\nOne of our most memorable experiences was while we were supercharging at the Flying J Travel Center in Fort Stockton, Texas.  A father came up with his twelve-year old son while we were eating in the Travel Center.  He asked if were were the owners of the Model 3.  It was the first one they\u0019d seen.  The son knew everything about the specs of the Model 3.  They both smiled as we showed them our car.  His son\u0019s knowledge, excitement and pure joy in witnessing an all-electric vehicle gave us hope for the future.\n\nThis photo was taken at Inspiration Point, located 2 miles west of Lanesboro, MN.",

I am fortunate to have access to a free nema 14-50 plug at my office so I try to charge as much as possible at work.

      "text": "Having a 2022 Model 3 with FSD has been an absolute game-changer for me. I installed a charger in my garage (did it myself since the circuit box is close by), and I just plug the car in whenever I get home. My daily routine is simple\u0014I drive to work, and on days when I need to travel to a town about 77 miles away, I can go there and back with plenty of charge left for errands. I never think about charging or range. It's seamless\u0014no more gas stations, oil changes, or constant maintenance worries. The car just works. I even had a flat tire once, and the car's alerts helped me manage the situation smoothly. The Model 3 has been incredibly reliable, with the only warranty fixes being minor things like a broken plastic part, and they even came to my house for that. The FSD and auto park features are fantastic and make driving easy and enjoyable. It parks perfectly every time, even if it takes a bit longer. Honestly, I see this as my forever car. It's fun, dependable, and takes all the hassle out of driving. If you're on the fence about getting an electric car, this experience might help you decide!",

      "text": "So last week I took over from my wife driving for Lyft part time with our Tesla (she gets anxiety around strangers and I don't get a lot of chance to drive the car, so win/win). I'd love to heard some experiences from others that are doing the same thing; interesting rides, passenger responses, etc. Here's a summary of what I have noticed so far:  \n\n\n1. Something like 95% comment on how nice the car is and how much they like the inside. The other 5% are those that barely speak English or are otherwise quiet on the whole ride looking at their phone.\n2. Only about 2-3% have ever been in a Tesla before\n3. A good 30% , including many that know its a Tesla, still think it uses Gas/is a hybrid of some kind\n4. Everyone is amazed when I tell them how much it costs me to charge fully at home (and really I'm saving $50 on my electric bill compared to before the Tesla thanks to Utah's tiered program that's only available with electric cars)\n5. Just as with cost to charge, no one realizes how affordable it is, even when i mention the one i had was 47k they are amazed. Many think they are still around 100k.\n6. The best ride I've given so far regarding someone excited about the car was to this sweet old guy who apparently does daily trips across town to be with his wife. He was one of the few that I was able to show the acceleration too and wanted to see it (I wont do it unless someone asks/I can do it safely). He said he wished they had him when he younger as he would have definitely bought one. His son just got a Model S but he hasnt gotten to ride in it yet.",

      "text": "My Tesla M3 LR had the charge cable stuck in it for two days and even the emergency release from the trunk wouldn't work, The next available mobile service was Next January 5th 14 days away, Tesla suggested over the phone and via chat that I unplug the charger from the wall and put it in the trunk with the cable still plugged into the vehicle and have my car towed 2.5 hours away to a service center as I live in the midwest they're far away. \n\nI tried everything for two days, watched every video and read every blog/thread. zero answers or solutions.\n\nAnyways I spent all night studying the locking mechanism and what components actually interact during the charge port locking and unlocking action, then found out the magnetic solenoid switch that you're trying to activate by the non-direct-force emergency release is actually an emergency release electronically actuated button that is manually pressed or activated by way of you pulling on the emergency release cord, and no matter how hard you pull, the switch is just trying to initiate the actuation ( electronically ) via the signal sent by the action of the cord being pulled.\n\nAnyways, it's currently 1 degrees here and snow is on the ground, what i found out through my hours research of magneticly actuated solenoid switches is that they can seize up due to low operating temperatures. so I got the idea to go in the trunk find the location of the end of the emergency release pull cord and I found the solenoid at the other end of a ten inch cord on the left side of the trunk under a 5 inch by six inch rectangular-esc orange cover, the solenoid switch is about 2 inchs by 2 inches and 70% exposed, i ran an extension cord with a blow dryer and placed the blower on high and pointed it 1 inch from the solenoid switch for approximately 3 minutes then manually pulled the emergency release switch , pushed in hard on the charger wand then herd the switch actuate and release the wand. I wiped everything down and put a few drops of lubricant on the charge wand locking point and switch and it is locking and unlocking with no problem!\n\nLiterally got the idea from a video of a guy doing the same thing to an older model truck with a electronically actuated solenoid starter switch.  \n\nJust yesterday I changed the Magnetron on my $700 Frigidaire microwave that's a built in, with a part that I ordered directly from china at a fraction of the cost of a repair man's estimate for parts and labor, I fixed it in 10 minutes, to say the least you can literally do anything. >p=\n=\u0018\n\nOpen for any questions.",

      "title": "Thoughts after first 5k miles with 23 M3P",
      "text": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the M3P I purchased earlier this year and wanted to share some thoughts for anyone thinking of jumping in.  \n\nI'll start with some dislikes first:\n\nPaint - I went with white because it's free and because I live in the desert where any other color is going to get nuclear hot in a short time.  The paint on delivery was pretty much fine - no obvious defects other than a tiny spot on the hood where there was some contaminant under the paint.  But in just under 5k miles, the front bumper looks like absolute hell.  Chips galore, almost all down to the black plastic underneath.  The fremont paint is pretty worthless at standing up to the tiniest of rocks.  You can either accept that you'll need a repaint, or do PPF.  \n\nBasic Autopilot / Autosteer Beta - Utterly embarassing.  Coming from a Volvo with PA, the ADAS in the Tesla feels horribly implemented.  Phantom braking galore, freaks out when lanes widen, etc.  It's just not predictable, which is a must when you're designing a system of this type.  I really dislike that it automatically disables with even minor steering input - there's a pretty fine line between the amount of steering input required to let the system know you're there and the amount that immediately disables autosteer.  I don't think this is going to get much better down the road either, between the hardware that's missing and the fact they've already been working on it so long and are yet so far behind other manufacturers.  Not a huge deal for me, as I really only use it on long road trips, and it's not nearly as bad on the interstate as it is on highways.\n\nWheels - The uberturbines are kind of cool looking, but that's about it.  I'm going to get some 18s to replace them.  Looking forward to a smoother ride and better economy.\n\nSound - Cabin noise levels aren't terrible, but without a gas powered white noise generator directly in front of you, road noise is a lot more apparent. I put in the front wheel well insulation from RPMTesla and slapped some dynamat inside the front fender while I was at it and it made a huge difference.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nInterior - Wasn't sure how I'd feel about the single screen situation, but it has been pretty seamless.  The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the audio is great.  0 rattles or squeaks have manifested so far.\n\nPrice of ownership - Electricity is pretty cheap where I live (12.5 cents/kwh) so my costs to keep it running with at home level 2 have been minimal.  I've done 79% of my charging at home and only 21% at superchargers.  While my supercharging rate is nearly 4x more expensive (42 cents/kwh), it's not exactly breaking the bank to top off on road trips.\n\nPerformance - Hard to not smile when you floor it.  Braking could be improved, but coupled with max regen is perfectly adequate.  Steering feels precise and has good feedback.  Tiny gripe is that the turning circle feels pretty wide given the overall size of the car, but it isn't something I notice much.\n\nInfrastructure - Out west, supercharging makes ownership extremely easy.  0 range anxiety on any of my trips.  The only place I've looked into going where it might be a hassle is a long roadtrip to Yosemite from east of the park - there's just not a lot of options around there.  \n\nOverall I'm very happy with my purchase and think this vehicle is tough to beat as a daily commuter.  It's a strange package altogether to be sure - midrange price, miniscule cost to own, accelerates like a solid rocket, and farts on demand?  \n\nAnyway, longish post, hope this helps anyone considering a purchase.",

As the title states, I was given the surprising news last week that I would be getting a Model 3, an exceedingly generous graduation gift that I absolutely did not expect and do not deserve. I had been planning on buying myself a Toyota Yaris next year, lol!\n\nAnyhow, delivery is expected in March! I chose the midnight silver metallic color, black interior, and aero wheels.\n\nMy questions for the community are:\n\n- I live in the Bay Area, but currently do not have access to a charger for overnight in my living space. Is this going to be a big issue?\n\n- What was the learning curve like for you switching to electric? I\u0019ve never driven anything but gas powered vehicles.\n\n- How difficult are the wheel caps accessories to put on? I\u0019d like to remove the aero covers but heard installation can be tricky. (EDIT: I am extremely embarrassed to find out how simple this was >!)\n\n- Is there anything you wish you knew before you\u0019d purchased your Model 3? I\u0019m all ears!\n\nAny info is appreciated, thank you! :)\n\nEDIT: Yes it was a college graduation, not high school, dear lord that would be even more obscene. Also, I\u0019m 28 years old so I\u0019m a more experienced driver than younger graduates, which I think played a tiny part in all this.\n\nEDIT 2: Wow! I\u0019m floored at how welcoming you have all been and the amazing tips and advice I\u0019ve been given, you went in to so much more detail than I ever expected and I\u0019m so grateful!\n\nI was a bit nervous posting here and including the fact that it was a gift for fear of being judged or written off as some spoiled brat, but figured it was important to add because otherwise I\u0019m sure people would have just asked why I didn\u0019t do more research before buying the car, haha! Anyhow, thanks again everyone!\n\nP.S. & As icing on the cake, my delivery was just bumped up to January-February, so I\u0019m stoked!",

      "title": "Tesla Model 3 Winter Range - My Experience",
      "text": "A frequent question in this forum is about range in winter, so I wanted to share some of my data that I have accumulated over the past 4.5 years with my 2018 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD (pre-heat pump), living near Minneapolis, MN. It\u0019s not quite Canadian weather here, but I feel I can be a pretty good barometer for colder climates.\n\nFirst, a little background on the data I collect. I have been trying my hardest to take a picture of my odometer and clear my trip meter on the first of every month. I then enter the data into an Excel spreadsheet with some accompanying data like the average gas price, electricity cost, and temperature stats for that month. This gives me some good long-term stats and a great graph to back up my temperature related observations.\n\n[Graph from tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/whef6z9ytzma1.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de267d66d3ef4e63bff8c9a01fac9a428bee6bb9)\n\nLet me first dismiss the common misconception that in winter, \u001cyou can automatically expect a 30%-40% range loss.\u001d Sure, you can have a drive here or there where the range loss is bad, but when you look at the averages for an ***entire month***, you will see in my graph that the only times I ***ever*** got that low was during the 2019 POLAR VORTEX weather event. Let me remind everyone those two months it was abnormally cold where at one point the actual air temp got down to -27° F and stayed there for almost a week.\n\n[My tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/52ap5jyfuzma1.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95dd0f1a39b9307eb4356bc6e5b1e0aec6c2d61d)\n\nBack to the spreadsheet data, if you calculate the range loss from NOV through MAR for the last 5 winters combined, it averages to a -17.53% loss. (Not so bad considering the average internal combustion engine typically drops between [\\-15%-24% in the winter too](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/coldweather.shtml).)\n\nHere is another interesting observation from my spreadsheet. According to the EPA\u0019s web site, my Model 3 has a blended rating of 290 Wh/mi (29kWh/100 mi). Much to my surprise, the spreadsheet\u0019s calculations back that up with 290.03 Wh/mi over the life of my vehicle.\n\nDigging into the graph a bit more, each blue dot on the graph is the average monthly temperature versus the average watt hours per mi achieved during each month. You will see that I also added a green EPA rating line at 290, a blue 32° F freezing line, and a purple trendline for the blue dots. \n\nThe purple trendline crosses the EPA rating at right about 43° F. This means the when the average temp for the month is over 43° F, that I usually got ***better*** than the EPA rating. When the temp is under 43° F, my Wh/mi was typically in the 300-350 range, I assume because I only have the PTC resistance heater and no heat pump. What I have noticed anecdotally, is that when the temperature is between 65°-75° F, that is the sweet spot for efficiency. For August 2019, called out on the graph, I had a 17.24% ***gain*** in range with nice weather.\n\nIn conclusion, having 30%-40% loss during a ***single trip*** indeed happens, but that drastic of a loss for an ***entire month*** would likely only happen due to some unprecedented weather conditions (think Polar Vortex). \n\nWhen people ask about my range loss in the winter, I am quick to point out that my personal experience is \"actually pretty close to the winter gas mileage losses in my old Toyota Camry.\" Practically speaking, when doing road trips to ND to visit my in-laws in the winter, we usually have to sit at the supercharger for an extra few minutes, but it really isn\u0019t much of a bother.",

      "text": "This car will primarily be used for commuting to work 3 days a week (about 40 miles round trip). Very infrequently, we may use it do day trips (60-300 mile trips). We have a Subaru Forester for everything else.\n\n**Tesla Model 3 - Standard Range Plus** (about $41k all-in)\n\nRange - 263 miles; RWD; 7-13 week delivery\n\n**Tesla Model 3 - Long Range** (about $50k all-in)\n\nRange - 353 miles; AWD; 10-60 weeks delivery\n\n**2021 Honda Clarity Plugin Hybrid** (about $34k all-in, credit takes effective price down to about $27k)\n\n$7500 federal tax credit available\n\nRange: 47 miles (electric), 340 (combined); FWD\n\nThoughts on Tesla:\n\n* (+) Teslas offer over-the-air software updates that improve range/power/etc\n* (+) Tesla offers the fast-charging ecosystem for longer trips\n* (+) Tesla has a trunk and a frunk (front trunk)\n* (+) Lower cost of maintenance (no combustion engine)??\n* (-) Tesla would probably require an in-home charging unit (extra $1k or so expense)\n\nThoughts on Honda:\n\n* (+) Hybrid relieves anxiety around charge! Easy to go on longer trips without recharging stops.\n* (+) $7500 federal rebate!\n* (+) It seems that Honda is offering better financing (0.9% APR vs 2.49% APR)\n* (+) Less likely to need an in-home charger (though it would still be convenient)\n* (-) Less premium options (e.g., cloth seats)\n* (-) Less cargo space\n* (-) Higher maintenance costs (combustion engine), but still lower than a standard engine\n\nIf I chose a Tesla Model 3, I'm leaning towards the longer range and AWD, but it's an extra $10k. Compare that to the cost of the Honda Clarity with federal rebate ($7500) and it's a $20k difference (though the Clarity is FWD).\n\nConsumer Reports gives both cars similar scores and ultimately recommends both (Honda Clarity has a score of 80; Tesla Model 3 has a score of 78).\n\nIs there anything else I should be considering for a Tesla (both positive and negative)? Anyone else consider the Clarity?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks to everyone for the thoughtful comments!\n\nIt sounds like there are a lot of reasons to buy a Model 3, many of which are intangibles. I'm excited by the low maintenance costs and very inexpensive cost per mile. I'm not a typical car person (drove older Honda Civic's my whole life), but Teslas are far different than typical cars.\n\nI am definitely leaning toward the Model 3 and scheduled a test drive for tomorrow evening! I'm fully expecting to be wow'ed! Given I want the car in the fall, and the delivery times being what they are, I should decide soon!\n\nSince it fits in my budget, I will probably spring for the LR. I live close to Philly and the AWD will come in handy January through March. Plus, the LR will give me a little extra juice in the cold months.\n\nThanks again!",

I'll try to touch on the most important parts. Coming from a 2012 Kia Optima that I loved, I actually thought I'd miss it... how absurd?!\n\n# Pros\n\n* **No Traditional car dealership** \\- Just custom ordered online and picked up 3 months later. In and out of the dealership in 20 minutes.\n* **Absolute joy to drive** \\- The ride is quiet and smooth, the acceleration is unlike anything else and the steering is super responsive. It's so much fun to drive! I'm still constantly looking for reasons to drive and I still giggle every time I punch the accelerator. Driving my wife's Honda Civic now feels like some sort of punishment. \n* **Software Updates** \\- My car has gotten BETTER since I first purchased her 6 months ago. With each update I've gotten new or enhanced features like mirror auto-dimming control, Disney +, carwash mode and bug fixes. The app has also been packed with features like live sentry-cam viewing and I can now talk through my car with a monster voice! That made halloween more interesting for sure! Very cool to see Tesla is actively pushing upgrades and staying on top of software. \n* **Charging at home** \\- I always wake up to a \"full tank\", no more going to the gas station! I use the regular 110v mobile charger that came with car and plug it in every time I get home. According to opti-watt, I consume about **$10 worth of electricity every month.** \n* **Roadtrips/SuperCharging** \\- SuperChargers are basically everywhere and the trip planner works great. Absolutely no range anxiety at all. SuperCharging is cool, and gives you some time to grab a bite to eat or take a power nap. \n* **One pedal driving** \\- Because of Regen Braking, you really only use the accelerator to drive. I got used to it very quickly and now prefer it, it's contributes to making the car such a joy to drive. Regen Braking also makes driving downhill very efficient as it feeds energy back to your battery and increases range. It's an amazing feeling to be creating energy like that.\n* **The Tesla App** \\- The app is awesome and allows me to basically control the entire car. I can set/schedule Climate control, making the cabin nice and cozy. I can schedule charging, toggle sentry mode, view live cameras and acts as keyless entry/start so I don't have to carry keys. I can also share directions with the car so navigation is q'd up and ready when I get in. The app makes everything very convenient.\n* **Miscellaneous cool features** \\- Things like, Auto-Fold Mirrors per location, so now when I pull up to certain parking spots, my mirrors fold automatically. Voice commands work really well and come in very handy while driving. The fart/emissions prank is silly and everyone loves it. DogMode is great and very useful.\n* **No oil or scheduled maintenance** \\- No more oil changes every 3k miles! Driving one of the most American made cars on the road and no longer dependent on foreign oil.\n* **AutoPilot** \\- Basic AutoPilot is pretty impressive. It steers, brakes and accelerates for you. It makes morning drives more relaxing. I understand it's a work-in-progress, so I stay aware and keep my hands on the wheel, but it works well for the most part. \n* **Easy to clean** \\- The interior is minimal and really easy to wipe down. The seats are durable and basically stain resistant. I just use a damp warm soapy rag and everything cleans up so nicely.\n* **Mobile Service** \\- My driver side interior pillar wasn't properly clipped in, I just didn't notice at delivery. I scheduled mobile service using the app and a tech showed up 3 days later, fixed the pillar in 5 mins, we admired/chatted about the car and he left. It was perfect. \n\n# Cons\n\n* **Cruise Control Phantom Braking** \\- Using TACC (Traffic Aware Cruise Control) I've experienced a few very dangerous instances in which Cruise Control braked heavily while at highway speeds for no reason at all. This was extremely scary and could have resulted in a bad accident. It makes using Cruise Control nerve-wracking and make me apprehensive to relax on the highway or road trips. **If Tesla had a dumbed-down Cruise Control that only set your speed, nothing more... This car would be absolutely 100% PERFECT.**  \n\\*I fully understand Phantom Braking when using AutoPilot because AutoPilot is trying to drive for you and it's still a work-in-progress. **Cruise Control should work differently.** \n* **My wife wants to drive it all the time** \\- It only took her a few rides and now she wants to drive it everywhere! She's not usually impressed by much, but she is in love with this car.\n\n**TLDR:** This is the best car I have ever owned and possibly the best purchase I have ever made. No buyers remorse at all. Even after 6 months I still make up reasons to drive it and often find myself standing in the garage just looking at it haha.   \nMy only complaint is the need for a **dumbed-down** or **classic cruise control** to eliminate phantom breaking. If Tesla provided that in a future Software Update, it would easily make the car 100% perfect, in my opinion.",

      "text": "I ordered a Model 3 Performance and am having second thoughts due to my charging situation. Our house was built in the early 90\u0019s so long before EVs were even a thing. The builders put our electrical panel on the opposite side of the home from where the garage is, so getting a level 2 charger installed in the garage is an expensive task especially given the size and layout of the home.\n\nI\u0019m fine with using just the standard 120v mobile charger on a nightly basis (my daily commute is 8 miles each way) and I also have the opportunity to used the mobile charger via a 240v dryer plug during my WFH days. Can\u0019t use the 240v on a nightly basis as the wife\u0019s car is parked on the side of the driveway closest to that area. \n\nThe one challenge I have with the nightly use of the 120v method is that the closest outlet happens to be in a storage cabinet (not sure what they were thinking at the time of putting the cabinets in prior to us owning the home). Will this be OK or do the mobile chargers tend to get fairly hot and I should be worried about and fire or overheating dangers with it?\n\nAm I making a mistake thinking I can make an EV work for my scenario and as a daily driver?",

      "title": "Thoughts, Musings &amp; Experience: Delivery Day &amp; Day 1",
      "text": "Picked up my Midnight Silver Metallic AWD Tesla Model 3 yesterday (2018-09-25) and wanted to share my experiences in the first 60miles.  Not a lot of time, and only 1 day of ownership, but everyone asks - so I figured I'd tell.\n\nI've been on the reservation list since April 2016, and have been counting every day I've been waiting.  As with almost every other post like this... all I can say is that it is worth the wait.  The car really is everything I wanted it to be.  If you are still in line, just hang tight.  \n\n\n(Quite a lot of information below, so hopefully it answers questions for you.  Feel free to ask questions.  Please give me a little latitude on the flow - I've been writing this in little chunks since last night.  If something isn't clear, let me know and I will update.)\n\n----\n**TL;DR** : TL;DR : Amazing vehicle. PPPPP<\u001f<\u001f (7 out of 5 Stars).   By **far** the most performant, enjoyable, and technologically advanced machine on wheels I've ever been in.  I fly helicopters for fun, and the Model 3 is gives those experiences a run for its money.  Certainly the most exciting vehicle with wheels I've ever been in!\n \n*Images:* [Side View](https://i.imgur.com/rwpqUHy.jpg) , [Interior View](https://i.imgur.com/1zq0MzV.jpg), [Nose View](https://i.imgur.com/FzOVReH.jpg)\n \n----\n\n**Positives / Cool Things**: \n\n* Delivery was fast and painless.  No paint issues to notice. No misaligned panels.  Car seems perfectly built.  Will update if something changes here.\n\n* AWD has incredible torque and pickup.  I've not been able to *open it up* fully yet - but the fact that I could get to 85 in about 100ft was amazing.  Not even a chirp from the wheels when I launched either.\n\n* The sleek interior is perfection.  Nothing to distract your view or your driving experience.\n\n* The display is very impressive.  Driving at night is quite easy by not having the bright dash board right in your visual center (as is with other vehicles).  Automatic dimming is impressive.  A little daunting for the first 30 minutes, but very easily understood and usable.\n\n* Phone Key is a great idea.  Walk up and it turns on. Walk away and it turns off and locks.  Very simple to use.   I was a 2 x Leaf owner (2013 and 2016) and I am used to turning it on and off. So, felt a little weird at first, but I'm sold.  It works.\n\n**Negatives / Odd Things**: \n\n* Automatic Windshield Wipers \u0013 definitely need tuning. Not impressed - and in truth, this is my only real gripe with the car.  The area had torrential rain yesterday, and I found myself moving from Automatic to full-speed wipers manual... often.  Way too often.  Also, towards the end of the storms, the system would not trigger until I was nearly unable to see out of the windshield.\n\n*  The charger door seems a little temperamental when it comes to automatically opening with the charger cable.  Touch always worked for me, but I'm at about 50% with the charger.\n\n* Door handles are awkward.  I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but \"push with your thumb and grab\" is an odd motion for a car.\n\n* Smudgy surfaces everywhere.  Center console display, glossy storage area doors.  I'm not sure I would have gone with glossy surfaces.  I'll probably do a wrap on the console.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n**Delivery:**\n\n* *Summary:  Very efficient and fast delivery out of the Devon, PA dealership.  They were very busy, 4 cars in the out-door, covered delivery bay when I pulled in.  Paperwork was ready, and signing took 5-7 minutes.  Demo, walk-through, initial setup was about 20 minutes.  Then I was in the car, and on my first drive home.*\n\n* Walked in, met an admin who was signing people in.  There were a few people waiting in a seating area, and I was offered coffee and a seat.  I declined (really didn\u0019t need any more caffeine, I was excited enough already), and he told me someone would be with me in 5-10.\n\n* 3-5 minutes later, my Sales Specialist showed up, took us to a table to get a few signatures, review paperwork.  Since 99% of it was already done online, it was mostly a formality.  Got my PA registration documents, and wrapped it up in &lt;10 minutes.  I was asked to wait a bit until my Delivery Specialist was ready.\n\n* We burned 5-10 looking at the Model X.  (My wife got the glimmer in her eyes& so maybe someday.)  Was met on the floor by our Delivery Specialist who walked us out to the covered out-door delivery bay, and proceeded with a quick demo, walk-through, and setup session.\n\n* Started with the key-card lock/unlock process, then right in to getting both of our phones registered with the car, and got my personal settings (seat, mirror and steering wheel) set in the car.  We both had the apps pre-downloaded so it was a fast run through.  Quick overview of the in-car storage, task lighting, and marveled at the clean look, with very little \u001cstuff\u001d \u0013 it is all in the built in display!\n\n* Next, a walk through of the navigation systems, soft-buttons (how to open glovebox, turn on audio, seat heaters, open trunk/frunk, etc).  Touched on most of the setting screens one after another.  To be honest, it was a little too fast for consumption or retention.  But, I\u0019m glad I saw it all with someone there.  Knowing my own style, it did not bother me, I knew I\u0019d be back that night \u0013 in the garage \u0013 to go through it all on my own pace.\n\n* Then a quick demo of the charging door, lights, cables, connectors and adapters.  Kind of surprised they do not have a SuperCharger at the dealership \u0013 I\u0019d call that  pretty big miss on Tesla\u0019s part.  Every dealership should have at least one.\n\n* We ended with the ceremonial photo, and then delivery was done.  About 25 minutes of Demo/walkthrough.  Whole thing took ~30 minutes from rolling in to the dealership to zipping out at Mach 3 in my Model 3.\n\n* *Note*, the Devon, PA Tesla dealership is not permitted to do PA Inspections, so you will have to do that at your local spot sometime in the next 10 days.  Not a big deal, and not Tesla\u0019s fault at all.  This is all due to PA\u0019s bizarre laws alone.\n\n\n**Interior:**\n\n* *Summary:  Interior, while it felt sparse at first glance, it really well designed and integrated with the display.  Clean lines and attention to detail is very clear in this car.  Materials are high quality.  Road noise is minimal.  Audio System is bangin'*\n\n* Visibility is very good.  Side view, rear view mirrors are well placed.  With a little adjustment they cover everything I need to see.  Not able to identify any real blind spots.  I love how the car auto-magically adjusts when a known user gets in.\n\n* Seats are very comfortable.  Firmness and fit is great for me.  Adjustment are sufficient and can give you a great fit.  I recommend taking the time to adjust things a few times to get it right.\n\n* I sit rather low in the car - and that makes entrance and exit less than elegant, so I may need to adjust a little.  Once seated visibility and comfort are fine.\n\n* I was a little shocked by the dash/display in the car.  When you first get in things are suspiciously empty and the display looks imposing.  Likely this is just because you are so used to every other car in existence.  And, in truth, this car is nothing like any car in existence - and as soon as you cross that threshold, there is no coming back.  Once you get comfortable with the interface and the buttons, it makes sense.  So, I guess what I'm saying here is ignore and trepidation you feel in the first few minutes in the car.  It is designed this way for a reason.  Trust in Elon. :)\n\n* I love the amount of *hidden* storage in the car.  Behind every door is a nice space to store things.  And, they all seem to go way far back too.  Same goes with the trunk - pull up the cover, more space!  I'm not a fan of the black gloss doors.  I feel like they will get smudged and scratched.  Only time will tell, but that's my assumption at this point.  I'm looking at the matte black wraps - and I feel like that will do what I really need.\n\n* Audio System sound is fantastic.  Really impressed with the speakers in the car.  Very high end sound, crystal clear, no oddities.\n\n* Back seats are quite comfortable.  Plenty of leg room.  Oddly enough, two people sitting in passenger-rear have had issues putting on the seatbelt and using the center-seat's connector.  They use the shoulder belt, and end up putting it in the wrong socket.  Have not had the issue myself.\n\n* Both front and rear \"open the door\" buttons seem awkward.  People always seem to assume they have something to do with the windows.  Likely just a training issue, but it isn't intuitive at this point.  \n\n* Glass Roof is beautiful.  I've not had a crazy sunny day yet, but light does not seem too much at all.  Tint is appropriate.  Sitting in the back seat gives you the best view of the openness and spacious feeling.  Great design element.\n\n\n**Exterior:**\n\n* Panels are all aligned perfectly.  No issues that I can see at all.\n\n* Paint / Colors / Finish seems perfect.  I really like the Midnight Silver Metallic - it has a great presence.\n\n* Door handles require some odd hand movements to open the car.  Push with your thumb, reach over and pull handle.  This may be something you just get used to, but it does not feel natural.  I appreciate the fact that they are flush with the door - but something isn't entirely fluid about the motions you need to open.\n\n* While I love the frunk/trunk - they should be automatic open on a car in this class.\n\n* Charging port is a great location, and is invisible when not in use - nice touch.  It does seem to be a little temperamental when it comes to opening with the charging handle.  I've only had about a 50% chance of it opening as I approach.  Perhaps I'm not doing it correctly yet.  Touch open/close works 100% of the time.\n\n\n**Driving:**\n\n* Handling - Amazing - like the car is driving on rails.  Tight steering makes the car feel very solid.  I've not gone into too many high speed turns yet, but from the few artificial hard turns, everything stays where it is supposed to.  Sway is minimal.\n\n* Acceleration - OMG - I'm used to the pickup and torque of an electric motor.  Been driving a Nissan Leaf for 6 years.  So, while I expected a difference, I didn't expect this.  I test drove an early RWD, and that was peppy.  This AWD is like a completely different animal altogether.  \n\n* Automatic Breaking / ReGen - This will take a bit getting used to.  Again, Leaf had something similar, but this is a 10x difference.  It goes very heavy on the brake when you let up on the accelerator fully.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, and re-calibrate my single-pedal feathering... but it was a shock.  Come to a light and let up... the car reacts quickly and slows you down.  I know there a other settings to minimize the braking, but I will leave it \"standard\" and see if I can learn the car.\n\n* Distance Sensing / Alerts seem to be a little too conservative for me.  It yells at me when pulling in the garage or backing out. I do understand that it senses distance, and it is surely accurate, but I ended up turning off the chime.  Visual indicator is fine.\n\n* Operation of the Console Display is actually quite easy while driving.  I had thought it would be difficult or distracting.  So far I've not really had issue with it yet.  Most of the settings - once perfected and on Auto - should be set-it-then-forget-it. \n\n* Approach Lock / Unlock is a great feature.  Have to get used to it a little, but I am certainly a fan of the feature.\n\n\nSo, that's it... let me know if you have any questions.\n",

      "title": "The Base Highland Sound System Is Perfectly Fine",
      "text": "I am happy to report back from a Tesla showroom that the Model 3 RWD base sound system is, in fact, best-in-class. \n\nI believe that it competes well with other sound systems in its segment, up to competing sedans/hatchbacks, and on first impression outdoes competitors like the BMW Hi-Fi and Audi base sound systems. \n\nFurthermore, it is on par with if not notably superior to premium audio options offered in the compact EV segment. It outshines the Harman Kardon system I had and loved in an i3, and also the Hyundai IONIQ. I used the joke that it ate the previous-generation Harman Kardon systems for lunch like Billie Eilish. Billie Eilish\u0019s music, which is now used as reference for tuning by audio brands due to the range and popularity of songs like \u001cBad Guy,\u001d shines on the system. \n\nThis isn\u0019t surprising since nine speakers isn\u0019t too far off of a typical 10-12 luxury base/premium audio system, and many modern systems rely on woofers in the door panels rather than a subwoofer to produce bass. Tesla Model 3 RWD has a confident, punchy bass response that extends down into some sub-frequencies without too dramatic of a roll off. Reports that Tesla highlights the midrange frequencies, which brings out clarity and definition in vocals and instruments, are accurate and make the system audiophile-tuned even at the lower bitrate of a service like Deezer. I can\u0019t wait to one day hear Hi-Fi streaming services on the Model 3. \n\nI may admittedly be incorrect on this next observation as I had only test drove both briefly, but I preferred it to a 2018 Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive where I couldn\u0019t get the impact and clarity I was looking for at higher volumes especially with the windows down\u0014Model 3 RWD had no issue with distortion up to its max volume of over 102dB. \n\nNow, the 17-speaker sound system on the 2024 Model 3 Long Rage All-Wheel Drive and Performance is as mind-blowing as the setup would imply: it is absolutely the highest quality of clean, tight, impactful bass I\u0019ve heard from a stock sound system with plenty of clarity and separation across the range. The dual woofers in the doors paired with the dual subwoofers gives the system even more of a \u001cwow\u001d effect that, paired with the rest of the mid-range speakers and tweeters, may outdo nearly every sound system in its class. \n\nI believe that Tesla is targeting a more bass-heavy response than before that places emphasis on the mid-range without making the treble shrill, which quite honestly matches my preference for audio. There was no lack of bass on the RWD, as I could feel my shorts vibrating with both systems; although, more so on the AWD since it has the subwoofers as well as an impressive two additional woofers. Even playing with the EQ makes for changes that seem deliberate rather than random. Tesla did an excellent job with both systems. \n\nThe base Model 3 \u0018Highland\u0019 sound system is perfectly fine, probably phenomenal even and outdoes most base systems from competitors if not many premium audio systems found on other vehicles and especially electric vehicles. Model 3 RWD would almost be too good of a value relative to the market if it had come with such an amazing 17-speaker system. A single subwoofer as Tesla had noted in its initial press release would have made the RWD system perfect; however, it\u0019s not necessarily missed due to the competent performance of the woofers that are there and the difference would be less dramatic between both systems.\n\nModel 3\u0019s premium audio system offered on All-Wheel-Drive/Performance models simply takes the audio experience to another level. It\u0019s like the difference between a Model S Long Range and a Model S Plaid: both will get you there in style and comfort, but only one is insane. To be fair, both systems can be considered premium whereas the complete 17-speaker system is Ludicrous. \n\nOne more note: extra speakers in the back can make the rear display experience better for rear passengers, but isn\u0019t really necessary since there are speakers already and Bluetooth headphones can be paired. \n\nTLDR: Model 3\u0019s RWD system deserves the recognitions of excellence it\u0019s received. Model 3 AWD/Performance takes the sound to Ludicrous levels. Customers should be happy with either option, and there isn\u0019t a need to upgrade due to any lack of quality or fullness in the base RWD system. Nonetheless, the premium for the AWD can be worth it to have one of the best sound systems on the market. ",

I\u0019m in the middle of a pretty long stretch of road between superchargers.

      "text": "Purchased my Model 3 in August 2019, and took delivery of my 2024 \"Highland\" on July 20th. My wife got a 2021 Model Y in September of that year. I'll make some comparisons to that where appropriate, but for the most part I want to talk about the differences between the two 3s and just my overall experience with the two.\n\n##Delivery Issues\n\nIt wouldn't be a Tesla without there being something wrong at delivery, right? In both cases, I didn't take a checklist. I didn't know to do so in 2019, and in 2024, I had a better idea of what to look for.\n\nThe 2019 had visible rim damage and both door jambs on the passenger side were unpainted. I took delivery with the promise that they would fix it.\n\nOn the drive home it sounded like I was hauling maracas and geiger counters. I had never heard of a car rattling as bad as this one. And from what I've heard in general, I probably got one of the worst.\n\nThe steering wheel was grossly off center. And over time, the interior panels developed issues. The panel on the driver side below the seat belt adjuster kept falling off. The front dash split horizontally behind the display. The trunk was misaligned to the point that closing it was damaging the interior weather stripping.\n\nSpeaking of weather stripping, it literally fell off the doors. In all, it took 12 appointments over 18 months to get me to \"screw it,\" and I learned to live with the remaining rattles. But most of the issues were resolved. They tried to tell me that the unpainted areas were \"within spec\" and in that moment I acted more like a Karen than I ever have in my life to that point or since. I wish I still had photos.\n\nNotice how I didn't say anything about panel gaps or paint quality issues (aside from the unpainted areas)? These are things that don't bother me unless blatantly obvious. Ignorance is truly bliss.\n\nMoving on to the 2024, I got there an hour early and the car was unlocked. So I did a full white-glove exterior and interior inspection. I was looking for obvious damage and marks, as well as other issues. I found none and, again, I don't know enough about paint quality to truly care. Is there a chance something's wrong? Yup. Will I ever notice? Probably not.\n\nIn the ~900 miles I've driven since (what can I say, I like this car), I've found three issues that I've since made an appointment for late next month:\n\n* with the steering wheel centered, the car pulls slightly but noticeably to the left. It's subtle.\n* There is a rattle in the driver side seatbelt adjuster when driving over uneven pavement. There are other rattles in the headliner, but it requires extremely bad pavement to hear. In ~900 miles I've heard it briefly twice. So I'm only asking them to fix the seatbelt adjuster, since that's a known issue and they are less likely to make things worse playing with that. If they go fishing around the headliner, things will get worse.\n* This one is petty and laughable. In our state, temporary tags are now card stock that gets screwed into the license plate holder rather than taped inside the rear window. A screw fell out. Another was about to. The three remaining were extremely loose. Whoever was setting up the temp tags decided to place the screws in the holes and not even hand tighten them. Sheer laziness. I only added this so they slap the person upside the head. And maybe get a free screw out of it, lol.\n\n##Ride Quality and Comfort\n\nWhile this section will be mostly positive, I think some of you will be overall disappointed by it (tire noise). But it is my honest opinion.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was that the suspension was...actually there? I always joked that the 2019 didn't even have a suspension. Like, I could drive over a dime and tell you if it was heads or tails. You feel EVERYTHING. But with the 2024, going over my community speed bumps, there's that tell tale \"bounce\" after you come down from the peak, which wasn't present on the 2019. When you'd see small divots, cracks, and those tar filler marks on pavement, you'd FEEL it in the 2019. Now? I wouldn't know if I hadn't seen it. It's that much improved.\n\nWind noise is...gone? Granted, I'm not on the highway much, but even at ~70mph I can't hear wind noise. And to be clear, my daughter is in the back with Disney Plus on with low rear-seat volume. All I've got are my thoughts, and it's still quiet. In the 2019, it always sounded like the windows were slightly cracked open, with wind rushing in. It's a huge and appreciable difference. It is at least as quiet as my wife's Y, maybe slightly more so.\n\nHowever, it's not perfect. It's not deadened against tire noise very well, for whatever reason. The stock 18\" Michelin Primacy tires that come with the car emit a noticeable growl over all but the smoothest pavement. It's hard to directly compare this to my 2019 as, at 95k miles, I had recently put it on its third set of tires. And because I was so fed up with its noise (I swear it was giving me hearing damage on the stock Conti ProContact RX 19\"), I had switched to Pirelli P Zero Elect All-Seasons, and those things were usually fairly quiet. Which is partly what they're tuned to do. So my 2024 is louder by comparison to THAT, but quieter than the first two sets I had on my 2019. Tires play a big role and, in 2-3 years, I'll probably go back to those unless something better comes along. The 2021 Model Y is, for reasons I do not know, quieter when it comes to tire noise. Maybe it's the tires. Maybe it's something else.\n\nOverall, the 2024 is a huge improvement in ride quality, comfort, and noise compared to the 2019, with only tire noise being a potential weak point.\n\n##Interior Fit and Finish\n\nRattles aside, I loved the interior of the Model 3. Yes, it was criticized for being minimal and using fake leather (and mine was among the first to ditch the leather steering wheel). Personally, I preferred the leather steering wheel but I didn't miss it. And I did prefer the PET-based faux leather seats as they were easier to clean and maintain. That's what I loved most about the interior, just how easy it was to clean.\n\nI was coming from a 2011 Ford Fusion and, to the touch, the Model 3's interior felt of superior quality. Before getting my 2024 Model 3 I did test drive three potential competitors. And in these areas, here's how all five stacked up.\n\n1. The BMW i4 had the best feeling interior and materials. And it should, because how I had it specced out, it came to $76k.\n2. The Polestar 2's interior materials felt like a tier below the BMW, but was still impressive feeling. And I'm putting the 2024 Model 3 here in a tie, which I didn't think would happen. From the door trim to the cloth-like dash material, to the greatly improved headliner (the 2019 headliner felt like paper mache and that it would fall or flake off), the fit and finish should not be a complaint anymore. Those who don't like minimalist designs due to preference, I get it. But the quality is there.\n3. This space intentionally left blank to highlight that the next cars aren't even close.\n4. My 2019 Model 3, as noted, was better than my Ford Fusion, but it didn't feel like a full tier up. There was a mix of solid soft-touch materials (door trim, dash) and questionable plastics (I've felt like if they added grab handles to the car, the headliner would come off).\n5. The Hyundai Ioniq 6 felt cheaper to me, with its flat and flimsy plastics. And there was one surface with a texture to it that caused sensory issues for me. Just made me shudder for some reason. The interior of that car made me write it off entirely. But, I've heard the build quality is better than Tesla, and I believe it. The Ioniq 6 is a great car and a top tier EV, it just wasn't for me.\n\nAnd the doors closing is just so much more satisfying on the refreshed 3 than the 2019 or even my wife's 2021 Model Y.\n\n##Features\n\nThere are plenty of Model 3 reviews out there, and this rambling post is already getting too darn long, so I'm going to focus on things that caught my attention for one reason or another, or things I haven't commonly seen in other reviews and videos.\n\nFor example, did you know it now has a proper blind spot indicator light? I had no idea! It's in the speakers in the front corner of the door, an obvious little red light. Caught me by surprise the first time I saw it. My wife's old 2011 Ford Edge had them in the mirrors and I never adjusted to them, but having them inside the car means you're taking your eyes off the road less. You can see them easily before you would even turn your head to look, saving you the trouble.\n\nThe lack of ultrasonic sensors (USS) was a partial disappointment. I do like that it makes the bumpers look cleaner. But I no longer get those \"18 inches until you wreck your car\" warnings. Instead it switches to a simulated overhead view, but the cameras don't quite have object permanence (dancing cars/road lines, for example), so this isn't trustworthy. So as a result, a couple of years after the change, we're still missing features like summon. And while I can live without the parking lot summon, the lack of nudging the car backward and forward sucks because that was an occasionally useful feature.\n\nThe rear display is very useful. You can change the fan settings from the back. The rear passenger side person can adjust the front passenger seat position. And you have limited control over media. My daughter loves to load Disney Plus and watch as I drive. Yes, you can watch movies or play games while in drive. When in park, you can mirror the rear display to the front to control it. My daughter has some disabilities, so at first I'd use this to set things up for her, but now she's got the hang of it and my radio is gone :)\n\nOne thing we don't typically hear about is USB port power. Each of the three USB-C ports (1x under armrest, 2x under rear display) can deliver 42W by themselves, and I believe the two in the rear are on 65W shared. I tested a Steam Deck on each of the ports and it works at full power with pass-through perfectly.\n\nAnother thing is the heat pump. While it's seen as an overall positive from an efficiency perspective, I've found that I miss the old resistive setup. It was louder, sure, but it heated and cooled the car quickly. By comparison, I've found that the heat pump struggles to keep up on warmer days, like the ones we've had lately.\n\nNow, let's talk about the stalks and steering wheel buttons, because that's what most people want to hear opinions on.\n\nThe lack of stalks is both the worst way of implementing gear shift and turn signals ever, and simultaneously totally livable. You can adjust to it, and you'll be fine.\n\nWith gear-shifting, you have three options.\n\n1. There are capacitive buttons next to the hazard lights above the mirror. Touch the area to have them light up.\n2. Press the brake and, left side of the screen, you'll see a mini car sitting on Park. Slide up for drive, down for reverse.\n3. (Optionally) You can enable auto shift from park where it will use the cameras to choose between drive and reverse when you press the brake with your seatbelt on. This won't automatically shift when you brake while in gear, such as a Gus-from-Psych-34-point-turn, only the initial shift out of park.\n\nTo place the vehicle in park, you can press the button near the hazard lights, or tap/hold the park icon on the display's gear selector. If you're pressing the brake, you just need to tap the icon. If your foot is off the brake, you'll need to hold the icon for a second or two.\n\nAnd turn signals...Like many, I thought they were physical buttons. They are not. Like the iPhone's redesigned home \"button\" years ago, it's a capacitive area with haptics behind it to simulate a button press. And when it fails (which has happened to me twice so far), you realize that it doesn't actually press in at all, aside from typical plastic flex.\n\nThe right turn signal is on the top, and the left on the bottom, to simulate pressing the stalk up for right and down for left. There's a slight plastic bump between them to help you feel the difference. And this is important because this is where I began to realize that they were capacitive. I would rest my thumb over both signals, and press with the top of my thumb for right and bottom for left, except it always went right. Why? While I pressed below the bump, physically, most of my thumb was touching above the bump. So it read the press as being from there. As a result, I have to be more deliberate with my presses.\n\nOn the left side of the wheel, there are three \"buttons\" next to the scroll wheel. They are:\n\n1. Right turn signal (top)\n2. Left turn signal (bottom)\n3. High beams (inside)\n\nFor some reason I still struggle to use the high beams button without looking at it. In those cases I accidentally turn on a turn signal.\n\nOn the right side of the wheel you have:\n\n1. Windshield wipers (top)\n2. Mic (bottom, formerly the scroll wheel, which now does AP/FSD).\n3. Backup camera toggle (inside)\n\nAnd here's a problem that I have. The windshield wipers are on the right side but, when pressed, you use the left scroll wheel to adjust their speed. To me this is counter intuitive. Instead, I think the left turn signal should move up, the right turn signal to the windshield wiper spot, and the wipers control down where the left turn signal is. This would put the turn signals on both sides in symmetrical places, which to me is more intuitive. And the wiper button would be next to the scroll wheel that it uses, which to me is also more intuitive.\n\n##Conclusion\n\nThere's too much to cover for a Reddit post, so I'll answer any questions from those who are curious. But my conclusion is that the 2024 Model 3 is a greatly improved refresh of the prior Model 3. And to me, it's a full refresh, not a mid-cycle change. Aside from a couple of potential regressions (removed USS and stalks), Tesla has thoughtfully improved nearly everything on the car. If you're just jumping in now, I think it's the superior alternative between it and the Hyundai Ionic 6. If you already have a Model 3, once you've reached your personal threshold for age, miles, or any other excuse you can fathom, it's a solid upgrade.\n\n##Accessories\n\nI'm not going to go on and on about every accessory that I got for the car, just a couple highlights. NOTE: Links are for illustrative purpose and are not referral links. I get nothing for it.\n\n1. [THESE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWRVJY7C) door storage covers are a godsend. When I test drove the new Model 3, my chief complaint was that awful carpet-like material inside the door storage. To me, it's like carpet in a bathroom. I have kids and kids are disgusting. These completely cover it up and install easily. An absolute necessity, IMO.\n2. [Sticking with Amazon,](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPPK8CL2) the BASENOR trunk organizers are better than the official Tesla options. They have covers that match the trunk liner and are level with it. They're small, of course, and do slightly reduce the already small storage areas. But if you want those areas covered for any reason, these work.\n3. The [JOWUA LED Hub](https://www.jowua-life.com/products/130w-led-hub-reengineered-model-3-highland) is another absolute necessity, IMO, if you want more connectivity. This hub plugs into the cigarette lighter and gives up to 130W over 4 ports (2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, and a built-in retractable USB-C cable). The light is borderline useless, but the ports are great.",

      "title": "Day One Reservation Holder Finally Takes Delivery of Standard Range+ Model 3. Here\u0019s Some Advice",
      "text": "On March 31st 2016 I stood in line at a Tesla store in St. Louis, Missouri to place a $1,000 deposit for the new Tesla Model 3. Literally had no idea what it even looked like nor knew anything about its specs. All I knew is that it would be a game changer like its predecessor. Later that evening it was revealed via live stream. And I knew I would eventually own one. It became my dream car. \n\nFast forward a few years, through the typical ups and downs of adulting, and here I am in September of 2019 owning my dream car. \n\nThis is for anyone ordering who\u0019d like tips for the whole process -&gt;\n\n- Wait until the last month of the quarter (preferably until the 15th of the month) to order a new Tesla. Time and time again folks who order during the last month of the quarter get end of quarter incentives of some sort. this quarter its two free years of supercharging. \n- Use a referral code to gain free Supercharging Miles. You have to put this in before placing the order. Shameless Plug. Here\u0019s a link of a separate subreddit post to mine -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/teslareferralcode/comments/d7mjqm/day_one_model_3_reservation_holder_here_use_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n- Use a credit card that you can gain points with  to place the $2,500 order. As a day one res holder I was able to charge the original $1,000 deposit to one of my chase cards. the additional $2,500 for the order was eligible too. Meaning $3,500 worth of charges and free points. Might as well right? \n- Always talk to a Sales Advisor before ordering. By calling one, building the order, and making the order on my phone with him on speaker (using Apple Pay on Tesla\u0019 website for the $2,500 charge made me happy to just live in this age) allowed for him to immediately match me with a new inventory vehicle in route to the service center. Talking to someone is always the best option. Perhaps not the norm, but I only waited 6 days for delivery after placing the order. \n- if you\u0019re getting a loan, check with your credit unions after placing the order. I here Navy Federal is pretty damn good but there are many others out there that offer very low rates. \n- Always check Tesla\u0019s rate match option after receiving a loan from an alternate source. Going through Tesla for the loan is remarkably seamless but I\u0019d assume they stick to their higher rates unless checked. Go through these steps for the rate match -&gt; https://www.tesla.com/support/rate-match-guarantee\n- Use Progressive for Auto Insurance. They have the best rates for Model 3\u0019s by far. This is subject to change of course (perhaps even when Tesla Insurance spreads to states other than just California). But present day Progressive has the best pricing. \n- The remaining amount due (sales tax, other fees and such)  can be paid before delivery on Tesla\u0019s website but I believe it only goes live for payment 48 hours or 24 hours before delivery. This time only direct payment made via bank account is allowed. No credit cards for additional points accrual :/. Do this instead of paying via personal check on delivery day. Keeps things seamless and expedites delivery. \n- Order accessories to protect and make the Model 3 experience that much more enjoyable. Definitely recommend all weather floor liners, Damn near anything that makes you giddy on Abstract Ocean (their screen protectors and center console liners are amazing) and the XBox 360 Wired USB controller (to pass the time by with Arcade games while Supercharging. Emphasis on Wired. Wireless controllers do not currently work). Here\u0019s a list of accessories I purchased. I\u0019m still waiting for most to be shipped so it might be best to order these before you order the car if you want to have them all ready for install from day 1 -&gt; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10yoWpRzsDmqWWf0jB2b_dh--aQPrbeHvxAac1QXRhwM\n- If you don\u0019t already have a Level 2 240V Charger installed, be sure to get one installed in your garage or parking spot. It makes EV ownership a breeze and tbh trickle charging from a regular 120V outlet is outlandishly slow. Tesla\u0019s wall connector seems like a great option for fastest Level 2 charging. \n- Download the Tesla App before delivery. On delivery day it\u0019ll literally only take seconds for the app to be enabled for access to your new Model 3. \n- Download the Plugshare App just to get an idea of all the Level 2 charging options around. Plugshare has the best overall outline of all the ev charger networks and charging locations. \n- Download the Chargepoint App and make an account. Chargepoint is everywhere and a decent quantity of locations offer free level 2 charging. I use the chargepoint card in Apple Wallet for simplicity. \n- On delivery get your new Model 3 and live your best life as a Tesla Owner! \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Hope to see more Tesla\u0019s on the road.",

      "title": "The One Month Review: Philly Suburbs Edition",
      "text": "So after the first month of owning my Model 3 (SR) in southeastern Pennsylvania, I've already learned quite a few useful tidbits of information about the car itself and its various post-delivery needs. Since some of these things include issues without immediate answers, If figured I'd share my experience for others living in our Tesla-heavy area who haven't yet taken delivery or for those who find other people writing about familiar surroundings enjoyable.\n\n**Pre-Delivery**: So between my initial order and my delivery, I moved from the D.C.-area back to PA. Of course, this was a very stupid move planning-wise for me, as it made the entire delivery process much more complicated than it needed to be. ***DO NOT*** do this if your estimated delivery is in the same general timeframe as your move. I was told, rather explicitly, by my Sales Rep (SA) that I couldn't take delivery of a vehicle with a PA license in Virginia, despite being told the opposite by a salesperson at the Tesla store I purchased from. Thankfully, I had ordered in the store with said SA, and so changing delivery sites was relatively straightforward. Additionally, I needed to update information such as my new Drivers License and Insurance, which I chose to do instead at the Devon location shortly after getting those things. If you're doing this same boneheaded process, I'd recommend just going to a Tesla store to do it instead of talking over the phone.\n\nOther assorted pre-delivery tidbits:\n\n* Carvana gave me an absolute fortune for my previous vehicle. Granted, it was in excellent condition and had low mileage, but thanks to the used car market, I got about 50% more than Kelly Blue Book had quoted me on. Very smooth process selling the car, and I chose to do so before moving to avoid PA's [very dumb vehicle registration process for new residents](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/New-Resident-Relocation-Information/New%20Residents/Pages/Motor-Vehicle-Information-for-New-Residents.aspx) and the associated fees.\n\n* If you do a test drive, I'd highly suggest a route between the Devon and KoP stores. Its a good mix of highway traffic along a short stretch of 202, as well as the type of residential and multi-lane roads you're probably used to driving during your normal routine. Even if you've already ordered a car, I'd strongly recommend doing it if you haven't already to get a feel for how it handles so your first experiences with regen braking aren't in a crowded parking lot with lots of other cars.\n\n**Delivery Day**: While there was some slight panel misalignment and and a few other small cosmetic issues, the delivery was an extremely smooth process. Minus my detailed inspection of the car and personalizing the interface, the total time spent doing paperwork and waiting was approximately 15 minutes. One important thing to note about the Devon location is that it had virtually no parking available. I was thankfully able to get a spot, but I'm pretty sure it was the last one available. Also important to know is that there is only parking on the east side of the service center, the other side appears to be strictly for inventory and was packed to the brim with wrapped up cars awaiting future delivery.\n\n**Post-Delivery**: For PA, there are some interesting things in the immediate post-delivery timeframe that are good to know ahead of time. These include:\n\n* Tesla's PA Service Centers aren't certified for State Inspections. While you'll be provided with a permanent license plate and temp registration on-site, you will need to get the car state inspected within the first two weeks. Schedule this ahead of time. Even more frustrating is that the Model 3, like other Teslas, has special jacking requirements due to the battery underneath. Many traditional auto-repair centers can't/won't service the car because of this, and you should be very cautious about where you take it to ensure your car isn't poorly handled like [/u/bbtow69's poor car was](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/npudzg/is_this_lifted_incorrectly/). Check out this [old Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bxgage/state_inspection_near_devon_pa_service_center/) for some helpful recommendations. The good news (I guess) is that [PA doesn't require an emissions test of electric vehicles](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvspubsforms/BMV/BMV%20Safety%20Inspection%20Bulletins/Safety_Bulletin_BI14-1.pdf).\n\n* If you have the (dis)pleasure of living under PECO's incompetence, they offer you [a whole $50 rebate](https://pecorebateportal.com/electric-vehicles/smart-driver-rebate.html) for your trouble. I'd say go spend it on Phillies tickets, but you should definitely spend it on a [paint repair kit](https://shop.tesla.com/product/paint-repair-kit) instead to cover for [PennDot's mismanagement](https://i.redd.it/576otwicf1t21.jpg) of our roads. More on the *pain* repair kit later.\n\n* Another important note regarding PECO are its peak/off-peak hours. For 2021, the [Super Off-peak hours are Midnight to 6AM, and Peak hours are from 2PM-6PM on weekdays](https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-peco-default-service-tou-rates-time-of-use-20201204.html). A standard rate applies during all other times. **EDIT** This rate does not yet apply, but a plan was proposed and approved in December 2020.\n\n* The Commonwealth itself offers a more substantial BEV incentive of [$750 for new or used vehicles under $50k](https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/grantsloansrebates/alternative-fuels-incentive-grant/pages/alternative-fuel-vehicles.aspx). This is a grant and is not tied to tax returns. However, it's first come, first serve, so get it while you can!\n\n* I had some slight panel misalignment and the plastic trim attached to my passenger-side mirror coming off, noted to the sales rep on delivery day. I didn't realize it, but you also need to separately file a service ticket through the app for this. They ultimately sent out a mobile service tech to fix both, and it was covered under warranty. It took a few weeks to get them out there, so I'd recommend filing the  service ticket on delivery day as soon as you get home.\n\n**The Driving Experience**: So this is (obviously) the best part of owning the car. Here's what I've learned while driving around the area:\n\n* Driving the car with full regen braking is incredibly fun along the winding curves of our area. It feels like a sports car, both in the comfort of the ride and the handling. One pedal driving is especially useful for close curves and hills, and it feels like you have far more control over the vehicle. Because our roads are [a bit special](https://i.redd.it/ypl9rt8y7h571.jpg), you'll likely notice the ride is a bit more bumpy due to the steel spring suspension of the Model 3. While this may be a deal-breaker for those used to a super smooth ride in a luxury vehicle, I've found it to be fine and gives the ride a bit more \"texture\" without the vibration of an ICE engine in front of you. It's simply more noticeable due to the bumpiness of the roads around here, and the potholes can be a bit unnerving. Overall, the car handled these like a champ, and I feel much more in control of my car when driving than I ever did its AWD predecessor. I've heard that potholes can be pretty dangerous for the 19\" and 20\" wheels, so definitely try to avoid those if possible.\n\n* I'd also recommend setting the car to creep or roll for the first hundred miles or so if you aren't used to driving with strong regen braking, as the transition is a bit difficult. Also good to know is that regen braking applies the tail lights at a certain braking threshold, so don't be paranoid like I was and assume you need to apply the brakes as well to avoid getting rear-ended. After you're used to the creep or roll, the transition to \"hold\" will be very smooth and is highly recommended to extend your range.\n\n* Autopilot will work on virtually any road with a median lane marker. Despite actively following Tesla development for nearly a decade, I was under the impression that AP functionality was geofenced to major interstates. Not true. It works on many roads, including rural \"highways\" such as Route 1, but keep in mind that it **will not** stop for stop lights and stop signs like FSD is supposed to. For Route 1 in particular, I wasn't quite ready to let the car handle the high-speed, blind curves around the MD border, so I switched over to manual and had some fun doing the legal speed limit of *55MPH* and still feeling like I'm going too fast. Speaking of country roads, my first major autopilot \"freak out\" occurred when passing an Amish Buggy. While driving on AP, the car saw the Buggy on the right and an oncoming car on the left, and as I drew closer, promptly threw a temper tantrum and kicked me out of AP. Thankfully, I was assuming that the Buggy might cause issues and was already in the process of switching over to manual control. On a later drive through this route without a buggy or oncoming traffic, I discovered that this particular area of road is a hotspot for Phantom Braking, so ultimately it was double-whammy of events. Overall, proceed with the regular amount of caution as you normally would for a buggy.\n\n* I had the joy to discover in late-May that [Tesla had made some important changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31HaTbWONmQ) to my vehicles components after ordering, and would be taking delivery of Tesla-vision vehicle without lumbar support. Outside of my test drive Model 3, I've not had any experiences with a radar-equipped M3, but what I can say is that I've felt quite confident in its ability function in clear conditions. I was also pretty happy to see that the car was receiving updates last week, and appreciated some of the other QOL changes such as the ability to toggle off the auto-brights during autosteer. I'd still prefer being able to outright disable the auto-brights given how bad they are at detection on highways, but for now I think I can deal with the current setup. The lumbar support omission hasn't been much of an issue to my passengers, however I'm still pretty annoyed about the situation.\n\n**Accessories and Other Tidbits**:\n\n* Since we live in a region with, ahem, *Four Seasons*, you'll definitely want to purchase [Splash Guards/Mud Flaps](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-mud-flaps) for your car to [protect the notably poor quality paint](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/55412/tesla-model-3-s-paint-problem-has-a-solution-now/) from salt and gravel spray. It's also recommended to purchase the PPF, but I forgot to add it to my cart that day and can't give a review for it. What I can give a review for are the splash guards and optional mud flaps. The flaps themselves are detachable and hang only about an inch and a half from the ground. I strongly recommend that you don't attach these, as they scrapped along the ground during turns. I have absolutely no idea how Tesla thought these were acceptable to sell to consumers at their current length, but I guess that's what I get for buying a car designed in always sunny, always summer California. The installation process was pretty easy, the only tools needed are a ratchet wrench fitted with a 10MM Hex attachment and a screwdriver to remove the pins on the wheel wells. It took about 20 minutes total to install both, and I'd recommend installing them as soon as you can after deliver to protect from any debris you kick up while driving.\n\n* If you're getting the SR+, the car somehow doesn't come with floor mats despite being a $40K vehicle. Given how many aftermarket floor mats are available, there are a lot of options to choose from. I can't really give a review for the ones I purchased, as I've only had them a month, but I can say you have a wide variety of options to choose from. You'll definitely want to buy something though to protect the car's interior carpet from mud, dirt and basically anything else.\n\n* I purchased a screen protector for my display from [Spigen](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-Designed/dp/B084BNC3FG/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2L662REOLO0LC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=spigen+tesla+model+3+screen+protector&amp;qid=1623845582&amp;sprefix=spigen+tesla%2Caps%2C147&amp;sr=8-2), and it's working pretty well so far. Installation was easy, and the matte anti-glare is largely unnoticeable but protects from smudging.\n\n* Having gotten many dings and scrapes on my previous car in public garages, I decided to purchase a paint repair kit in case it was needed. Frustratingly, in the very first week of ownership, I needed it. I'm not sure how it happened, but at some point my tire  kicked up a piece of debris with enough force that the edge of my rocker around the wheel well was bent-in to the extent that the paint split along a small section around the edge of the rocker where the side meets the wheel well. No matter the cause, the paint repair kit rather was relatively easy to use after watching a number of guides, with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FC0xCixhU0) being the best I could find. A good reason to install the guards as soon as you can, as it presumably would have prevented this damage.\n\n\n* I originally purchased [Silver RIMETRIX Orbitals](https://rimetrix.com/product/orbital-silver/) for my car because I wanted something a bit more flashy than the aero wheels. The plan was to buy them, then coat them with Duplicolor [Hyper Silver](https://www.duplicolor.com/product/hyper-silver-coating/) to give them a metallic finish that would reduce their plastics look. After owning the car for a few weeks, I actually found the Aeros to look just fine and cancelled my order. I may come back to the orbitals, but for now I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite dreaming of owning a Tesla for nearly a decade and following them very closely since the early Model S days, I started to get cold feet as delivery day approached and the Tesla vision announcement was made. I wound up taking delivery anyway, and I'm incredible happy that I did. The car handles exceptionally, is very intuitive to use, and most importantly, I just love looking at it and knowing its all mine. If you're in the same spot that I was, I hope this review gives you a bit more insight into a number of steps in this process, as well as some of the quirks and benefits of owning a Tesla in our area. If anyone has any additional comments or insights, please comment them below so that some wayward google searcher in need of advice can be informed three years from now!",

      "title": "Excessive \"vehicle standby\" battery drain?",
      "text": "Recently my 2022 Tesla Model 3 LR has been experiencing, what I believe to be, excessive battery drain while the car is parked and not in use. There are periods of time where I do not drive my car for a few days and it just sits there unplugged and with sentry mode turned off. When I first got the car I had sentry mode turned on at all times, but would notice roughly 3% battery drain per day (presumably due to sentry mode). Once I turned off sentry, this battery drain was reduced significantly to less than 1% per day. However, recently I've noticed significant battery drain, to the tune of roughly 0.2% per hour. Thanks to the recent Tesla software update, I'm able to see that the consumption is coming from the \"vehicle standby\" section, as seen in the image attached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[10.2&amp;#37; battery drain over a 51 hour period of car being parked without sentry mode nor opening the Tesla app on my phone](https://preview.redd.it/i00o7smx174a1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28fa2cc50eda41c86b9b40b0a427fe9ea465670)\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this as well? If so, does anyone have a solution? I find Tesla's solution of \"reduce energy loss while parked by keeping Model3 plugged in\" to be laughable. That is not a solution at all. The real solution is to figure out what in your software is causing this to happen as there was little to no battery drain for a good few months before I recently started to notice this issue. I'm assuming it's a recent software update that has introduced a bug because I only noticed this issue in the last 2 weeks and I've had the car for a little over 2 months where this issue was not present. For reference, I'm in southern California and low temperatures of around 50F where I live.\n\nI just find it crazy that the car was able to sit in park for roughly 51 hours with sentry mode OFF and still drain the battery as much as driving 30-35 miles would.  \n\n\nEdit : After a bit of research, I found a post talking about how many users have reported an issue where after a software update the car wouldn't be able to go into sleep mode. The solution was to hard restart the car, which I've now done and will report back results in a few days. \n\nDecember 11, 2022 update:\nEither a recent software update I installed several days ago or car reboot did the trick as now the vehicle standby battery consumption is back to normal of around -0.35% per 24 hours.",

      "text": "[https://i.imgur.com/haFKNhQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/haFKNhQ.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1gc2jhl8c351.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdac288a88f0528b24c033364bfa0b4770060ea\n\n[Additional images](https://imgur.com/a/dYYFjdU)\n\nSubwoofer Specs: JL Audio MicroSub+ ACP112LG-TW1 12\" Slot Ported Subwoofer Enclosure with integrated amplifier providing 400 W @ 0.25 ©\n\n**Why did you upgrade?**\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 premium audio system is very good. It\u0019s a 15 speaker system with subwoofer. I previously owned a 2018 Model 3 and it was \u001cgood enough\u001d to where I never considered upgrading it. But the 2020 Model 3s replaced a large \u001cvent\u001d on the rear deck with a sealed metal rear deck and the bass response from the 6.5\u001d OEM subwoofer was sadly impacted from this change. This small change (along with pandemic boredom) were enough for me to decide I \u001cneed\u001d this. Also, mutually exclusive of the rear deck vent, the OEM subwoofer can\u0019t produce anything below 40Hz. It still sounds great but if you know your music well, there are many songs that are missing many sounds and you easily notice it.\n\n**How to install a subwoofer in a Model 3**\n\nFirst off... a huge thank you to Travis Llado who wrote an [incredibly thorough write up](https://www.travisllado.com/2019/05/tesla-model-3-stereo-part-9-summary-and.html) on the Tesla Model 3 audio and electrical system. I won\u0019t go too much into detail on installation details because his write-up is amazing and contains everything you need to know. But in summary, I tapped into the 12V power source underneath the rear seat bench and also tapped into the subwoofer speaker outputs from the OEM amplifier which provide the high-level inputs and remote turn-on signal for the JL subwoofer. I didn\u0019t install the solid-state relay or 100W/1© resistor as Travis and I think/hope the JL Audio\u0019s efficient Class D power load should be ok. If I encounter any issues I\u0019ll add those pieces.\n\n**Why the JL Audio Microsub?**\n\nI purchased the [JL Audio 12\u001d MicroSub+](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/acp112lg-tw1-car-audio-microsub-amplified-subwoofer-systems-93333) from Craigslist. I thought it was the smaller PowerWedge+ sealed box but it turned out to be the larger ported MicroSub+... but luckily that still fit perfectly into my car\u0019s lower \u001csub trunk\u001d (with slight alteration to the formed carpet as it\u0019s designed inefficiently with about 2\u001d of gap on all sides as the sub trunk pocket tapers inward as it goes down. The 10\u001d version of the MicroSub+ or the 12\u001d sealed PowerWedge+ would easily fit without modification. I don\u0019t have skills to build my own box and my buddy who normally builds custom fiberglass enclosures for me is currently too busy to help me at this time. I\u0019ve had JL Audio before in previous vehicles and know/trust the brand. Because of this, I didn\u0019t really look into any other brands for a subwoofer enclosure. In JL Audio I trust!\n\n**How much did it cost?**\n\nI found a great local Craigslist deal on the JL MicroSub+ at $350 cash. I did have to get a replacement [cable connector](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/acp-acs-pp-ca-rp-car-audio-microsub-amplified-subwoofer-systems-48031) and a new subwoofer [speaker grill](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/sgr-12tw1-car-audio-subwoofer-grilles-492177) since his was rather beaten up when I picked up the box. The cable connectors are great because with simple quick disconnects, the whole unit comes out of the car for times when I need the storage space. So for $395, I was able to acquire a \u001clike brand new\u001d sub that normally costs $630!\n\n**How does the JL MicroSub+ sound?**\n\nBoy is it loud! At first, being excited about having a big powerful subwoofer, I had the gain set to about 50% and the crossover set to 80Hz. That was way too high and now it\u0019s the gain is set to 20% and sounds much more balanced and musical.\n\nThe subwoofer hits quite low and hits hard. Bass heavy/forward music like Dr. Dre, Two Feet (check [Two Feet](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3dt6lj?si=_wF23BssRfmaK8Ww2WYbcg) out, so good), Elohim and Michael Jackson are quite impressive and sounds as they should, if not too much bass if anything.\n\nMore critical listening tracks like Jennifer Warnes\u0019 \u001cBird On A Wire\u001d still sound great and the subwoofer doesn\u0019t overpower or get in the way of the music at all. It\u0019s almost surprising since the \u001cbass heavy\u001d music is incredibly bass-y.\n\nNormal music that I listen to... The Cure, New Order, Rush and Echo and the Bunnymen sound just as they should. Clean mid bass which the Tesla already did well but much stronger kick drums and fuller sound.\n\nI may add JL\u0019s remote bass control knob after listening to it \u001cas is\u001d for the next couple of weeks but for now I think I can go without it as I\u0019m very happy with how it\u0019s sounding over the last 2 days.\n\nI also had planned to swap out the front 7\u001d woofers, 4\u001d midrange and tweeters to Focal components but I think I\u0019m super satisfied with just the subwoofer upgrade and will consider this chapter done. But this ain\u0019t my first rodeo so who knows, LOL.\n\nAlso, thank you to everyone on this sub-Reddit for answering questions I had over the past few weeks as I have been deciding which path to take.",

      "title": "Neighbor claiming i damaged his charging port (Tesla Model3)",
      "text": " I live in an apartment complex that has several Blink chargers in the parking garage. About two weeks ago I pulled into the charging area which was fully occupied, but noticed a charger was not active based on the color of the Blink station, which upon reading, the station flashed across the screen that the charge was complete. Being curious and thinking it was not a big deal, I checked the charger to see if it would release since the station was not active. The charger released without any resistance, so I took the charger and plugged it into my EV (not a Tesla). Would note here that I started a new charging session which was billed to my account. I note that the Tesla had an adapter, which after doing some research, appears not to lock, which I guess is why it unlatched without issue (*irrespective of whether car is charging still or not, which again, I note it was not*).\n\nFast forward, I received a message from my apartment manager saying that I removed the charger and in doing so (based on what was communicated by the Tesla owner) caused damage to the vehicle that the owner 'already had to repair' and them noting that there was also more damage done to the car as well. Fairly shocked, I shared my information, hoping to clarify with the neighbor that I did not remove his charger with malice, noting the fact pattern above.\n\nThe tenant subsequently reached out saying that the charging port of his car was 'forcefully detached, compromising the vehicle's integrity and its ability to retain a charge', and is threatening legal charges and has apparently filed a police report (with the police advising that we attempt to resolve the matter amicably before proceeding). I clearly did not 'forcefully detach' the charger, so am curious as to why this guy is making false claims or if he's simply trying to get me to pay for previous damages to his car. He's sent me a diagnostic summary from Tesla claiming damages of \\~$900.\n\nI will be seeking a consultation with a lawyer on the merits of any charges, but my question to fellow redditors here is whether this is even possible to damage a vehicle this way or if he's blowing this out of proportion. I am a man of integrity and would like to resolve this peacefully and if I really did make an error on my part, reasonably would pay for his damage and inconvenience, but not trying to be taken advantage of here. My wife was with me at the time of the 'incident' and would corroborate the fact that I didn't forcefully remove his charger.\n\n*I know that we can argue the merits of whether or not one should remove a charger or not from an idle vehicle, but this is not the purpose of my post. This was my first time doing this (which clearly won't be doing again in the future to save myself the brain damage of an owner like this regardless of whether it's true that i caused the damage or not).*",

      "title": "Hello and Goodbye to my Brand New Model 3 SR+",
      "text": "**TL;DR** \n\nMy Model 3 became undrivable at just under 48 hours of ownership and 409 miles. Roadside towed it 3.5 hours away to the closest service center. Service center reconnected high voltage wires and replaced 12v battery. Replaced Windshield that was also defective. Service won't deliver it back to me in OKC. Car now works. Tesla CS not great. Keeping Car. Much Wow. \n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a whirlwind of a not even 48 hours since taking delivery of my brand new 2020 Model 3 SR+. I've experienced all the emotions from pure excitement/bliss to anger/frustration over the course of these 48 hours.\n\nI drove up from OKC to Kansas City on Saturday to take delivery. I figured it'd be a great experience getting used to the car, testing out the supercharging network, etc.\n\nThe journey begins with driving the vehicle off the lot. Immediately after getting onto the road, I noticed what I can only explain as a distortion in the front windshield. I chalked it up to my sunglasses having a smudge or just needing to get acclimated to the giant front windshield and the curve of it. About an hour into my trip home however, as i'm readjusting my position in the car to get more comfortable, I notice that this distortion is really only occurring right at the driver eye level. Figured as soon as I got home i'd schedule a mobile service appointment to get the glass taken care of.\n\nAt about the 150 mile in, the real fun began. I was pulling off of the highway to the supercharger in emporia, where the vehicle flashed a message 'Vehicle may not restart, Service is required message'. It stayed on the screen for about 30 seconds, then disappeared.. not to be seen again for the rest of the trip home.\n\nSunday was fine, only annoyed by the glass. Drove it around locally for maybe 20 miles with no issue and no messages on the dash.\n\nToday (Monday) rolled around and the ominous 'Vehicle May not Restart. Service Required' message appeared again. This time not going away, I decided to park and call Tesla Roadside to troubleshoot. Since the vehicle technically was still drivable, I went through the 'non-emergency' phone tree while parked and sat on hold. About 15 minutes into hold, the vehicle made a loud 'clunk', shut off and a new message appeared stating 'Electrical System power reduced. Vehicle may shut down unexpectedly' .\n\nAt this point the car was no longer drivable. Would not power up. I called Roadside back on the 'emergency line' and immediately after looking at the error they dispatched a tow truck to bring it to the Dallas service center 3.5 hours away.\n\nSo within 48 hours and only 409 miles on the car i'm already saying goodbye to my new model 3.\n\nIf i'm being honest, i'm pretty bummed. I've lived vicariously through you all for years! I realize this isn't a typical experience, but regardless it's not been a great one so far.\n\nI'll keep you guys posted along the journey to repair or return. I've also reached out to my Delivery Support Specialist, but haven't heard back yet (to be fair it's only been about an hour since my call). Ultimately I know I have options, including the drastic measure of returning the vehicle since we're well within the 7 day and 1,000 mile window.\n\nInterested in hearing your thoughts/opinions/suggestions or if anyone else has shared a similar experience so early into ownership.\n\nBe well.\n\n\\------\n\n# UPDATE 8/11 (AM)\n\nTesla Roadside dispatched a tow truck from Dallas. The truck arrived four hours after my call to roadside.\n\nI was able to connect with my delivery support specialist and he was super understanding. Mentioned escalating the issue to the delivery team in Kansas City at around 1pm yesterday, but I haven\u0019t yet heard from them.\n\nShortly after the truck was in-route back to Dallas I received an automated text from Tesla Service:\n\n&gt;Hello! This is Tesla Service. Loaner vehicles are subject to availability at check-in. If unavailable, Uber credits will be provided upon request. Any other alternate transportation would be at owner's expense.\n\nI understand this is an automated message, but it\u0019s slightly confusing/unaccommodating, given the situation. Soo did I just check-in to my appointment? Do I have to drive to Dallas to get a loaner? The process seems a bit fragmented for someone not close to a service center. I\u0019m not reading too much into this message at this point since I haven\u0019t talked to a human at Dallas Service or Kansas City Delivery.\n\nReceived a text from the tow company at 9pm that the vehicle had been dropped off at Tesla service.\n\nAt 11:30pm I received an automated email saying that parts had been ordered for my vehicle.\n\nASY,12V BATT AND VENT PLUG,M3 Part #: 1129182-00-B\n\nI\u0019m curious if this part order was automatically generated because the battery died (I can no longer connect to vehicle via tesla app). Or if a tech was genuinely looking at the vehicle at 11:30pm\n\nThe email also stated an appointment was scheduled for 11:56pm CT (yes pm). (I doubt that\u0019s a real scheduled appointment time.. but we\u0019ll see)\n\n# UPDATE 8/11 (PM)\n\nDiagnosis will not be completed until tomorrow (8/12) . At that point there should be some sort of ETA on repair. The Delivery Team in KC helped coordinate with Dallas service on a rental vehicle from a local rental car agency in the meantime. I also inquired about an exchange of the vehicle (still a little ahead of myself here, not knowing what the issue is but also wanted to see what my options were) and this was the response:\n\n&gt;If you do wish to proceed with returning your Model 3 we can have our Dallas team process that. Refunds typically take 14-30 days and we unfortunately won\u0019t be able to \u001cswap\u001d another Model 3 with yours(and you\u0019ll unfortunately have to wait 12 months before ordering the same Model 3 trim).\n\nI understand the reason for the rule (discourage abuse of policy as 'rental' vehicle, asking for a swap for minor cosmetic issues, etc, but it also seems odd in a scenario such as this to essentially ban a real customer who just wants a car of the same trim level that drives...\n\n# UPDATE 8/12 (AM)\n\nI haven't received any formal updates from Tesla yet this morning, but I can now connect to the vehicle via the mobile app (was not able to do that once the vehicle died).\n\nTelsa also provided me with a rental vehicle here in OKC in lieu of Uber Credits, which I picked up this AM.\n\n# UPDATE 8/13 (PM)\n\nWas contacted by the Plano, TX Service center to let me know they found the root cause of the issue. A connector in the high-voltage loop was not securely fastened from the factory. They reattached/secured it as well as checked all other connections at the front of the vehicle. \n\nBecause the high voltage loop shut off for safety, it sounds like the 12v also died at some point in transport and they also replaced that.\n\nAside from that, they did a diagnostic on the windshield and confirmed a manufacturing defect... and did a full replacement.\n\nMy Model 3 is now ready for pickup.. yes pickup.. Unfortunately I wrongly assumed they'd be delivering it back to me here in OKC. Kinda crazy i'll have to drive 7 hours RT, to pick up the vehicle. I guess my expectations were maybe a little too high :) .\n\nIn the end I have decided to keep the Model 3 given the issues are relatively minor, and seem to have been corrected. If issues continue to be persistent, I know there is still recourse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some photos for your viewing pleasure:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iv1w5ju45eg51.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12323f6543dff4a32befc40ede352df41281f0d4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jia3yrt45eg51.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f4f7b0080bffbabb8558226ca10b941740b17a\n\n[Away she goes :\\(](https://preview.redd.it/ryb3c9ow5eg51.jpg?width=827&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82a4c23457d004e30ee982cf9f8ee9b9ef947c2)",

      "title": "Charging Install Tax Credit Extended",
      "text": "Don't forget if you installed a charging setup in 2020, you can get a 30% credit on your 2020 Federal tax return.  This includes anything from a NEMA 14-50 outlet install to a full Wall Connector install for Tesla owners.  If you purchase a second mobile connector for use with a NEMA 14-50 outlet, this will count too.\n\nOriginally the extension of the tax credit went through Dec 31 2020, but now it has been updated to end on Dec 31 2021.  So if you still haven't installed charging yet, you have all of this year to do it and then file on your 2021 federal taxes.    As you can see here, you can still apply for installations as early as 2017.  So if you have put in electrical vehicle charging in 2017 through 2019, you can do so.  However, you need to file an amended tax return to claim your charging credit.  This includes hardware and installation costs. Make sure you keep copies of all your receipts in case you need them for proof.   Remember to contact a tax professional if you have any further questions about this tax credit and how it applies to your situation.  If you use a tax program like Turbotax, make sure to fill this form out. \n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/aKX1BKeXM6U](https://youtu.be/aKX1BKeXM6U) \n\n[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8911.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8911.pdf)\n\n[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8911.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8911.pdf)",

      "title": "2 Years and 110k km review in a cold, Canadian prairies climate",
      "text": "We bought an EV 2 years ago and it seems like everywhere we go, people are really interested in it. I did a 1 year, 53k km review that can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/zruis8/1_year_and_53k_km_with_an_ev_in_saskatchewan/) It goes into the background about why we decided to go the route we did, which EV's we considered, etc. Basically we drive a lot and were spending a ridiculous amount on fuel so wanted to reduce our costs. We have done that.\n\nWe decided to purchase a Tesla Model 3 because it was the cheapest AWD EV we could get and the Tesla fast charging (Level 3) infrastructure is vastly superior to anything else.\n\nWhen charging at home, we use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle. We just bought a couple adaptors for it. We installed a NEMA 14-50 plug in the garage. We did this ourselves for material cost, which was about $75. At the max 32 amps, it charges at 10% an hour. We park in a heated (5C) garage year round, but that is not a requirement.\n\nFor the life of the vehicle, we are averaging 208 Wh/km. Typical home power costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering the climate here. We have added solar to our home, so we try to charge as much as possible when the sun is shining, reducing our cost even more when we can.\n\nMore affordable EV's are constantly being released, but they are still very hard to get in Saskatchewan. The fast charging infrastructure has vastly improved since we got the vehicle. Tesla is officially opening up their fast charging network to Ford and GM in February 2024, which will be a massive step forward for those companies. Most other manufacturers are adopting the Tesla (NACS) charge port in the coming years which will definitely help the viability of those EV's here in SK.\n\nUnfortunately, Tesla has greatly increased the fast charging costs. Throughout SK it is now $0.60/kWh, or 4x as expensive as home charging. There are some other fast chargers that can be cheaper than the Tesla network. Even so, with gas prices declining, if exclusively fast charging on a trip, an EV is not near as cheap to run as they used to be. It is a similar usage cost to a Honda Civic if you are exclusively fast charging.\n\nFast chargers are constantly being built, but we absolutely need a lot more. More Level 2 chargers, which are relatively cheap to install, are needed at destinations like golf courses, rec centers, museums, all the types of places that out of towners frequent. Saskatchewan does have a substantial advantage in that Level 1 chargers already exist at most work places, hotels, etc. Being prepared for a lot of block heaters has its advantages.\n\nObviously the major concern people have with EV's is winter driving. I do not have any concerns any more. If I was constantly doing long distance, remote trips, especially if towing, obviously an EV is not ideal. However, for the normal commuter or long distance driver, there really should not be a worry. I think If your commute is 250km or less, an EV really is ideal. I actually prefer driving our EV in the winter now. It instantly blows warm air, you don't have to wait for an engine to warm up before creating heat. Below about -35C when travelling at highway speeds, it isn't hot. But it easily keeps the interior at 20C and works just as well as a regular vehicle.\n\nThe ability to control the vehicle through an app, for free, is awesome. We set our departure time and the cabin and battery are warm and ready at that time. You can also set your charging times, charging % limit, view charging stats and really do almost anything through the app. It really does work great.\n\nOur first year with the vehicle we have zero issues. The past year, we have had some. All work was done at the service center in Saskatoon. They have been awesome to deal with. The heat pump failed and was replaced under warranty. The front suspension also was creaking and was fully replaced under warranty. Neither of these was a surprise as they were common issues at the time. We also had a charge port replaced as the locking mechanism was sticking. The rear motor oil pump was also replaced. These were all replaced under warranty for free. All items were replaced with updated items that hopefully have fixed the problems. So far we haven't had any further issues.\n\nMaintenance has been minimal. I change the cabin air filters 2 or 3 times a year because we live on gravel. I get the brakes serviced annually. That is all that we have for maintenance.\n\nTo summarize, we are very happy with our EV. While it hasn't been perfect and it takes more planning on trips, it really works great for us. It is crazy cheap to drive, especially when charging at home. That is huge for us because we obviously drive a lot. I think we will always have at least 1 EV as our main commuter vehicle. We have been really happy with it",

      "text": " Our Model 3 a year ago and its hard to find reviews for these cars in areas that get cold. Really cold. -40 cold. So I figured I would write a review. And discuss our costs vs the ICE vehicle we previously owned.\n\nWe picked up a new, 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range on December 31 and have just passed 53000km. So far it has been outstanding, performing incredibly well. We\u0019ve added PPF to the entire front, tinted windows in the rear, Rally Armor flaps, Mountain Pass Performance skid plate and winter wheels with Michelin X-Ice Snow winter tires. We keep the hub caps on the standard wheels in the summer to increase efficiency.\n\nWe live about 35km out of town, going to town at least twice a day during the week for daycare. We also do a 900km round trip quite often. We had 2 front facing car seats when we bought it, but now one kid is in a booster.\n\nOur previous vehicle was a 2010 Lexus RX350 that was paid off. Fuel costs were getting too high so we decided to take the plunge to an electric. We used money we got from the sale of the vehicle as a down payment on the new one. I\u0019m 6ft tall with relatively long legs. I am more comfortable in the Model 3 than I was in the RX350.\n\nOriginally was expecting to buy a Chevrolet Bolt EUV, but with the recalls we couldn\u0019t buy one. We then decided that AWD was a requirement considering where we live and my wife strongly prefers it. Alternatives we considered were the VW ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mach-E. The wait for the Hyundai and VW were likely minimum 2 years and the local Ford dealer is not the best combined with prices that we thought were too high. Ground clearance wasn\u0019t a huge factor as we have a truck that I drive if it snows too much. And the Tesla Supercharging network is infinitely better than anything else in the prairies right now.\n\nThe car is parked in a heated (5C) garage year round. I installed a NEMA 14-50 outlet and charge at a max of 18 amps. We could charge at up to 32 amps, but it doesn't need to be that fast. We just use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle and a 14-50 adaptor. It\u0019s always plugged in and the battery is set to a maximum charge of 80%. In the winter, we schedule our departure time using the app. \n\nOur lifetime average is 207 Wh/km. Power at home costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering, especially considering the climate here.\n\nNow the main reason why we bought the car, to save money. We obviously drive a lot, way more than normal which made the math simple to justify. Our total public charging costs for the year are $1137. Our home power usage increased by about 9700 kWh, or $1455. We also used some free chargers. That gives us a total power cost of $2592. In our previous vehicle we averaged 13L/100km of premium fuel. At a conservative estimate of $1.75/L fuel price for the year, that works out to a total fuel cost of $12,057. (13L\\*$1.75 = $22.75/100km. 53000/100 = 530. 530\\*22.75 = $12,057). Our previous vehicle would have very conservatively required $1000 in maintenance to give us an annual cost of $13,057. Our total maintenance cost for our EV for the year was $150 for a brake service and cabin air filters. In our 1 year with an EV, we have saved at least $10,315 in driving cost. (($12,057 + $1000) - ($2592+$150) = $10,315). Including the price of our car payment, we have still saved over $2700 this year. And it actually is even more than that, if you were to properly factor in paying for gas (100% depreciation) vs paying for the car (much less than 100% depreciation).\n\nThe one concern everyone seems to have is the heat. It been great except when below -35C (-31F) on the highway. Sometimes at that temperature it\u0019s great, but other times it\u0019s just ok. It is always plenty good enough, even at those temperatures. In my experience, it is just as good below -35C as other vehicles I have had (Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra, Lexus RX350, Dodge Ram, to name a few) and better than others, like our previous Honda Civic. The BEST part about the heat, is that it is instant. You don't have to wait for the engine to warm up before it starts throwing heat. You turn it on with the app and in 5 minutes at -35C, the interior is toasty warm. Its incredible.\n\nIn summary, we have saved over $2700 this year by purchasing a new EV. We are extremely happy about the purchase! Because we drive so much, its absolutely made sense to purchase it. I still love driving it and highly recommend it to everyone. When we get solar in the spring, our operating costs will be even less. Excited for that!",

Superchargers are what makes a Tesla the only rational choice for an electric vehicle purchase.\n\nWe began in the Portland Oregon area and headed down to Los Angeles California, visited with family, saw some sights, then headed home.\n\nThe South bound trip was split over 2 days with a stop on the Bay Area. The return leg was a massive one day, 17.5 hour drive.\n\nWe are a family of 4. Two adults and 2 early teens.\n\nFirst off, let me get the only true negative out of the way. The back seats in the M3 are not made for the long haul. The inability to make any adjustment leads to a lack of comfort, which makes people grumpy. This is not a fault of Tesla, rather just the fact that the M3 is a sedan. I do think that the seats generally are not as comfortable as other manufactures, but it could be my body type. I have not spent any appreciable time in a Model Y, but I imagine their ability to recline makes a big difference.\n\nPositives.\n\n* The car is smooth as butter. It is not a fatiguing car to drive.\n* Dual motors and instant torque never gets old and can extricate you from a jam that would otherwise cause stress in most ICE cars.\n* Auto Pilot is very cool and reduces fatigue. Unless you're doing 80mph at night, and it sees a piece of fabric in the road and emergency brakes. Then it's pretty stressful.\n* Room for cargo is not an issue at all. Suitcases, duffles, back packs, other crap. Still had room.\n* Superchargers are great. We all agreed that having to stop every 2 - 2.5 hours was nice. We like that we weren't confined to a gas station, and usually had better options to walk around and get food.\n\nLess positives.\n\n* There feels like too little room for the stuff that piles up on a long trip. Too small cup holders. Charging cables inconvenient for front seats. Door nooks don't hold much. My sunglasses never found a happy home.\n* Superchargers. Sometimes it felt like I was hunting for them. They were on occasion in split locations. Examples are hidden in the back of hotels, or 4 in one obvious location and 12 not obviously around a corner. We only had to wait a few minutes once, but I can see how it would be a problem hitting a bank of 8 chargers that are full and there's a line of folks waiting.\n* The battery icon on the main screen is horribly inaccurate and should be set to % or ignored completely. The energy graph is the place to look.\n* The overall impression of the superchargers is that I'm arriving at a transition in time, like when Blockbuster started getting DVD's but most people had VHS. Five years from now will be a completely different vibe.\n* Again with the superchargers... on one occasion we had to go way out of our way in Los Angeles to get a charge. It was just the location we were in, but it was the one time when it felt like a pain in the rear.\n* Lastly with the superchargers... This is where Tesla wins. I can NOT imagine trying to do that trip without their network. And I can see how opening up the network to non Tesla vehicles may cause significant backups without significant build out of the network.\n\nIn the end, it was really cool to take the car on that long of a trip. I had 1000 free miles from a referral, so the total charging cost was about $65. (I picked up a full charge at the hotel we stayed at on 2 of the days). BUT ... should we take the family on a long road trip again, we're taking our Toyota Highlander ONLY because the back seats are more comfortable. If it's 1 or 2 people or a short trip sub 500 miles...  Tesla all day long.",

      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, Cross County Road Trip](https://preview.redd.it/cc17lf72s4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54de4217b0f8e029626039f40026f1ca01f94483)\n\nAfter completing a [cross-country road trip](https://startupsidekick.com/roadtrip/) in my two-year old Tesla Model 3, I fell in love with it all over again and knew I had to write a post about it.\n\nIn my opinion, Tesla hasn\u0019t just revolutionized the electrical vehicle (EV) industry, it has reinvented the car, as I will show you in this (highly biased) post. \n\nWhether you\u0019re in the market for a Tesla, are an existing owner or are simply curious about EVs, I hope you\u0019ll get some value from this post.\n\nYou\u0019ll see why comparing a Tesla to most cars today is like comparing a smartphone to a flip phone \u0014 it\u0019s really that big of a difference.\n\nIf you don\u0019t know much about how EVs work, I highly recommend watching this popular 10-minute YouTube video titled [How does an Electric Car work?](https://youtu.be/3SAxXUIre28) \u0014 it\u0019s a bit technical but overall worth a one-time watch to understand why EVs are the future. It\u0019s no surprise the [EV market is expected to reach over $800 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/08/2045017/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-Market-to-Reach-802-81-Billion-Globally-by-2027-Allied-Market-Research.html)! \n\nIn this post, we\u0019ll take a tour of the following aspects of a Tesla Model 3:\n\n1. App\n2. Exterior\n3. Interior\n4. Driving\n5. Charging\n6. Safety\n7. Maintenance\n8. Community\n9. Cost\n10. Improvements\n\nHere we go.\n\n# 1. App\n\nBefore describing the car itself, I want to begin with one of the most convenient aspects of owning a Tesla: the [Tesla mobile app](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app). This serves as your primary car key and provides many remote control features.\n\nThe mobile app automatically unlocks and locks the Tesla 3 doors using bluetooth \u0014 this short-distance, keyless access is extremely convenient because it\u0019s hands-free (e.g. phone in pocket) and eliminates having to carry a physical car key.\n\nTesla does provide key FOBs but in the two years of owning my car, I\u0019ve only used them for valet parking or as a backup in my wallet, in case my phone dies. \n\n[Tesla Mobile App](https://preview.redd.it/58dwvga5s4y51.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317f6d10451adbbec6f8ac44fc17f8503bd414ea)\n\nThe Tesla mobile app complements the interior touchscreen by giving you many controls outside the car. \n\nThe long list of remote control features include lock/unlock doors/trunks, turning on the climate, control charging, valet mode, honk/flash to locate the car, set speed limit&and more.\n\nYou can even use the Summon feature to slowly drive the car in reverse or forward \u0014 think remote control toy cars \u0014 this can come in handy for water puddles or tight garages.\n\nOther neat features include the ability to send an address to your car from maps apps such as Apple and Google Maps (via the share option). You can even locate where your car is parked using the app.\n\nThese types of pragmatic, modern day tech features is what sets Tesla apart from all other car manufacturers.\n\n# 2. Exterior \n\nThe Tesla 3 is a sleek looking four door sedan, which drives like an expensive sports car.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 - Exterior, Frunk and Trunk](https://preview.redd.it/8h0tg7bgs4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad56e9c4135dacc45288284f8571e66a35542b68)\n\nThe doors have unique flush handles that are aerodynamically designed to reduce drag. You\u0019ll have to get used to giving one time instructions to first time users, such as \u001cput the thumb on the fat part of the handle and open with the rest of your hand.\u001c\n\nTesla 3 comes with two trunks, a conventional rear trunk and an innovative, front trunk (\u001cfrunk\u001d). \n\nI find the frunk extremely useful for small bags (e.g. groceries), since the incline keeps the bags from sliding around. I used to get strange looks when I opened the frunk but people seem to be getting used to it, thanks to a growing number of Teslas on the road.\n\nThe rear trunk also has lots of room with an additional compartment under the trunk\u0019s floor. You can also fold the rear seats down for longer objects (e.g. skis); I was able to fit a hybrid bicycle in there once.\n\n# 3. Interior\n\nWhen people get inside a Tesla 3 for the first time, they are often taken aback by how bare the interior is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1zpvo0ms4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62a611c636906e381a3503b728a84b3ba2554d8\n\nThen&they slowly begin to get wowed by how many features are packed in the deceptively minimalistic interior.\n\nThe Tesla 3 can comfortably seat five people, with heating in all seats. It has more legroom than conventional, internal combustion engine (gasoline) cars, since there\u0019s no transmission hump in EVs.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Minimalist Interior](https://preview.redd.it/gw6p397ns4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb614abeeedb58905b4a9d34322f45f1778cb575)\n\nWith the rear seats folded down, there\u0019s enough space to fit a twin size airbed \u0014 I have read about people sleeping overnight in their Teslas, at campgrounds.\n\nThe Tesla 3 has your basics: seats, air vents, several cup holders, multiple storage compartments, USB and 12v chargers, door locks, and window controls (auto retract for all four windows). \n\nAt the center of the front panel is a single, gorgeous 15-inch, extremely responsive, touchscreen to operate everything else (including the glovebox) \u0014 essentially your control center.\n\n[Touchscreen](https://preview.redd.it/c6hscs2ss4y51.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc20ae579abe5f6d2bcb67f47198dddc00937dbd)\n\nGetting used to having everything on a single screen takes only minutes to get comfortable with, since most of us use mobile devices these days, so it\u0019s a familiar feel.\n\nI\u0019ve personally fallen in love with the single touchscreen concept, since it feels like using a tablet (e.g. iPad) and gives the car a more airy feel, without the clutter of knobs you find in most cars.\n\nIt\u0019s baffling to me that other car manufacturers haven\u0019t realized the simple fact that consumers love their smartphones, since most cars still have a fragmented instrumentation dashboard.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto support helps but it still doesn\u0019t provide an integrated, smartphone-like, user experience (Ux) \u0014 imagine if you had part knobs and part touchscreen to operate your smartphone! \n\n[Settings](https://preview.redd.it/ghibu2dts4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a94d6a6ceb2bd2ac3716e8ff4adb93b3f7d2631)\n\nThe 15-inch touchscreen provides you access to many features, almost too many to cover in detail in this post, so I\u0019ll list them instead:\n\n* Speedometer\n* Door lock/unlock\n* Settings (glovebox, lights, locks, display, driving, Full Self-Driving (FSD)/Autopilot, navigation, safety, service, software, etc.)\n* Climate control\n* Wiper control\n* Backup camera\n* Navigation: Everything you can expect from a mapping app, with comprehensive supercharger network support built in. The satellite view is amazingly responsive!\n* Battery level, settings and consumption\n* USB connectivity/charging and 12V charging\n* Objects nearby (cars, trucks, motorcycles, signs, people, traffic lights, lane markings)\n* Dashcam \u0013 record video footage on a USB drive using Tesla\u0019s external cameras (see video at the end of this post)\n* Custom driver profiles\n* Manual/automatic garage opener via HomeLink\n* Sentry alarm system\n* Tire pressure\n* Incoming phone calls\n* Seat belt warnings\n\n[Netflix - Full Screen](https://preview.redd.it/eiu8fykus4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43a21c4af2ba34cef64474975bd53fe442135ee0)\n\nThen&there\u0019s a whole section on the screen dedicated to apps, including: \n\n* Web browser\n* Calendar (integrated with your phone with auto navigation) \n* Entertainment (with full-screen support) including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Caraoke (with a \u001cC\u001d), Atari arcade games, drawing tool, fullscreen campfire, and more.\n\nWith so many entertainment options, you will have to find reasons to get bored on supercharger stops. \n\nThe Tesla air vents provide ample control via the touchscreen, with some very cool graphics to change the airflow direction, by \u001cpinching\u001d the air animation.\n\n[Climate Control](https://preview.redd.it/0fyaaubws4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9255b483b56f58f2e92e833d541d71d54481f2ab)\n\nThe steering wheel comes with scrolling wheels that serve multiple purposes, for example controlling the music volume/track, cruise speed, side mirrors, steering column tilt, and soft/hard rebooting the car. It also has a built in sensor to detect whether your hands are on the steering wheel during FSD (see below).\n\n[Steering Wheel Controls](https://preview.redd.it/93vo5v5ys4y51.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a77fd63f0388336f43961e6250ce6d83f01f6099)\n\nOf course, you get all of the above&.under a wondrous, panoramic, tinted glass roof that inspires you to daydream in the daytime and stargaze at night.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Glass Roof](https://preview.redd.it/kiytvua1t4y51.png?width=4160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97c0db691401679f5e24d9552d46aa5e19cd092)\n\n# 4. Driving\n\nThe Model 3 is extremely quiet, fun to drive, nimble on turns, and accelerates fast enough to make people\u0019s heartthrob and say \u001cwow!\u001d \n\nImagine having the acceleration of an expensive sports car with the feel of a golf cart \u0014 that\u0019s what driving a Tesla feels like.\n\nAs of November 2020, here were the 0 to 60 MPH speeds for the three Tesla 3 models (with the ability to go faster via a paid upgrade):\n\n* Standard Range Plus: 5.3s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 140 MPH\n* Long Range AWD (my car): 4.2s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 145 MPH\n* Performance: 3.1s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 162 MPH\n\nTo begin driving a Tesla 3, you turn it on by putting your foot on the brake pedal and turn it off by putting the car in park \u0014 there\u0019s no \u001ccranking\u001d the car on or shifting the gear in park and pressing a STOP button \u0014 it\u0019s essentially like turning your smartphone on and off. \n\nSometimes at a complete stop in my garage or parking spot, I\u0019ll forget to put my car in park before opening the door \u0014 but no worries, the car automatically puts it in park for you.\n\nTesla also automatically engages the emergency brakes, when you park your car. It\u0019s these little conveniences that Tesla has thought of, which make the Tesla so much fun to own.\n\nWhile parking/reversing (e.g. in a tight garage), it helps to see a readout of exact measurement, and audio/visual warnings, for objects close by.\n\n[Tesla Nearby Objects Warning and Backup Camera](https://preview.redd.it/6ozx7sc4t4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8807f4fb65da59769779bcacdceb91b78172691b)\n\nWhen you first use the accelerator pedal on a Tesla 3, it feels like you\u0019re pressing against pure air since it\u0019s so quiet but the highly responsive, induction motor makes it a lot of fun to go from 0 to 60 MPH (4.4s in my car)!\n\nI absolutely love how quiet my Tesla drives. EVs in general are very quiet under 30 MPH, in fact so quiet that many countries will soon require sound emitters in EVs, for pedestrian and bicyclist safety. \n\nThough the Tesla 3 is a sedan, the large battery in the center gives it the weight and low center of gravity, making it more nimble than many sports cars I\u0019ve owned before.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Battery](https://preview.redd.it/mzsrvau7t4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ce892b463b8bbc84419c0bcf6e48828c6ec937)\n\n**Single Pedal Driving**\n\nOne of the coolest features of the Tesla is \u001csingle pedal driving\u001d using a technology called Regenerative Braking (Regen for short; [see Wikipedia for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake)). \n\nWhen you let go of the accelerator, Regen enables your car to slow down rapidly while also charging your battery. My brake usage has reduced by 80% compared to conventional cars.  For example, you can have the car slow down quickly for turns or gradually come to a complete halt at stop signs, without having to use the brakes. \n\nTesla provides an automatic brake HOLD function that enables your car to stay at a complete stop, without you having to keep your foot on the brake (e.g. at a red light). This HOLD feature also automatically engages, when the car slows down to 0 MPH.\n\nThe HOLD function complements regenerative braking, since you can let go of the accelerator while approaching a red light and have the car come to a complete stop, without having to use the brake pedal (i.e. single pedal driving).\n\n**FSD/Autopilot**\n\nIf you\u0019ve seen the 2004 movie \u001cI, Robot\u001d starring Will Smith (as Detective Del Spooner), there\u0019s a scene after he crashes a car, when his lieutenant yells this at him: \u001cWhat is the matter with you? Traffic Ops tells me you\u0019re driving your car **manually**.\u001d\n\nWe are as close to fully autonomous cars, as we've ever been in our lifetime.\n\nThere are [five levels to autonomous vehicles](https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/):\n\n1. Driver Assistance\n2. Partial Automation\n3. Conditional Automation\n4. High Automation\n5. Full Automation\n\nTesla currently has Level 2 in its cars but has already demonstrated Level 3, in this [popular two-minute YouTube video by Tesla](https://youtu.be/tlThdr3O5Qo).\n\nHowever, even just Level 2 FSD is one of the coolest features in the car, since it significantly reduces the driver fatigue. \n\n[FSD - Highway \\(Utah\\), Night \\(Tahoe\\) and Golden Gate Bridge \\(San Francisco\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fy654bhat4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7e6e4692eb4e40f2f5af483f80200bc83a1172)\n\nFSD is a suite of features including Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, and others (e.g. Autopark, Traffic and Stop Sign Control).\n\nFSD literally saves you so much driving that, at times, you feel like you\u0019re babysitting the car, by just leaving one hand on the steering wheel with your feet lounging.\n\nI tell friends driving with FSD feels like playing a video game in a comfortable lounge chair, where you have to pay enough attention to not die but you\u0019re enjoying every minute of it. \n\nI use FSD anywhere and everywhere there are visible lane markings, from 25 MPH street to 80 MPH highway, speed zones.\n\nThis technology keeps getting better with every software update \u0014 I\u0019ve literally seen how it handles so much better over the past year, around things like construction areas.\n\nYou can engage just Autopilot (Traffic-Aware Cruise Control) by pressing the cruise control lever fully down once. To engage the full FSD, you press the lever down twice \u0014 this activates Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, and Auto Lane Change.\n\nLet\u0019s take a closer look at how FSD works.\n\n[According to Tesla\u0019s website](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot), \u001cEight surround cameras provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.\u001d\n\n[FSD - Cameras, Auto Lane Change](https://preview.redd.it/s28sotkgt4y51.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e20f98c616f548049083bedb176d0f050a669145)\n\nThe Auto Lane Change feature is amazing and I absolutely love using it each time! You change lanes by simply giving the turn signal and let your car do the rest; i.e. the car will automatically change lanes, when it\u0019s safe. \n\nWhile doing my cross-country road trip, I came up with two supplemental terms to *Auto Lane Change:*\n\n* *Delayed Auto Lane Change:* When you know you can\u0019t change lanes due to traffic, you can go ahead and \u001cqueue\u001d your lane change request and the Model 3 will change lanes, when safe. \n* *Accelerated Auto Lane Change*: When you don\u0019t want to wait, so you speed up to create a safe distance between the cars, which triggers Tesla to change lanes.\n\nFSD requires you to have your hands on the steering wheel every 20-30 seconds \u0014 I rest my left or right hand on the bottom part of the steering wheel to avoid getting the warnings but I\u0019ve heard of people using their legs, water bottles and other crazy ways to fool Tesla\u0019s FSD into thinking your hands are on the wheel.\n\nI\u0019m a bit embarrassed to be boastful about this but I\u0019ve come to rely so much on FSD that depending on surrounding traffic, I\u0019ll work on my mobile device momentarily (e.g. editing documents, instant messages, quick web browsing). I feel irresponsible and guilty but part of me thinks, this is how we\u0019ll gradually move to FSD&a couple of seconds at a time.\n\nWhile I absolutely LOVE FSD and use it for 80% of my driving (highway, local), I can\u0019t see a door-to-door FSD till 2022 or later, due to factors including Tesla\u0019s technology, roads (e.g. lane marketings) and legislation.\n\nTesla\u0019s FSD technology is already phenomenal and getting better rapidly but it has quirks that still gives me (and my family) a scare every now and then \u0014 enough for me to pay attention to the road.\n\nYou can learn more about Tesla\u0019s FSD technology here: [tesla.com/autopilotAI](https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI).\n\n# 5. Charging\n\nOne of the things people worry about with fully electric cars is running out of charge \u0014 after two years of ownership and a cross-country road trip, I can assure you, this has rarely been a problem for me.\n\nMany of my friends can\u0019t believe I still charge on 120v, after 2 years of owning my car! I realize it\u0019s extremely inefficient but we were considering moving and I just haven\u0019t felt the need for it since I work from home. \n\n120v (Level 1) charges at a pathetic 5 MPH but you can get 50+ miles overnight. 240v (Level 2) chargers charge between 10-50 MPH and direct current faster chargers (Level 3) such as the Tesla\u0019s superchargers, can charge from a couple hundred to 1,000 MPH (using the new [V3 Supercharging](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Supercharger Network and Three Levels of Charging \\(source: pluglesspower.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bctg6tlxg5z51.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42a961e8989be5b20b3540caa7b2902cf85496e)\n\n[According to Tesla\u0019s website](https://www.tesla.com/supercharger), as of November 2020, there were 2,000+ Supercharger stations (20,000+ Supercharger outlets) worldwide, with many more coming soon.\n\nOf course, you can always use 3rd party chargers or use the charging cable and adapter that comes with the Tesla. [According to Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416750/number-of-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-outlets-united-states/), there were over 24,000 charging stations (with over 78,000 outlets) in the US, as of September 2020.\n\n# 6. Safety\n\nTesla cars have the honor of receiving some of the highest safety ratings possible, thanks to their driver/passenger protection (e.g. airbags, rollover, alerts).\n\nFor example, here\u0019s a graphic from Tesla\u0019s website, showing all 5-star ratings for a Tesla Model 3, from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\n[Tesla\u0019s NHTSA Rating and Model 3 Airbags](https://preview.redd.it/krygv2tkt4y51.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f82fc7cab13dc3bdfe994f0b8c42f0652c22a0b)\n\nFrom close by objects in your garage to objects on the highway, Tesla 3 has you covered with alerts. \n\nWhile driving, Tesla constantly detects surrounding objects and displays them on the touchscreen (e.g. car, trucks, motorcycles, people, stop lights, lane markings). Any endangering aspects will show up in red (e.g. lane changes, passing cars).\n\n# 7. Maintenance\n\nEVs in general require much less maintenance than internal combustion automobiles. Tesla maintenance comes mostly in the form of software.\n\nTesla updates the software in the car automatically, every month or so. If you\u0019re new to a Tesla, it takes a little getting used to receiving software updates, similar to your smartphone or computer. Till this day, I find it fascinating that Tesla cars are just as much software (or more), as they are hardware.\n\n[Tesla Software Updates and Mobile Service](https://preview.redd.it/6l7bmwtmt4y51.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6072ac5bcf13cb1bf02df394abf47d1768d4f0da)\n\nTesla is also known to roll out some significant improvements via software updates \u0014 something you would expect to take your car in for (e.g. an acceleration boost from 4.4 to 3.9 seconds).\n\nMuch of any hardware maintenance can be done via Tesla\u0019s mobile service, where someone comes out to wherever you want. For example, I just had my two-year service done for $192.05, in my driveway (see [Tesla\u0019s Car Maintenance page](https://www.tesla.com/support/car-maintenance) for details) with the following note in the electronic invoice:\n\n&gt;*\u001cChecked Brake Fluid Brake Fluid at 80% life. Replaced Pair of Wiper Blades. Replaced Cabin Filter. Maintenance Performed Tire Rotation on Passengers side only, Drivers side tires are good where they are right now. Recommend new pass front tire soon.\u001d*\n\nAll other major services can be handled at one of Tesla\u0019s [Service Centers](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States), by scheduling via the mobile app. \n\nIn my area, they tend to be booked 2 to 4 weeks out but the service otherwise is courteous and efficient, handled using a combination of SMS texts, in person and email communications and generous Uber/Lyft credits to get around.\n\nOne thing I\u0019ve found to be a pain is when you have a flat tire \u0014 the 183 tires used on a Tesla 3 can be expensive and hard to find, since they have acoustic foam inside them. This was the #1 concern on my mind, while traveling on my cross-country road trip.\n\n# 8. Community\n\nUnsurprisingly, Tesla has a huge fan base including online social networks, offline clubs, third party apps, and much more. The following are some popular clubs and third-party apps that I\u0019ve come across and/or use regularly.\n\n**Clubs**\n\n1. Reddit: [r/Teslamotors](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/), [r/TeslaModel3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/), [r/TeslaLounge](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/), [r/TeslaCam](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaCam/)\n2. Forums: [Official Tesla Forums](https://forums.tesla.com/), [Tesla Owners Online](https://teslaownersonline.com/), [Tesla Motors Club](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/forums/model-3.137/), [SpeakEV Tesla Model 3](https://www.speakev.com/forums/tesla-model-3/)\n3. News: [Teslarati.com](https://www.teslarati.com/), [Electrek](https://electrek.co/guides/tesla/), [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/tag/tesla/)\n\n**Apps**\n\nBefore my cross-country road trip, I decided to hook up my Tesla account to three northworthy third-party apps that many online EV/Tesla enthusiasts seemed to be recommending:\n\n1. [Teslafi](https://www.teslafi.com/index.php?search=2020-08-14): Logs data for all your drives with amazing detail (e.g. graphs, battery consumption, maps, charging stops).\n2. [A Better Route Planner (ABRP)](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=99b25e8f-60a4-4cb4-90fa-f42b107793f3): Popular app used for more precise planning based on your EVs model.\n3. [Stats](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stats-for-tesla-model-s-x-3/id1191100729): Provides several bells &amp; whistles for Apple mobile devices (iPhone/iPad/Watch); e.g. schedule climate/charging, open doors/trunks via Siri, monitor battery health, and more.\n\nIt was a bit nerve-wracking to give my username and password to these apps but once you have an authentication key from one of them, you can use that for the others.\n\nAdvanced users with coding skills can use the [unofficial Tesla JSON API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) to obtain an authentication key or use [Teslamate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate), a self-hosted data logger with dashboards for driving, charging, efficiency, drain, stats, and much more.\n\nOnce you\u0019re setup with these apps, the amazing data they provide makes the whole process worthwhile, as you can see from some of the screenshots below.\n\n[Third Party Tesla Apps](https://preview.redd.it/mxntxwzot4y51.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9909b7db37d5f70871ba149df19ba75ccee11c)\n\n**Aftermarket**\n\nThere are plenty of aftermarket products for Tesla available on various websites. I\u0019ve only purchased two aftermarket products: a Qi wireless phone charger and a spare tire kit by Modern Spare.\n\n# 9. Cost\n\nAs of November 2020, here were the list prices for the three versions of a Tesla Model 3, in the US:\n\n1. Standard Range Plus: $37,990 (range 263 miles)\n2. Long Range: $46,990 (353 miles)\n3. Performance: $54,990 (315 miles)\n\nFSD costs an extra $10,000.\n\nIf you\u0019re considering buying any kind of EV, you can calculate the cost per mile by dividing its list price by its maximum range. For example, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range at a list price of $46,990 and range of 353 miles costs $133/mile, as shown in the below infographic from [visualcapitalist.com](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind when comparing prices is that Tesla is years ahead of its competition with its innovative technology and supercharger network \u0014 something that\u0019s hard to put an exact value on.\n\n[Cost of EV Ownership \\(source: visualcapitalist.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/iaofinrrt4y51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0999812bc4d6201d3c4033bda45e68f26314fb7)\n\n# 10. Improvements\n\nI\u0019ve owned some nice cars in my lifetime but never have I owned a car that I loved driving so much every single day, as much as I have my Tesla Model 3.\n\nTesla is as close to perfect as a car gets but it can use some tweaks, so here\u0019s a list of flaws and/or wishes:\n\n1. **Alerts:** The on screen blind spot warnings aren\u0019t good enough; most people have come to expect something built into the side mirrors. \n2. **Wipers:** Tesla\u0019s automatic wipers were horrible but since [Tesla launched its \u0018Deep Rain\u0019 neural network](https://electrek.co/2019/10/14/tesla-deep-rain-neural-net-automatic-wipers/), they have improved over the past year but still remain slightly flaky (e.g. turning on a couple of times when it\u0019s not raining).\n3. **Voice:** Support for voice commands is weak and nowhere as robust as Apple Siri or Google Assistant, which can be frustrating since I often have to turn to my iPhone (e.g. calling a local restaurant).\n4. **Lights:** It would be nice to have shortcuts to turn the head/park lights on/off, instead of going into Settings.\n5. **Map:** Tesla\u0019s map is absolutely amazing but it\u0019s missing waypoints, so you end up having to use something like the ABRP app (discussed above). Also, It would be great to see icons for what\u0019s nearby (e.g. restaurants, service stations), similar to supercharger icons. \n6. **FSD:** Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is overcautious, e.g. it\u0019ll keep 3 to 6 cars worth of distance versus the 1 car, I have it set at. Also, given the choice between tracking using the left and right lanes, FSD chooses to hug the right side, which is extremely annoying on highways (e.g. merging from on-ramps). Approaching stopped traffic at a red light on a major road can be nerve-wracking since the car waits too long to begin gracefully slowing down, thereby requiring harsher/faster braking later. The merging on and off ramp with construction barrels, needs improvement.\n7. **Battery:** The remaining battery life isn\u0019t 100% accurate to rely on entirely, since it doesn\u0019t take into account leakage, winter weather, winds, etc. It can be nerve-wracking when you think you have 20%, just to find it\u0019s dropped to 15% (and dropping).\n8. **Apps:** While it was great to be able to hook up third party apps, it would be nice if Tesla officially sanctioned them via some sort of an online marketplace and support for API keys. It would also be cool to add more 3rd party apps support; e.g. Waze, Amazon Prime, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto). Lastly, it takes too long to load the existing apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube).\n9. **Music:**  The music icon should be indicative of the map feature or the music and maps screens need to be separated. The music portion of the screen allows resizing but blocks the directions, in larger view. The music screen should provide more granular controls for track and display the time for songs (e.g. time left/played). There\u0019s no way to pause/mute the radio on the screen (you have to use the wheel on the steering wheel). Lastly, the Spotify interface is flaky (e.g. long load times, checkmark is confusing).\n10. **Tires:** I realize many cars nowadays do not include spare tires but it would be nice if Tesla provided third party options on your website, similar to how Apple/Google have marketplaces with reviews, for third party products (e.g. Spare Tire Kit by Modern Spare). Of course, Tesla does offer [roadside assistance service](https://www.tesla.com/roadside-assistance).\n11. **Superchargers:** It would be nice to have a tall, physical Tesla sign at supercharging stops, since it can be hard to find charging stations in places like shopping centers. A nice trick is to zoom in the destination using the satellite view of the map.\n12. **Service:** It can take from a couple to a few weeks to get a service appointment. I suspect some of the backlog is due to the [issues earlier models had](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/). I had one major and a couple of minor issues early on (steering wheel replacement, door hinges), which were covered under factory warranty and addressed quickly by Tesla.\n13. **Miscellaneous:** Having to reboot occasionally and/or rare black screen. Inside door opening controls can be confusing for first timers, since they look like window controls. Better/adjustable seat headrest that don't stick out so much. Rear windshield wipers to avoid water build up.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs detailed as this review is, I haven\u0019t covered many features, for example Navigate on Autopilot, Autopark, Lane Assist, chime on green traffic light, automatic high beam, driver profiles, and so much more.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla continuously delivers features, so it\u0019s not feasible to list everything here. For example, the beta version of the completely rewritten FSD [began rolling out in October 2020](https://electrek.co/2020/10/20/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-rollout-elon-musk-slow-cautious/). For more information on software updates and other great resources, visit [tesla.com/support](https://www.tesla.com/support).\n\nIn my opinion, Tesla is years ahead of anything comparable on the market currently, thanks to their technology, customer data, supercharger network, battery life, customer service, and more.\n\nTesla has reinvented the car and thought of so many conveniences (e.g. single pedal driving, auto unlock/lock doors, low maintenance), that it makes it a pleasure to drive and own this car, every single day. Even long distance driving feels more like an enjoyable journey rather than a chore. \n\nIf you\u0019re considering buying a Tesla 3, do it. Imagine driving the car of the future, today!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thanks for reading! :)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*If you still want more...please see the* [*original post*](https://startupsidekick.com/the-definitive-tesla-model-3-review-own-the-future-today/) *for video reviews, more photos and...a* [*work anywhere journey on this road trip*](https://startupsidekick.com/roadtrip/)*.*",

Dont get me wrong, I am married and my wife is wonderful, but when it comes to finance or making a bigger purchase, her replay is usually \"I trust your judgement\" and basically all my friend are like; haha buying EV is stupid decision, so expensive and you have to charge 3 days to move somewhere.

      "title": "FYI on Post Accident Learnings",
      "text": "I have sure learned a lot about Tesla, and more importantly, I've discovered what I didn't know after an accident in a Tesla. \n\nI was recently in an accident in my Model 3. The car wasn't drivable. I jumped onto the Tesla app, navigated to Roadside Assistance, and selected \"Accident\" and \"Non-Drivable\". Tesla promptly texted me with a tow company and an estimate to have the vehicle transported to the nearest (120mi) Tesla Service Station in Tulsa. I thought \"this was awesome\"!\n\nThe tow driver showed up, got the vehicle onto the flatbed tow truck and was off.\n\nThe following morning, I was notified by a user on this forum that there are no collision body shops in Tulsa. This was confirmed Monday morning when I received a call from the Tulsa service manager. He recommended that the only authorized Tesla body shop was in Oklahoma City. He said that I in-fact did nothing wrong, but Tesla should have recognized that the car was in an accident and had the vehicle directly towed to the repair facility. \n\nFinally, the car has been at the repair facility for about 30 hours and I was getting anxious about the battery. I opened the Tesla app, and saw the car was actually plugged in at the repair facility! \n\nThe TL;DR is: \n\n1.) Right now - go to [https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support](https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support) and near the bottom there is a search field for finding local authorized body shops. Find the one you would want to take your vehicle to, write it down, and throw it into the glove box of your car.\n\n2.) Tesla Service Centers are NOT collision repair facilities. Per Tesla, there is only 1 Service Center in North America that can perform collision repairs.\n\n3.) IF your car is in a repair facility, make sure that they are actively charging your battery, or make arrangements to bring your charger and have them plug it in. (The caveat here is if the pyro fuse as triggered, it will reduce the voltage from the primary battery and will not charge the 12v)",

      "text": "2021 Standard Range+\n\nI recently transitioned from owning a 2018 Honda Civic hatchback to acquiring this stunning Tesla last Monday from the pre-owned inventory. With fewer than 25,000 miles on the odometer, it's truly surreal to realize I now possess my dream car, especially considering it used to be just a wallpaper image.\n\nSince embracing a fully electric vehicle (EV) lifestyle, I've observed a few key points. Living in an apartment complex without EV chargers means I rely entirely on superchargers and the ChargePoint network. Fortunately, I'm only 10 minutes away from a supercharger, and my gym provides access to a ChargePoint station. Regrettably, charging at my workplace isn't an option.\n\nWhile charging has become a regular part of my routine, it hasn't been a significant inconvenience. I'm either at the gym or within a short distance of a charging station.\n\nInitially, grappling with range anxiety was a genuine concern. Transitioning from tracking miles to monitoring battery percentage helped alleviate some of that anxiety. I've also learned about phantom draining, the impact of sentry mode on battery life, the role of air conditioning, particularly during high-speed highway driving, and the benefits of regenerative braking. Additionally, I've come to appreciate the widespread availability of superchargers in most cities and popular destinations.\n\nLastly, a piece of advice: Don't worry if your battery level drops a bit after a quick trip. Remember, you bought the car to enjoy it, not to constantly worry about it.\n\nI welcome any suggestions or recommendations for modifications from the members of this community.

      "title": "Data Point: Los Angeles to Grand Tetons/Yellowstone 2018 RWD LR",
      "text": "Hey Y'all.  Over 4th of July took a 9 day long trip from LA to Wyoming. This was my first over 400 mile trip so wanted to share some data points for those interested. Round trip was 2700 miles averaging 239wh/mi traveling from CA &gt; Nevada &gt; AZ &gt; Utah &gt; Idaho &gt; Wyoming and back\n\nPlanning: Checked Ventusky for wind directions for any tail winds or head winds, ABRP and Tesla Supercharger map to see if any major elevation gains and charging gaps (especially in Eastern Idaho and Wyoming). My previous car was a Chevy Bolt so I was pretty familiar with driving long distances on pure electric using EA/Chargepoint etc.\n\nCar: We packed a lot due to car camping for a couple of days and tent camping while in Tetons. 2 people slept seats folded down with 3\" mattress topper (we are both under 5'10'') while moving our bags/container boxes to the driver/passenger seats no issues and v comfy.  \n\nActual Trip: The drive itself I used the Tesla Nav and realized how conservative the Nav was for % battery left even when driving 5-10mph over the speed limit (when it was safe to do so). ABRP was a better projection to the actual driving.\n\nTypical traffic leaving LA on a Friday evening but as soon as we got into the Mojave Desert we did not encounter any traffic until we returned back to LA the next week LOL! Autopilot was huge for those long straight stretches of road in I-15 allowing us to relax our arms/shoulders and eyes.  \n\nCharging: Each stop we went we targeted 15% SOC which we beat with no range anxiety at any point. Southern to Mid Utah along I-15 before Salt Lake City needs to step up their charging speeds as the 72kw stations (often times charging at 50ishkw) takes too long even for a bathroom break considering that speed limits are 80mph. Jackson Hole Wyoming has a charger at the Whole Foods parking lot which was huge as it allowed us to have enough battery while at the Tetons driving around.  \n\nTakeaways: The battery efficiency of the M3LR is insane.  Any long driving of 250wh/mi or under is great to me. Even driving 75-85mph we were still averaging ~239wh/mi (4.15mi/kwh) which is insane to me due to the speed we were driving, all the added weight from our gear and elevation gains. Coming from a Bolt, I'd be lucky to average 260wh/mi on a long drive. \n\nFun note: At the campgrounds and parking lots at Tetons, numerous people were amazed M3 made it on the trip and asked questions about charging and general electric vehicle questions which I was so happy to discuss.  Many people were from Texas and drove trucks and were legit considering an electric car soon but their biggest concerns was charging infrastructure which is a valid criticism.",

      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hunky \\(as named by our three-year-old\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cuoulugyukc81.jpg?width=1195&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3152ad4c199cb6466cca2ed422da8865906e8d36)\n\nLong time reader, first time poster. Last year my wife and I decided that we were going to go electric. A bit of background first:\n\nWe\u0019re in Australia and live in a regional centre in New South Wales. Now, there are probably around five model 3\u0019s in the town in which we live (population \\~ 65,000 as of writing), so it was a pretty big deal to us. To put it bluntly, we feel slightly like guinea pigs.\n\nI have had a lot of questions from my family, friends and work colleagues, most of which are along the lines of \u001cWhat happens when it runs out of charge?\u001d (My answer is usually something along the lines of \u001cWhat happens when you run out of petrol?\u001d). I thought I\u0019d sum up a few bits and pieces here for my fellow regional New South Welshmen in case, like me, you are trawling this subreddit in excitement but have a few concerns. I\u0019ll try and skip over the usual hype around acceleration, storage, panel gaps etc.\n\n1.Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries are brilliant. Although we\u0019re just barely in the first chapter of our EV experience, from what I understand (based on the heinous amount of posts on this subreddit regarding LFP batteries), LFP batteries don\u0019t do so well in the cold.\n\nWhere I live:\n\nMean max temp - 31.9 °C (89.42 °F)\n\nMean min temp - 2.8 °C (37.22 °F)\n\nI mean, it\u0019s only been a short while, and we\u0019re in the midst of a warm-ish summer, but so far so good. I plug it in when I get home from work most days and don\u0019t worry about the 80% max charge issue/idiosyncrasy of the previous batteries. One less thing to worry about.\n\n2. Insurance. We upgraded from a 2018 Holden Colorado (diesel ute/pickup) and we\u0019re saving $20 a month on insurance. We\u0019re with NRMA and have full comprehensive. This puzzled me, so when I was on the phone transferring over the insurance from our ICE vehicle to the EV I asked why. The helpful gentleman on the other end of the phone said something along the lines of Tesla being one of the safest car companies, yadayadayada. I wasn\u0019t going to argue. We\u0019re paying $70AUD a month (at agreed value).\n\n3. Maintenance. A lot has been said about this, so I will keep it relevant to regional Aus. Tesla informed me that if I needed assistance with the vehicle for any reason, they\u0019ll send someone from a metropolitan area (or a licensed someone from a regional area) to come and take a gander. Now, I don\u0019t know what this means in a real world scenario (and hopefully I don\u0019t have to find out), but it sounded legitimate enough. The website states: \u001cRoadside Assistance is available 24/7/365 during the first four years, or 80,000 kilometres for cars covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty (more on this in the next point).\u001d Roadside assist policy - [https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/roadside-assistance-policy-en.pdf](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/roadside-assistance-policy-en.pdf)\n\n4. Warranty. The Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty covers your vehicle for 4 years or 80,000 km, whichever comes first. The Model 3 SR+ (now the rear-wheel drive) also has 8 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of Battery capacity over the warranty period. \u001cTesla\u0019s belief that its electric vehicle is fundamentally more reliable than petrol engine vehicles,\u001d and that it is designed to provide owners \u001cpeace of mind\u001d by combining the guarantee with eight years of roadside assistance, which includes flat tyre support.\n\n5. Rebates. Although we\u0019re under a conservative liberal leadership at the moment, the rebates aren\u0019t HORRIBLE. No stamp duty (as a rebate, $2,250) and an EV rebate ($3,000). For that second bad boi of 3k, applications can be made until 25,000 rebates have been claimed so it\u0019s a limited time deal.\n\n6. Charging. Mainly in the wall at home using the included mobile charger (get about 17km per hour) which does us for most things. Will be getting a Gen3 wall charger from Tesla soon, so that\u0019ll be something. The NRMA chargers scattered around regional NSW ([https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/charging-network](https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/charging-network)) are currently free, but will cost $ if you\u0019re not a NRMA roadside assist member sometime in the future. We\u0019ve been on a few road trips and haven\u0019t run into any issues so far. Also, PlugShare. Just get it already.\n\nWe did the classic ceramic coat and tint just to make life easier with cleaning (touch free carwash, then a quick chamois after). We have a three-year-old so have a car/booster seat in the back and that\u0019s all dandy. Honestly, a great family car. A great family car for regional areas just as much as it would be for metropolitan areas. We\u0019re a one-car family and it\u0019s serving us well. Sure, we get a few stares, but who gives a shit.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or clarify things if needed.",

      "title": "The cost of charging a Tesla",
      "text": "As we all know, charging an electric vehicle is much cheaper than filling a gas vehicle. Especially Gas prices are creeping up again. Oil prices are up 30% since early July. But how much does it cost to charge an EV (I am only analyzing Tesla here)? In fact, it all depends on where you charge. If you choose the right place, you can actually save a lot of money over the course of a year.\n\n**Charging A Tesla At Home**\n\nUnless you have the benefit of free charging \u0014 some early Tesla owners are still eligible for complimentary Supercharger access \u0014 connecting your Tesla to your home charging station is likely the most cost-effective method. In North Dakota, you can charge a Tesla Model 3 RWD from completely empty to a full battery for just $7 at home, although this scenario represents the most economical case. North Dakota boasts the lowest average electricity cost in the country, at less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, and the base Model 3 has a smaller battery than all other Tesla models. In contrast, charging the larger battery of a Model S or Model X with the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. (at $0.34 per kilowatt-hour in Connecticut) would set you back nearly $40.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that comparing the cost of charging an EV with filling up a gasoline tank isn't a straightforward apples-to-apples comparison. To get a meaningful perspective, we must consider how far your budget can take you with each type of vehicle. As demonstrated in the table below, you can operate a Tesla for as little as a few cents per mile. For example, an individual covering the national average of 13,500 miles annually while consistently using their home charging station could incur expenses ranging from $405 to $1,755 for charging.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlp3d1lxwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8223570436f03f1411a2227bc912ee894c300739\n\nThe precise figures you encounter will naturally fluctuate, influenced by factors such as your local electricity rates and your vehicle's actual efficiency in real-world conditions, which can be impacted by variables like weather conditions and your driving habits.\n\nT**he Pricing for Utilizing a Tesla Supercharger**\n\nTesla's extensive network, boasting an impressive 17,000 Superchargers, offers the advantage of convenience, albeit with a price tag. A Supercharger can swiftly charge a Tesla from nearly empty to 80 percent capacity within a mere 15 to 30-minute timeframe. However, it's worth noting that the electricity cost at Superchargers is approximately twice as much as what you'd spend charging your vehicle at home. The pricing spectrum varies, spanning from $0.25 to $0.50 per kilowatt-hour, contingent upon your location.\n\nIf you want to check the price of each charging station, Lectric provides this service for free (an EV all-in-one app), it can help you find the most affordable stations near you. The difference between Lectric and the Tesla platform is that in addition to Supercharger, Lectric also supports price inquiries of other suppliers like EA, Evgo, etc. It also supports price comparison during route planning. You can choose the cheapest or shortest route according to your needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krabdumqwssb1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301d999bfa5a4a543803c6e92e429ce126ec8809\n\nWhile most EV drivers typically utilize these DC fast chargers for long-distance journeys, some Tesla owners rely on Superchargers as their primary charging stations, akin to conventional gas stations. The table provided below presents energy expenses based on prevailing Supercharger rates, with annual energy cost projections calculated under the assumption of covering 13,500 miles annually, relying exclusively on Supercharger charging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk4qdp4vwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c9fe328c1379e3f9b04bb273190deb14cc7ec0\n\nTesla occasionally entices new buyers with complimentary Supercharging, typically offered toward the end of the year or fiscal quarter to stimulate sales. In recent years, these incentives have been restricted to 1,000 miles or a one-year duration. However, there's a noteworthy exception for some Model S and Model X vehicles sold before January 15, 2017, which included a unique perk of free lifetime Supercharging. This benefit seamlessly transfers to each new owner whenever the vehicle changes hands. Consequently, these specific Teslas can be somewhat elusive in the market and often command a premium when they become available for sale. Their added value is typically most pronounced for individuals intending to rely solely on Superchargers, considering the economical nature of home charging.\n\nShould you express interest in a comprehensive comparison between the expenses of Charging a Tesla and Fueling a Gasoline Vehicle, I will provide a detailed update in forthcoming content.",

      "title": "New to Model 3 and Tesla - Love it",
      "text": "Hello all, so my family decided to get a base Model 3 a few weeks ago and we love it.  Thought I'd post overall!\n\nI'd finally convinced my wife we didn't need any new cars for approximately a year as I had a surgery recently I had to pay off (almost a year from now it will be).  So, I'm like let's wait.  Well, her Nissan Rogue had the infamous transmission problem starting to go and instead of wait longer, I was like let's dump it (the CVTs on almost all Nissan's now appear to be a 'when' it fails and not an 'if'.  Nissan/Renault can get bent and should have more lawsuits)\n\nSo, we did the usual let's look at a Toyota.  I still own my Prius C and an older base model workhorse Tacoma.  Well, I guess I'd forgotten how much Toyota prizes their cars.  They had 0 of their electric B4209x49a.  They had a couple used Hybird or plug-in Rav4's.  They wanted $43,000 to start on a USED base model Hybrid Rav4 that was a couple years old and high miles for being under a 2 year old vehicle.  We walked out before they could pull it around to test drive and laughed (literally did this, I don't care to play games anymore).\n\nWent to Ford and tried out the Mustang Mach E.  It's a great car, really, Ford hasn't done half bad.  I DO NOT understand the Mustang name or as a 'brand' now, but whatever.  The car is again totally fine, but absolutely uninspired and frankly boring (which if you're going to call it a Mustang, jeez...). The price is also a bit high.  The only thing I liked is I found a BRIGHT macaroni yellow one and it had a matching roof too (even though we went with Tesla and most Mustangs are glass roofs, this is absolutely not ideal in Phoenix.  A full glass roof is frankly cool, but horrific for 6 months).  I took a look at the F150 Lightning too as they had a grip - the BASE model ones they had they wanted to charge a 10% 'dealer premium' on.  I laughed again as this is asinine and I don't do a bait and switch - a $65,000 truck online suddenly became $72,000 because of a $7,000 dealer premium.  Their rationale was it's a premium truck like a Raptor or whatever an 'in demand'.  I drive by a few times a week, they have the same ones still there, in the same spot.  I guess it's not 'so in demand'.  \n\nWhich lead us to going back to a demo drive at Tesla decided between the Y and 3, and we landed on the 3 due to the awesome pricing and tax credit.  You get the same or more car than the Mach E or ANY Toyota and it's cheaper... before the tax credit.  It's also stupid easy to buy - there's a price, a few options (and these are real options, not bullshit packages like the dealers.  You want 7 seats in the Y, pay for that.  You want a tow hitch, pay for that.  None of this want the moon roof?  Well you also need to buy a premium sound package!)  Order the car on the weekend, picked up Tuesday afternoon and only was a day longer because her trade-in had a snafu on the mileage report we had to clear up with the government.  \n\nWe love the car.  It's fast.  We had my handyman put in a 14-50 plug in the garage (my lord are industrial plugs WAY more and paying for over 70' of 6 gauge romex wire EXPENSIVE).  It charges great.  We've already done a couple day trips that are longer and used superchargers too - it's all so seamless.  Really, Tesla has hit it out of the park.\n\nJust to wrap up - why are the other car makers so horrid still?  They are literally pushing away customers.  Granted, the Tesla was already high up on a list, but Toyota has lost me as a future customer forever.  Also, the Japanese makers seem absolutely petulant about making electric cars - hybirds were great in 2003 but time has marched on.  I can't see myself buying their vehicles as they currently are and Toyota and Honda both have a joke offering of any electrical cars in the near future.  Ford is ahead of most with at least 2 solid models, but they are stuck in the 1960s.  The dealership model has to die and Tesla will make that happen.  \n\nFinal weird thought/question - I know legally car companies have to charge the 'same destination' charge and it has to be a separate line item - but why does Tesla still play this game?  I don't know if legally the MUST charge it - fine, but then make it $1 for each car.  It was slightly annoying to have to add in the extra  $1300 or whatever when doing quick loan estimates.",

      "text": "A friend of mine has a retail business that, partly due to the pandemic, has a very high demand for deliveries.  So he asked me if I would like to help him out doing deliveries for the next few days (including today).  I have a few days off from my regular job, so I figured I could help him out and make a few bucks at the same time.  The other perk, which I realized today, was that I was getting paid to drive my car all day.  So a win-win all around.\n\nBut doing this today, I realized what a great delivery vehicle the Model 3 is (really, most any EV).  The deliveries are all in urban areas, lots of stop and go with very little highway driving.  So my efficiency was pretty good.   Also, I have done this type of driving before in ICE vehicles and never liked it.  Speed up, hit the brakes, stop for a traffic light, accelerate again, stop sign.  Just constantly back and forth between the gas and brake pedal.  With the Model 3 and Hold Mode on, I rarely took my foot off the accelerator.\n\nThen with an ICE vehicle, do you shut off the engine when you get out to make a delivery or keep the motor running?  Not even something you think about in an EV.\n\nAfter each stop, I then had to look at the next deliveries to decide which one to do next, which route to take, etc.  Again, no idling. \n\nThen, it was fairly warm today in the Northeast.  An ICE vehicle would have had a lot of heat coming off it, which would have made it even warmer getting in and out of the car.  I am sure my electric motors heated up somewhat, but nothing that I could feel getting in and out, or sitting with my windows open planning my route.\n\nFinally, I get to drive my car about 5-6 hours, listening to Spotify and podcasts.  I wonder if he needs someone full time?\n\nDefinitely looking forward to the next two days of deliveries.",

      "text": " Hey guys! So my dad was looking to buy an electric car given he already has a gas SUV(Rogue). He was interested in either of the two above and wanted me to do a bit of research before he bought one. Generally, I figured the Bolt was quite a bit cheaper, almost $15k less than a M3. But when I looked at my local Chevy dealerships, they mentioned some ongoing GM strike to justify a $4000 markup on the EUV LT. Now after some discussion, I was able to bring it down to $2k, leaving me at $30k MSRP, and add in registration and other fees, etc., it leaves me at around $33k out of the gate. The M3 on the other hand is at a discount than its usual MSRP, currently at only $37k ($4k less than MSRP) near my local dealership. Inclusive of all other fees and the discounts offered by the referral program would approximately leave me around $38k. Since I live in NJ, both the vehicles are exempt from state tax and also qualify for both the federal $7.5k tax credit as well as the $4k credit from the NJ state.\n\nSubtracting the tax credit from the respective MSRPs leaves me at around $21,500 for the bolt and $26,500 for the M3. One of the bolt's primary appeals was its cheaper price tag but given there is now only a $5k difference between both the cars, I'm in a dilemma over which to suggest to my dad. The M3 is the better car but it was never $15k-20k better than the Bolt EUV. But is it worth going the distance for only $5k more?",

What would I expect as trade in value from Tesla?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Paint:**\n\n* Having worked in the used car and used part worlds for many years, I've seen lots of examples of paints from the different manufacturers not lasting.  Especially the clear coats.  How well is the paint holding up the projected long life of the car?\n* If I chose to wrap the entire car, would this help preserve the paint?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Purchasing:**\n\nI've spoken with my bank and have been pre-approved for the loan to purchase the car.  I was instructed that my next step for them was to come back once I have been provided with the VIN# and the final amount I wish for them to finance.\n\nFrom making the initial deposit online,\n\n* what is the current time line and steps toward purchase?\n* How quickly will I be provided the final cost that includes all taxes and fees?\n* How quickly will I be assigned a VIN?\n* Can someone provide a guesstimate on taxes and fees for a Dallas, TX delivery on a LR M3 where the online configurator says the sale price is $57,500?\n\nMy quoted Loan APR was 3.65%.  How is this stacking up to what you have been seeing across the land?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Design Choices:**\n\nI've been thinking a lot on what I want.  Current leaning after seeing the cars in person is the LR AWD M3 with the alloy wheels, dark interior, and FSD.  But what I'm waffling on is color choice.\n\nOriginally I was thinking the dark grey and eventual chrome delete.  And maybe a semi-translucent wrap.   But after seeing the red version in the showroom, I really think that with the chrome is the best look and I don't have to spend money to alter it (except for the desired added window tinting).\n\n* Thoughts and comments on my choice?\n* What did you consider when you were making your color selection?\n* Relate my choice of the red paint to the endurance of the paint.  I've seen many red used cars where the paint wasn't holding up so well after many years in the wild.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any/all responses and discussion.  It will all help me to make a better purchasing decision.",

Low and slow lol.\n\nI\u0019m currently trying to decide on a new car for my daily driver/commuting vehicle. My daily commute is about 60 miles there and back. I had a Honda accord hybrid that I was paying almost $5-$10 a day in gas with due to my commute and lack of efficiency (it was a 2007 so it did great for what I had) that\u0019s why a fully electric or more modern hybrid is so attractive.\n\nThe dilemma. I have always wanted a Tesla and now seems like a great time to buy with all the incentives and what not. I feel like it\u0019s the ultimate commuter car, but I won\u0019t have the best charging situation at home. Is it worth it to just bite the bullet and figure out charging later? Will I be able to get enough charge plugging in at home right after work?\n\nAny advice is welcome, thanks!",

It's an awesome car and I'm still in love with it after 3 years but my lease will run out soon and I most likely need to hand it back to the dealer. I could buy it out, but the dealer don't want to tell me how much it would cost until 14days before the turn in date. \n\nAs I don't like how bmw is treating me here and also I'm not quite sure if I want to spend 50k on a vehicle that's leased through my company, the most likely outcome will be that I hand it back to the dealer. They also don't offer me to extend the lease as interest rates skyrocketed in Germany sind I got my current contract \n\nAs the German government is pushing hard to establish electric cars, it would make sense to switch to electric from here. To simplify the logic behidn there let's say I would only pay 1/4th of the price In comparison to a combustion powered car. The clue is, the cars listing price must be under 70k euro to qualify for those special conditions. \n\nSo I'm sitting here now and wondering which car under 70k listing price could be a good processor to my m2. Im a motorsport fan and love driving sporty cars, but in all honesty I use my cars only 2 times a month to do a 300km trip to my family. I don't use it daily. \n\nThe only thing that seems to check all the boxes is the new model 3 Performance. I like tech so I think I could easily get along with the Tesla style, but I don't know if my motorsport heart will be happy with it. I'm afraid that I sign a 4 years lease and notice after 3 months that the Tesla is just not bringing me the same joy as my m2. \n\nDo you guys have any advice for alternatives I should have a look at? Would you keep the M2 even if it's immensely more expensive? What would you suggest to a car guy to make him happy for the next year's? \n\nAppreciate your input here! ",

      "text": "I am debating between the Tesla wall connector and a Charge Point for my house. I really lean toward the WC for the ease, lack of adapter and overall experience, but it is not on PSE&amp;G's list because it doesn't share data.  They will cover up to $1500 for the installation of the charger. Since the WC is a little cheaper, I can live with giving up the rebate for the install but I am trying to determine the cost difference per kwh, and either I am an idiot or PSEG's response makes no sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI inquired about this to them and got this response:\n\n***At  this time, Tesla chargers are not eligible for the program. Chargers  need to provide PSE&amp;G with charging data, specifically what times of  day they charge, and how much energy is consumed for each charging  session. The manufacturers (JuiceBox and ChargePoint etc.) collect and  deliver this data (with driver permission), then PSE&amp;G analyzes the  information to better understand the impact of electric vehicle charging  on the electric grid. Because Tesla chargers do not currently deliver  this data, they are ineligible for the program; however, the qualified  devices selected for this program can be used with the Tesla adapter.***  \n ***Currently only ChargePoint and Juicebox chargers qualify for the program  but we are looking to make our approved list of charger brands more  inclusive over the next few months. We\u0019ll keep your application  information on file and will reach out to then see if you would like to  move forward.***  \n \n\n***The program also offers a credit on your energy bill for charging during  off-peak hours. The On-Peak time period is considered as the hours from  7 A.M. to 9 P.M. (EST) Monday through Friday. All other hours are  considered the Off-peak time period.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI replied with the following:\n\n ***Can you tell me what the off peak rate is while using a Tesla charger vs off peak with one of the approved chargers?***  \n \n\n***I want to gauge the impact of using the Tesla vs Chargepoint or Juicebox.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd they came back with:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The credit will follow our current residential tariff known as  Residential Load Management (RLM), which provides variable rates  depending on the time of use. We will apply the RLM rate to your  charging usage for both the on-peak and off-peak charging each month.  Any net credit will be applied to your bill while a net bill increase  will be ignored. The amount of your credit will be dependent on how much  you charge on-peak versus off-peak. The type of charger or vehicle  would not impact the credit rate.***    \n \n\n***Please reference the attachment for a break down of the $/kWh for each  rate. The On-Peak time period is considered as the hours from 7 A.M. to 9  P.M. (EST) Monday through Friday. All other hours are considered the  Off-peak time period.***  \n \n\n***The installation reimbursement is a dollar for dollar credit up to a maximum reimbursement of  $1,500. It will appear as a credit line and you can either use it to  pay your electric bill(s) until it is exhausted or can contact customer  service for a paper check to be sent directly to you. The off-peak  charging credit will show on your bill on a monthly basis, as long as  your EV data is being shared as requested in a timely manner.***  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo first they tell me the type of charger doesn't matter to get the off peak EV credit (How would they know I am charging an EV), and then they say I will get a credit for sharing the data (which the WC does not do)\n\nAll I want to do is quantify the impact of going with the WC over ChargePoint from an energy bill perspective.  Sorry for the long post, but it seems PSE&amp;G is confused as well, since when I called them they didnt know the answer and told me to email them instead.",

      "text": "Hey I was wondering if it's at all possible to guess the long term reliability of the model 3? I'm looking at cars and  leaning towards a toyota hybrid because I feel confident about toyotas reliability. Reliability is by far the main thing im looking for,and it seems an ev would be ideal for that with minimal maintenance. I know plenty of people with old camrys ,4runners etc that have made it 250, 300 even 400k miles,one even at almost 500k. And their hybrids have proven over 20 years to be solid.  So I'm hoping for similar results with whatever I end up getting,any  car build today better last close to 200k at a minimum or its garbage or a lemon. \n\n Im attractes to the y due to the advantages of an ev and base price being  40ish k after tax credit. I was unaware how much the price of telsas have come down since the initial price hikes.   So is there anyway to guess if most y's could hold up for 300k and 30 years or 200k and 20 years or what? All things equal an electric car should be more reliable right? Hardly any moving parts. Would love to do barely any maintenance. I heard the battery needs to be replaced between 200-300k which would obviously be very expensive.  But could it likely  drive for another 200k miles after that replacement? \n\nBasically I want the reliability of a 4runner or land cruiser which are capable of 500k without the 13mpg.",

My delivery estimate is March 16-30 with no VIN currently. How feasible is it to keep pushing my delivery till at least July? Do I eat the $4,000? I\u0019m trading in a car with 93,000 miles and commute 340 miles a week for work. Worried if I wait and hit over 100,000 it will substantially cut into my sell value of the vehicle. My LR ended up around 56k after taxes so I\u0019d be cutting 7% savings if I do it eat it, but at least it\u0019s over 72 months and doesn\u0019t hurt as bad! \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "The basics: 2022 M3LR (Dec 2021 delivery), approx. 8k miles.\n\nLong story short, I *always* charge at home, except for obviously trips and this morning. Woke up and realized I forgot to plug in overnight. So I drove to the closest supercharger (30 min away) and topped up to about 45%, enough for the rest of the day.\n\nThe previous times I had supercharged on a trip to TN and back (I'm in Indiana), I had gotten weird error messages about 1-2 minutes after LEAVING the supercharger, stating \"Electrical system power reduced: Vehicle may shut down unexpectedly\" and one other similar alert. These had no effect on driving and went away very shortly (maybe another 1-2 minutes).\n\nToday, however, I got the messages in the pictures I've attached and almost all auxilliary vehicle functions were inoperable for the remainder of my drive to work.\n\nNotes:\n\n\\- The battery was pre-conditioned as I had the charger set as destination before leaving my hometown.  \n\\- I have NEVER had any alert or error message related to electrical system after charging at home.\"  \n\\- I have ALWAYS had an alert following supercharging.  \n\\- I have ALWAYS pre-conditioned the batter prior to supercharging.  \n\\- Nothing else seems out of place (efficiency, performance, etc) other than the alerts on the systems in the pics during just the drive from this morning's charge to work (approx 20 min drive).  \n\\- Stopped in the middle of that drive and reset the computer with no change or restoration of functionality.  \n\\- After being parked at work for about 20-30 minutes, functionality seems restored with no active alerts.  \n\\- I already have a service appointment, but wondering if anyone has had similar issues and what might be causing me supercharging woes.\n\nThanks for reading and your input. I hope everyone has a wonderful day.\n\n(lastly, please excuse my dirty screen, I'm well aware it's due for a wipedown)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11lrnvctb3w81.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4caf705496eb8739a3c3d9937d4893429d089de\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f911sctb3w81.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b41604f241321a8e40e8223016740e1554ce8bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3amgvctb3w81.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=facceb8e372dd0572ca00df960b2b76a0d2fd364",

      "text": "As the title says, I am receiving my new model 3 RWD by April 14 >\u001e<þ. I live in an apartment complex without a charging port. In our entire building, there is one regular electrical outlet 120V, which I can use if required. However, it will be a little difficult to get a spot since those are not reserved for EV in my complex. \n\nI am a little anxious now if I can make it work with my model 3 without a home charger. \n\nI work from home, and I dont have an office location in my city/state. So, i do not have the option to charge at work. I prefer driving over the weekends, and I believe it should be within 150- 200 miles or less when i get my model 3. \n\n1) Super chargers  are  located 3.4 miles from my place. And they have 30 in total. \n\nThere are some good number of level 2 chargers in close proximity of my place when I look up on the plugshare app. But the parking is not free in most places. And it gets expensive when you charge beyond 3 hrs. \n\n 2) One of the best public charging options for me is one that is located 1 block from my building. Open 24/7, and they offer free parking for EV vehicles. \n\nIt has two level 2 chargers by charge Point. $1/hr for the first three hours and then $0.10/min. Configuration on the app says J-1772 6.5kW. \n\nThey also have one dual standard DCFC station offering 62.5 kW. I'm not sure if this works for model 3. \n\nOne of the Tesla users commented that this level 2 charger is only 24 amps. I believe  it will be much slower to charge even for 3 hours ? At 24 amps, how many miles will be charged per hour ? 22 miles ? \n\n\nWhat do yall think with my current charging options ? \n\nThank you.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much, everyone, in responding to my post and sharing your stories and experiences. I canceled my order and will re-evaluate buying EV when my charging situation has been improved in the future. \f\u000f",

I have had a company owned Ford Escape for the past 6 years but the new position does not offer a company car.\n\nMy decision is coming down to the Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus or the new Toyota RAV4 XSE Hybrid.  The cost of the vehicles is a wash, although the RAV4 would cost another $100 or so a month for gas at current prices.  I expect to be driving 18,000 miles a year if I take this new position, the vast majority of which will be highway miles.  \n\nI really want to go with the Tesla, I already have Tesla solar panels on my house and I highly value the green nature of electric driving, not to mention Autopilot for all those highway miles I would be driving.\n\nThe thing that scares me is the amount of room in the vehicle.  I would prefer the Model Y, but seeing as that won't be available for another couple years the Model 3 is my only Tesla option.  There is a local Tesla store and I did take one for a test ride, however I couldn't put any car seats or strollers or anything else our family hauls around with us.  Right now it's my wife, my two year old daughter, and I.  We are currently trying for another kid so eventually there will be 4 of us.\n\nSo my question is, does the Model 3 work as a family car?",

I found this 2022 model 3 in Kansas City with 8K miles. \n\nThe seller was selling it for 25k and brought the price down to 24500 since I\u0019ll be traveling (roughly 4 hours) to pick up the car. I checked the car over FaceTime with him and it is in pristine condition for what I can tell. I also paid for the vehicle history report (VinCheckUp) and everything looks good. \n\nThis would be a private sell, so we agreed on using KeySavvy and that way I can apply the 4K ev tax credit, making my out of pocket 20500. \n\nThe only downside would be that being a private party you don\u0019t have any type of warranty or anything, it\u0019s the only thing that makes me think about it. \n\nDo you guys think this is a good deal or am I missing something here? \n\nI really appreciate any input.

Many V8's from the 70's and man this car beats them all.  Has the power, handling, looks, and for the price, the technology is unparalleled.  People LOVE this car, particularly the younger generation.

I got it Monday night and then was officially transferred to me by Tesla yesterday. Looks good, runs well, lots to learn but overall a solid vehicle. Only issue I have had out the gate is the plastic covering the left driver's side pillar just decided to pop off. I tried to put it back on but couldn't. I scheduled a service call for Friday since it's still under warranty. I'm coming from a BMW so it will take me awhile to get used to it. I loved my beemer! I still have it as a back up.

      "text": "2022 M3LR One Year Ownership Review  \n\n19000 miles when my wife gets back to work tomorrow morning.\n\nPros-\n\nGreat commute vehicle/practical\n\nTech is great, updates are great\n\nLoving that speed!!!\n\nCons\n\nTesla quirkiness \n\nWife still doesn\u0019t know how to work it\n\nInitial setup for accessories was expensive\n\nMarch 10th, 2022 was the day I picked up my 22 M3LR at Glen Allen (Richmond), VA Tesla Store. Traded in my 14 VW GLI and privately sold my 08 Ram 2500 Mega Cab Cummins for a hefty down payment. The car was perfect, and the process was 30 mins to drive it off the lot. The ride back to my place in Virginia Beach was quick and experienced my first \u001cPhantom Brake\u001d on the highway. I was going down a ramp and the road took a long dip and I guess the Autopilot thought it ran out of road, so it almost locked on the breaks. Kind of worried me a bit and initially didn\u0019t know what to do. After that I had no problems.\n\nHired an electrician to install a lvl. 2 charger set up for the garage. TIP- DON\u0019T SAY ITS FOR An EV!!! THEY WILL PRICE HIKE YOU! I paid 1100 for the setup because I don\u0019t enjoy messing with electricity (not my profession). After a couple of other vehicle accessories (phone mount, trays for storage, and front end PPF) the total came out to 3500 dollars. Initial accessories where steep IMO.\n\nI LOVE THIS CAR! It is a balanced super quick car! It creates driver confidence, and you feel like to you can do anything with this car. The over the air updates the car gets are makes the car better the longer I\u0019ve had it. The phantom breaking, I think is almost not there anymore and the wipers have gotten better with each update. Loving the auto off turn signals addition and the Apple Music is a plus.\n\nThere are a few of what I call \u001cTesla quirkiness\u001d that I have learned to live with. When it rains the driver's side window squeaks. If you move the front seat headrests up the plastic cover in the back falls down. There have been a couple of squeaks and rattles that came and went over the year. \n\nMy wife owns a 22 Lincoln Aviator Black Label and now she has been driving my Tesla for over a month now because she has the longer drive. She is learning the ins and outs of the tech, but she still bitches and complains about a few things. She says she loves to go fast. Waiting for her to get a ticket.\n\nMaintenance has been almost nonexistent. I have spent 70 dollars on two tire rotations and 15 dollars on wiper fluid. 200 deductible on a cracked windshield. According to the Tesla App, it says that I have spent $800 on electric charge (saved $1950). Charge at home all the time.\n\nI love this car and would recommend this to anybody out there!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vy0w2uffsma1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5d597db63635f1a41d255c52dda92d3b197f6f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgyne2uffsma1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce1db1c6c5cd944ccefbaca5dec3ee751f3f385",

      "text": "Have a 2020 SR (not plus).  Since i bought it my only real complaint was the total lack of low end.  Figured it would be simple to install a small electrical component in an electric car.  ICE vehicles have always been straight forward, and aside from fighting to get the power wire through the firewall they are mostly drama free.\n\nStarted reading about the M3 and discovered its by no means just a simple plug and play endeavor.\n\nModel 3s front battery is highly monitored and any arrant activity (such as, you know, an amplifier) on the battery can make the car think the battery is bad and cause it to disable the car.\n\nThe solution to the battery is the Penthouse (DC-DC) connector. Its good for about 200 amps, and its conveniently located under the rear seat:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7sn9kbf1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b407e396576553defa054cf98855d8a1fa9a2d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prjg7ef1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8407077a93f803537064454afa852ae2e7c99e3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isnt the end of the road though.   The car can entirely shut the penthouse down, taking all 12V away from the system.  This is akin to plugging and unplugging the 12v battery on an ICE vehicle.  When you first connect an amp, youll notice a spark.  This is in rush current charging the caps in the amp.   Youll see this once only in ICE, but with the Tesla, it can happen every single time the penthouse shuts down.  If the computer notices this inrush, it can throw the car into protect and youll get all kinds of errors and will be undrivable until you do a hard restart.\n\nThe solution here is to add a 200 amp relay + a 100w 5 ohm resistor.  Power slowly flows through the resistor to charge the caps preventing in rush and then the relay switches to using standard power.  No errors.\n\nNot pictured is 12v switched.   Model 3 has no regular 12v switched so we have to think outside the box.  Im using a solid state relay, Its grabbing 12v constant from the light blue wire in the drivers kick panel for the 12v outlet in the center console, and then its using 12v switched from the center console light.  This wire isnt strong enough to run the remote by itself, thus the relay.  12v turns on when the door opens, 12v turns off when you get out of the drivers seat and close the door (basically  the behavior you want, on when you are in the car, off when you arent)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/momxuvf1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f92cb462b76c09a8e8fe315c4046d520cdecce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ul53ef1qpza1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ca1aac6a8be32e04732408702ec16dd149d64b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lgp9gf1qpza1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d301a256a6c9bfeff919f388f9415743921e2f1e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q650zf1qpza1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23f7bbf85cbfb27f5b8cd3abe18696482b16c5cb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z7tczf1qpza1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0cf6647c7331ddc53539d3ba0b89fd87a98f6eb\n\nHere is a wiring diagram i created to digest it all.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxi26a39z5db1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25b359afd0ecddfd322d38d66b9868f39e81420\n\nThe brown wire in the center console is hidden behind the rear hvac vent, there are two sets of wires back there:  one for the usb ports, and the other for the light sensor for the light inside the center console.  Thats the one you need.  Looks like this image.  I attached to the black wire on the other side of the clip as its thicker gauge and easier to reach.

      "text": "TL:DR - Almost got a NEMA 14-50 outlet, but glad I stayed with a standard 20A outlet instead.\n\nI purchased my Model 3 LR on May 27, 2020 and picked up on June 1, 2020.  What an amazing experience.  The car has been a dream to own and drive.  I got the FSD package, and while I was not in the beta for FSD, I absolutely love it.  Now to get on to the topic of the post.\n\nWhen I purchased the car, I set up an appointment for a NEMA 14-50 outlet to be added to my garage.  It was to be put about 1 foot away from the breaker box, and there were no other upgrades needed.  The electrical company I chose was charging $750 for the install.  I was not too concerned with the price since my local electric company was giving me a $1000 rebate for purchasing an electric vehicle.  Unfortunately (or fortunately in my case), the company could not complete the install until June 20.  So I would be a few weeks charging from a standard outlet (20A) already installed in my garage.\n\nDuring the wait period, I purchased a Y-cable for my dryer outlet (NEMA 10-30) from Amazon for $50.  I thought I may need more charge, since my dryer outlet was just inside my garage door, I could easily run the cable if needed and not have to unplug the dryer each time.\n\nNow, since COVID, like many others, I do not drive as much as I used to.  I live about 5 miles from work and frequently take trips to the beach (20m round trip) and around town.  With COVID, some of this changed, but I still found myself driving a bit more because I loved driving the car.  After the first week, I realized I did not need the NEMA 14-50 outlet because the standard outlet in the garage was keeping up with my consumption.  I cancelled the installation of the outlet saving me the $750.\n\nI only have 7850 miles on the car now, but have been exceptionally satisfied with my 6 miles/hr charge.  When I look back, the charging is good for 98%+ of my daily usage.  I keep the car at 80% charge, and have only used the dryer outlet twice.  Once to boost to 100% overnight (I may not have needed it) for a 1000 mile trip to Indiana, and the other time because I had gone down to &lt;20% after a day trip to Daytona (I live in North Florida) and I didn't want to wait 48+ hours for it to get back to 80%.  \n\nOverall, I have been very happy plugging in to my standard outlet in the garage and even more happy I saved the $750 for the outlet.  To note - I do have a supercharger 2 miles from my house, but only used it once to see what supercharging was like before a trip.  For most of my driving, the standard outlet has been perfect.  When I travel (have made 4 long trips), I use the supercharger network and it is amazing.  So for anyone questioning their charging, I would highly recommend weighing the option to do a standard outlet, or even a dryer outlet, before spending the money for a NEMA 14-50.  In my opinion, if you drive less than 50 miles a day, I don't think the additional cost is worth it.",

      "text": "So talking to a relative about EVs and my Tesla, he went on to tell me that the only reason it\u0019s cheaper right now to run an electric vehicle other than a gas operated one is because of the heavy government subsidies for charging stations. Help me fact check this is this true? So far the price of gas far is more expensive than running my Tesla.  We broke it down to the cost of energy per gallon or per kilowatt I still argue that it\u0019s cheaper to buy per kilowatt then it is per gallon. However the opposing argument was that fossil fuels are still used to make the electricity that goes into our charging stations therefore it doesn\u0019t matter. That once the government stops heavily subsidizing Tesla Supercharger Netwerk that the price of running an electric vehicle will skyrocket\n\nI call BS.  am I wrong ?  Discus",

      "text": "According to a report by Bloomberg on January 24, Tesla\u0019s California factory will become the most productive auto factory in North America in 2021, beating more than 70 other competing factories. Tesla\u0019s Fremont, Calif., plant will produce an average of 8,550 vehicles per week in 2021, ahead of Toyota\u0019s Kentucky plant of 8,427 and BMW\u0019s South Carolina plant of 8,343.\n\nTesla's Fremont, California factory was originally built by General Motors in the 1960s. It was affiliated with General Motors from 1962 to 1982 and Toyota from 1984 to 2009. In 2010, Tesla acquired the plant and carried out a large-scale upgrade. In June 2012, the first Model S made by Tesla rolled off the production line at this plant. Before the Shanghai plant was put into production, the Fremont plant had been Tesla's only complete vehicle plant.\n\nTesla\u0019s Fremont, California factory currently covers an area of \u000b\u000b5.3 million square feet, while the Texas factory that will be mass-produced reaches 7.9 million square feet. The area of \u000b\u000bthe Texas factory exceeds that of the California factory, Shanghai factory, and Berlin factory. The largest known factory in the area. Now Tesla headquarters has moved from California to Texas.\n\n**The current major auto plants in North America:**\n\nToyota Kentucky plant, 9 million square feet, producing 8,427 new vehicles per week.\n\nTesla's Texas plant, 7.9 million square feet, will start production in 2022.\n\nBMW South Carolina plant, 7 million square feet, producing 8,343 new cars per week.\n\nNissan's Tennessee plant, 6 million square feet, produces about 4,900 new vehicles per week.\n\nTesla\u0019s California factory, 5.3 million square feet, produces 8,550 new cars per week.\n\nStlantis Michigan plant, 5 million square feet, produces about 6,000 new vehicles per week.\n\nFord's Missouri plant, 4.7 million square feet, produces about 5,800 new vehicles per week.\n\nThe Hyundai-Kia Indiana plant, 3.4 million square feet, produces about 5,600 new cars per week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough Tesla has an absolute leader in the field of pure electric vehicles, the output ratio of other brands is still far behind. In 2021, Tesla's U.S. factories will only be ranked 10th in productivity.\n\nAfter the Texas factory is put into operation in 2022, there may be an opportunity to push the ranking up, but there is little hope. The real capacity growth will have to wait until 2023 when the Texas factory is fully released.",

      "text": "I updated my 2020 model 3 last night to the newest software. Went to take a drive today around 2pm and got a myriad of electrical issues, car would not drive. One of which was \u001cPlease wait while high power voltage system powers up to drive.\u001d Followed by a lot of technical, car shut down this and that feature due to battery. \n\nOkay I guess understand maybe something happened last night that drew out power from an already older 12v battery in place. It\u0019s a 2020 I bought last month, likely that small battery is end of life. Likely the update may have caused something for it to terminate. I get that.\n\nMobile service earliest is Monday the 20th.. called local service center, they said bring it in and they will look at it (I can do that the car won\u0019t drive). Now I\u0019m stranded the next 3 days I work (Thurs, Fri, Sat) with no hope from them to rectify what happened. \n\nHere\u0019s the kicker. Last nights update had something to do with the windows or maybe it\u0019s a low 12v feature idk. But it\u0019s raining here.. and when I got in to diagnose it, the car automatically rolled the window down all the way once I opened the door. To make things worse it would not roll up after I got in, nor could I get it up in any other fashion. I had to jump it with my wife\u0019s car to enable it to go back up. I got out out of the car with the jumpers still attached, it rolled all the way down again. \n\nMy solution was to have the window all the way down, then hit the roll up window function outside of the car and quickly retract my hand out. Which was fine until I looked at the other windows&\n\nIs this real life? Is this a fluke or something I should expect?",

      "text": "Hey Guys, I recently crossed over the 30k mile mark after 173 days with my 2023 RWD Model 3. I just wanted to post mainly to update on Battery Health as I did another check, which I originally did around 15k miles I believe.\n\nAfter 3 months and 15k miles, I ran a battery health check and it was rated at 93%. The first month of ownership was solely Supercharging, and I thought that my battery might actually be an issue because there is no way that 7% drop in health seemed reasonable.\n\nAs of the 30k miles mark, I ran another battery check, and the health stayed at 93%. I wonder if this has something to do with the LFP battery, maybe the supercharging for 40KW per day for a month straight actually did damage it. All I know is I currently supercharge roughly 100KW per month, where I Level2 Charge at home the other 1000KW.\n\nOverall, its a great commuter car. I envy those who don't see an issue with traveling long distances with this car and don't mind the constant pulling over to charge (because I love driving it). I took the car once from Indy to Detroit, a 280 mile, 4h15m drive. I was asked by Tesla to charge twice on the way, in Fort Wayne and Toledo. The FW charge was 10 min out of my way, however the Toledo charger was directly on my exit. Being preconditioned and charging the minimum to move on, my drive took 5h25m total. And to add to the fact that Supercharging costs almost gas price equivalent, now I'm just wasting time. Also, I had no Lv2 in Detroit, so another stop there before heading back. It's just an inconvenience in Time that I do not want to sacrifice.\n\nPersonally I believe the Electric Car is made for the everyday commuter around the city, short trips. If you aren't charging at home 99% of the time, then you aren't getting anywhere close to the savings you expected to have when purchasing the car. If you purchased the car because you WANTED it, then it was a luxury purchase for yourself, and good for you because they are great vehicles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR. I love the car. Electric cars are made for the everyday commuter. If you aren't charging at home, then your electric car purchase was a luxury purchase for yourself, not a cost savings one.",

During Summer, we\u0019re likely to roadtrip around the country too. \n\nWe can charge easily around, at home and at her parents home. \n\nFrom my perspective, I\u0019m very excited about a few things regarding this upgrade: \n- No more manual gears and true one pedal driving in most situations\n- Limited sounds from the vehicle and better sound insulation, especially on highways. \n- Lowering our carbon footprint by reducing our carbon emissions. Portugal has a lot of renewable energy too, so our electricity is more and more likely to come from those renewable sources. \n- Driving assistance, as our Fiesta has no cruise mode, making long distance trips very tiring. \n\nMy wife is mostly excited about the increased comfort and the bigger trunk, especially to carry the baby stuff.\n\nI\u0019m pretty convinced this is a good upgrade but after reading posts here, I\u0019m starting to doubt a bit.. I evaluated some other cars but none attracted me as much as the Model 3. Plus the leasing is pretty attractive to us financially.\n\nI\u0019d love some honest owners thoughts on this decision!

      "text": "The recent flooding in North Carolina led to the demise of my truck, and I think it\u0019s definitely time to switch to something more fuel efficient. Teslas have been on my radar for quite a while, and I am giving it strong consideration. I live in Western North Carolina, in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and I do a whole lot of driving both for adventures and work. I don\u0019t see as many Teslas here as I do pretty much anywhere else when I travel, and I\u0019m wondering if there\u0019s a good reason for that.\n\nDo any of you have experience with mountain life in a Tesla? In particular, it\u0019s important to me to be able to do (ideally) 250 - 300 miles without charging, so my long adventure days on the Blue Ridge Parkway etc. are still an option. I\u0019m also wondering about how it does on rough, rutty dirt roads, and if the clearance is an issue. I keep thinking I should buy a hybrid SUV, but my heart keeps going back to the Tesla. Not sure I can hold out for the Cybertruck.\n\nI think my funds will probably mean I have to do a used one, but it may depend on how the math works out. I\u0019m going to save a whole lot on gas, so my monthly budget is a lot higher than if I was buying a vehicle that needed fuel. \n\nWhat can you share with me to help me decide? I\u0019d also appreciate advice on where to buy. \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "The M3 RWD keeps dropping in price while the Bolt EUV is hard to find and sells at MSRP or higher. What would you say is the deciding factor to go with one or the other? I already have a deposit (refundable) on the bolt and from what I've seen 2023 M3 RWD are plentiful at the moment since everyone wants a MY or M3LR.\n\nHere's the thing. M3 is getting a significant refresh for 2024. Bolt is being left behind for the ultium battery lineup. I would wait for 2024 when the federal tax credit is POS but in my particular situation there's a $4000 state incentive that's probably running out of funds by the end of this month November. Chevy offers a few other incentives as well noteably a free level 2 charger installation. Tesla has the referral thing.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Bolt, I wouldn't be surprised. I've personally never seen one on the road. The bolt premier has some higher end features even the M3LR lacks, but road tripping with slow DCFC charging speed is dreadful to think about. I'm also leaning towards M3 RWD because, theoretically, an LFP battery lasts 2 to 4 times longer than the older lithium-ion battery tech in the bolt. Of course Chevy's LFP tech Ultium is for next years EVs.\n\nI want to keep an EV as long as possible. My current ICE hatchback is nearing 20 years old and it's seen better days. The bolt would be fine as a main commuter (40 mile round trip/ 5 days a week) but for longevity, the M3 LFP battery may be a safer bet. If I got the M3 I could also without hesitation replace my ICE hatchback for the occasional interstate road trip. Yet the bolt is generally more practical, likely has better build quality, arguably better tech hardware, more passenger space, and slightly less expensive. Any thoughts? And no, I'm not getting both.",

      "text": "A couple weeks ago my Model 3 started having issues with Autosteer and Steering assist.  I would get this message daily.  Called Service and was told that it's usually just that the car didn't fully go to sleep and that i could reset it with a full Power Down through the service menu.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xn6tvj17no31.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95525ed05b2693f58fd1e65f1ebc92be22ca34f2\n\nThis worked, but the message would re-appear. did this for a couple days until i was backing out of a parking spot and the wheel suddenly jarred and rotated about 45 degrees, and  the screen lit up with a bunch of new messages.  \n\nI completely lost power steering at this point...it was like driving a dump truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrsn2b338no31.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62b56d4b0574c4d5da32cd8dd9a8fc98e4ee4208\n\nThe meme was complements a co-worker who was with me when when this happened.   Ironically enough, I'm an Engineering Manager for a fuel system development and manufacturing company for automotive, so i was supporting the competition and our eventual demise as a plastic gas tank supplier when i bought a full electric.   For all of this to happen while we were driving to a meeting to review fuel system testing was poorly timed, but we couldn't help to laugh at it all.  \n\nThe car was really not safe to drive at that point so i got a hold of roadside assistance, they had it towed from Troy MI to The service center in Toledo, OH.  Tesla arranged for a loaner car (when ended up being a gas guzzling Yukon ).  Despite the loaner vehicle, i was fairly satisfied that this service experience was going to go fairly well...until i reached out to the Service center to arrange to get the car sent back to Troy\n\nI have only been able to contact the shop in Toledo via Texting...i have tried going through tesla service and they couldn't even get a hold of a person to speak to at the shop.   So when i asked about having the car towed or transported back to me I was pretty dismayed to be told that i was on my own to get the car which is 120 miles away.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qf6as59bno31.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5753fa551c20b3b2798b8738667114af436c854e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a concern of mine when i was thinking about making the jump to Tesla... I knew that there was a high chance the car could need to be serviced and being that there are no service centers in Michigan.  BOTH of the Tesla representatives i spoke with (Troy, MI Tesla Gallery, and the Cleveland Lyndhurst Dealership where the car was purchased) told me that Service and warranty items are very convenient and handled by roadside assistance.  \"They will get your car towed to the service center, provide you with a loaner until they return your vehicle to you\" \n\nI reached out to the Roadside Group again this afternoon and they did not even know how to handle this.  They could not get ahold of the local shop, and had to rely on sending emails hoping that something will be resolved tomorrow.  \n\nWondering what other's experiences are like in States that don't have Tesla Dealers or Service centers?  \n\nI am thoroughly unimpressed with the experience so far....I hope Tesla get's their act together and makes this right, but from what i'm reading in other posts. their customer service is a joke.",

      "title": "Potential Tesla Model 3 buyer questions: Monthly cost breakdown of Tesla Model 3 vs competitors like Nissan, Kia and Hyundai?",
      "text": "Like many new EV drivers, I'm just starting my research towards potentially purchasing my first EV so please redirect me if there's a better forum for this post. I'm currently debating between the Tesla Model 3 base model (\\~$35k), the Kia Niro/Hyundai Kona *(base electric models, lumped together for similarities)*, or the Nissan Leaf Plus 220 mile version.  I just finished several days of research, including watching the \"Alex on Autos\" YouTube review comparing the Tesla, Kia and Nissan and I'm still torn.  Also, apologies in advance for the lengthy post below...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Two questions:***\n\n* Does anyone have any other recommended comparison sites or reviews? \n* Does anyone know of a site (or Excel/Sheets template) that allows you to adjust the numbers and compare the month by month and annual estimated cost of owning (financing) these vehicles? I made my own Excel sheet but it's only marginally helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Background info on what I'm looking for:***\n\n**CHARGING LOCATIONS:** I live in  Washington DC  and most of the driving will be reverse commuting out of the city to suburbs, with a few longer road trips to Philly and as far as Boston each year. I checked their Supercharger station map and it looks like there are several new stations in the pipeline for this region, which is great. From my understanding Tesla is offering free lifetime charging at Tesla's Supercharger stations for new Model 3 purchases, is that correct? If so, this might push the Tesla to the top of the list, assuming they continue expanding their Supercharger network. It seems like this access to Superchargers would save a some money, versus paying for DC / Level 3 charging at Chargepoint and other brand stations a few times per month. Living in a DC row house with no driveway or off street parking, I can't install a home charger for the Tesla at my address and my office is too cheap to install a EV charger at this time. Also, most of the DC public chargers are in pay-to-park garages, adding to the charging cost.  \n\n\n**PURCHASE** **COST:** On the other hand, the Kia, Hyundai and Nissan would each come in with a lower purchase price (especially with the current $7,500 tax credit). I live in DC and our only \"state\" tax credit is waiving sales tax, which is nice but not a selling point towards any of the 3-4 models listed. As mentioned above, I'm trying to get a real sense of how the monthly cost of each car compares when you factor in financing, interest, auto insurance, estimated electric charging station access, maintenance, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CARRYING OUTDOOR GEAR:** Finally, I'm an avid cyclist and hiker and would need to carry a mountain bike or two on the occasional roadtrip. It looks like the Kia, Hyundai and Nissan would be compatible with installing tow hitch racks, but the jury seems to be out on whether the Tesla Model 3 officially accepts these without damaging the car? Most of the trails are accessible via paved roads, with an occasional gravel road, so offroad SUV-like  groundclearance isn't a strong requirement. Obviously a single bike would likely fit inside most of these cars, but sometimes it's best for the bike to stay outside, especially in winter cycling.",

      "text": "We picked up our SR+ in blue/black last Friday and have been very happy with it.  The technology is amazing.  \n\nWhen we picked up the car we were told that we had to have it inspected within ten days.  This was further driven home by the police officer who stopped me three days later to see how long I had the car and to remind me that I needed to have it inspected within the allowed period.\n\nThis weekend I took the car to a Jiffy Lube for inspection, and they could not do the inspection because I did not have my permanent registration card.  I think that this is not typically a problem because new cars are usually inspected by the dealer, but of course that isn't the case here.\n\nToday is the last of my ten days, so without a registration I am left with no choice but to garage my beautiful new car until the registration arrives.  I am lucky enough to have another vehicle to drive in the meantime ('10 Fusion Hybrid, a great vehicle but getting up there in miles), but I was wondering if this had happened to anyone else and how long it had taken them to get their registration card so that they could get an inspection.  Or is this just peculiar to Jiffy Lube and I should take it somewhere else.  (No complaints about Jiffy Lube, incidentally - they were the only shop willing to take me at all.)",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI currently have a model 3 all wheel drive non-performance configured. While I'm waiting for the edit button to disappear since August, it has not yet. My delivery range is October through December, so I imagine it will disappear sometime near the first or second week of October.\n\nMy current car is a Lexus IS 250 AWD. It has done me very well even with just Michelin Pilot A/S Tires on it. \n\nBut I have debated, is RWD with good snow tires effective? I live in a driveway that does have a slight incline and I have gotten stuck in it before in my previous front wheel drive Pontiac G6. The driveway also enters from a street and often gets plowed heavily at the entrance of the driveway. I live in a condominium and because our fees are low, they don't do it right job of cleaning up the entrance of the driveway. So there are times I get stuck entering with my old Pontiac. I've had not the same issue with my AWD ALexus.\n\nI live in the hills near Worcester Massachusetts. It's like Boston, but usually about twice the amount of snow and even colder than Boston because of the elevation.\n\nBut I have read a lot about Tesla being centered well because the battery is in the center of the vehicle. And while the 4.5 second acceleration sounds exciting, the 5.1 second one that I test drove was equally awesome versus my Lexus, which is clocked around 8.1 seconds.\n\nAnd for the record, I love my Lexus, but I'm excited to upgrade to my first electric vehicle.\n\nIs all wheel drive worth it or is rear wheel drive worth the savings because I can invest in snow tires and get a little bit more range? My daily commute is around 90 miles round trip. the regular roads are not bad and the highways are usually pretty good in the snow, but the secondary roads can be a bit behind and driveways can be a challenge. But do good snow tires on RWD negate this?\n\nJeff",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I wanted to share my experience with my 2021 SR+ m3 after owning it for close to 2 years. There are few things I want to mention for those who have less than 23,000 miles. I\u0019ve had some electrical problems that came up and I\u0019m guessing soon or later you might have it as well. \n\nThe first electrical problem I had was the power trunk. Though I barely use my trunk, it ended up malfunctioning after few uses. I called the mobile technician and he said that the electrical strut and sensor broke due to \u001cnatural causes\u001d. When I try to open my trunk, it would open about 1/4 of the way and I would have to manually open it all the way. And when I try to close it, it would slam down. It would slam to the point where it would rip off my finger. Good thing it was covered under warranty and it took the mobile technician 30 mins to fix the problem.\n\nSecond problem was the left pillar where you put your key card to open the door. Mine used to work perfectly until few months back it completely stopped working. So that means I literally only had my phone to open the door. But what if I lost my phone? I\u0019d be fu**ed. The doors also wouldn\u0019t open unless my app was \u001clive\u001d and had to take out my phone from my pocket and tap my phone to get in the car. So long story short, I took it to service and there were two things wrong due to \u001cnatural causes\u001d. 1. There was a malfunction on downloading the latest boom box software. 2. Left side \u001cB pillar\u001d needed to be replaced due to water seeping in the wires and rusting. \n\nAgain, it was covered under warranty, but the car is still new. If anyone is having these problems, this is the way to address it. I only share this because I want other m3 owners to be aware of wear and tear of their vehicles. \n\nAside from that, I have close to 40 modifications done to my car and I love my m3. It\u0019s kind of my hobby due to my love for cars. Let me know if you have any questions about mods and I could tell you to the best of my knowledge!!! #tesla4life =O<û=O<û=¯=%",

A moment I\u0019ve been waiting for, for over a decade is finally coming true and I can\u0019t contain my excitement so I must share here with fellow Tesla owners. \n\nAfter owning 8 different ICE vehicles over my adult life, it\u0019s finally time to go full EV and with a solar system home garage charging solution to boot! \n\nI\u0019ve been passionate about EVs since 2003 when I had the experience of building very light weight single person all electric vehicles in high school. My classmates and I would fabricate an entire EV from scratch through out the school year and near the end of the year, get to race them against other schools statewide. I learned so much in that program and attribute a large part of that experience as the seed that inspired my passion for renewable transportation. But it took Tesla to finally make EVs cool!\n\n\nThis will also mark the first time I\u0019m purchasing a car brand new. Every previous car I\u0019ve owned has been purchased via private sale and a couple through used car dealerships which is a horrid experience. So far buying through the app has been so pleasant I legitimately still don\u0019t believe it\u0019s actually happening. Someone pinch me!  \n\nMuch love! d\u000f ¡\u000fd\u000f",

It's a, um. A product defect, I guess you could say?  \n\n\nThere are 9 cases overall (US+Korea, excluding China) where this has happened, 8 in the US and 1 in Korea... Yes, that's right. Korea is me.  \n\n\nI didn't want to be the only one.  \n\n\nOnce the engineer checked with the US HQ , he said that in such cases, the connector that communicates with CAN is disconnected and shipped as a temporary measure.  \n\n\nAfter disconnecting the connector, no error codes occurred and the car went to sleep.  \n\n\nNow, what happens if the connector is not connected? Some functions are limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Openning**  \n**Monitor -** can be opened with the open button  \n**Trunk switch** \\- can be opened with the trunk switch  \n**Keyfob -** can be opened by double pressing the trunk section  \n**App -** can be opened with the trunk open button\n\n**Closing**  \n**Monitor -** Close button is disabled and unavailable  \n**Trunk switch** \\- can be closed with trunk switch  \n**Keyfob -** No... just no  \n**App -** No... Just No\n\n   \nYes, that's right, the electric trunk function works for now, but all the parts that operate the closing function through the vehicle PC are not working.  \n(The key pop and app all receive signals from the car's PC, so they shouldn't work)\n\n  \n US HQ is aware of this error and is working on improvements accordingly.    \n\n\nIn conclusion, my retrofit electric trunk has become a half-assed product... Honestly, I'm very upset. \n\n  \nSince it's a defective product, I thought about reinstalling it with another product or asking for a refund... For now, I don't have time, I have to use my car, and even if I reinstall it with another product, there is no guarantee that there will be no error... So for now, it came out.\n\n  \nAnd I already knew about the case in the US HQ... In the article from HQ, it seems that they are investigating and want to improve it even if it takes time... It's a problem that will be solved when the noise-catching improvement comes out...\n\n  \nIn Korea, you can preemptively take such and such measures... Since the US is the HQ and there are warranty conditions...  \nIn this regard, it was very unfortunate that the Korean center cannot make arbitrary modifications/temporary measures and can only take measures according to the HQ's guide .

Originally I was looking at Hybrid vehicles like the Sonata 23, Elantra, Camry, Prius, etc.\n\nMy price range is about $30K. The hybrids I was looking at were basically starting out at that price, with no government incentives (Illinois apparently dont consider hybrids or plug-in's).\n\nThen my boss told me about the price drop of the Tesla's. \n\nHe is a pretty enthusiastic Tesla owner of a Model Y (he was pissed about the price drop, having bought his a year earlier). I started doing some thinking and looking at the price. $39-40K right now and with the government incentive of -$3750 since I missed out on the full $7500 government incentive March deadline.\n\nIt is a little out of my range but.....\n\nMy questions are:\n\nAfter months or years with your Tesla Model 3, how is it? Has the whole no maintenance / oil change thing been that big of an improvement? \n\nWith the price drop, I'm sure even with the lower amount of incentive, not having to pay for gas moving forwards would balance out the additional upfront cost of the car itself. Is it worth it in your eyes?\n\nWould any of you regret your decision? Do any of you wish you'd have gone the hybrid or plugin hybrid route? What are your thoughts?\n\nI dont care about the whole political crap with Elon. I just want something fuel efficient and pleasant to drive.",

      "title": "First Year Ownership Experience and Review From The Perspective of a BMW Enthusiast",
      "text": "I have had my Model 3 for 1 year 10 months and 11 days. This post is long overdue. \n\nThough I am a relatively young driver at 26, the Model 3 is the most satisfying car I\u0019ve owned and one of my all-time favorites to have ever driven. That is not to say that the experience has been 100% positive. Moving from my 2015 3 Series to the Model 3 had little to no learning curve, but the refinement the Bimmer offered is noticeably absent. The following comparison best represents my experience coming to terms with the Model 3's features, personalities and quirks. \n\n**Exterior Styling**\n\nAggressive lines and large grills&where would we be without them? In a time where car designs are edgier than an angsty teenager, the clean flowing lines of Tesla\u0019s vehicles are a welcome sight. That\u0019s not to say I\u0019ve always felt this way. When the Model S got its facelift, I protested. When the Model 3 was unveiled, I swore it off due to its duck-lips-like front facia. The Model 3 just didn\u0019t look like a conventional car. Then again, isn\u0019t that the paradigm Tesla is working to uproot? The BMW now blends right into the crowd. From behind I\u0019d almost mistake the 2020 redesign for a Lexus. Almost.\n\n**Interior Design &amp; Finish**\n\nAs for the interior...well...it\u0019s somewhat of a tossup. Each get equal points for styling either for Tesla\u0019s take on the \u001cApple approach\u001d of elegant simplicity or the BMW\u0019s sense of familiarity and class. Yes, there\u0019s a lot of buttons and walnut but it\u0019s such an accommodating and inviting cabin. On Tesla\u0019s approach, I find the openness and natural light lends to a more relaxing environment. I love them both. \n\nNow let\u0019s talk about materials. Tesla\u0019s vegan \u001cleather\u001d disappoints only in the mind. I find the material much more satisfying to touch and feel when compared against the Napa leather seats I had in the Bimmer. They\u0019re also much more comfortable to sit in but they SORELY lack support when cornering. The rest of the cabin is also much more pleasant to touch in the Tesla where the BMW had some cold hard plastics in places it shouldn\u0019t have. \n\nHowever, premium materials and build-quality aren\u0019t mutually exclusive. Tap the various panels and compartments in the BMW and you\u0019ll find them satisfyingly solid where the Tesla is hollow. Sometimes too hollow. The upper interior panels of the doors in my 3 for example have far too much flex as does the headliner above the driver\u0019s seat. Don\u0019t get me started on the piano black center console. \n\n**Driving Dynamics**\n\nWhere the BMW is definitely the driver\u0019s car centered around the experience and connection with the road, the Tesla skips or misses the same level of engagement and response. That\u0019s not to say the driving dynamics are any less satisfying, but the experience\u0014exhilarating or otherwise does itself at times feel simulated. \n\nBMW: Sir, the outside wheel is slipping. We\u0019re about to go sideways. Shall we proceed?\n\nTesla: I\u0019ve corrected your mistake and allowed the rear to kick-out within manageable parameters. Wasn\u0019t that fun.\n\nIn the end, despite their fundamentally different behavior, I find them equally ready to be both the daily driver and the weekend warrior. \n\n**Technology**\n\nCars have become increasingly connected and complex machines. Tesla has a history of designing their automobiles from the ground up to be so much more. However, I find the more intriguing question to be whether or not it\u0019s as affective as it is disruptive. Is car culture ready for Autonomous Driving and the Tesla touch?\n\nWhile the Bimmer shamelessly outclasses the Tesla in equipment options, the Tesla holds a clear edge with its potential. Yes, there\u0019s no gauge cluster. There\u0019s \\*almost\\* no buttons and no tactile response. You WILL get over it. Touchscreens were a foreign concept when the iPhone first came out. Now, they\u0019re second nature.\n\nThis is not to say that Tesla\u0019s execution and adoption of Technology are perfectly implemented. Basic creature comforts are missing with no clear indication of why. There\u0019s no CarPlay. No routing options to avoid highways. No ventilated cooled seats. No HUD. No powered trunks. \n\n**Cost of Ownership**\n\nOne of the first things on anyone\u0019s mind when my Tesla comes up in conversation is its environmental and economic benefits. I\u0019ll admit that neither of these factors had much of an influence on my purchase, but I did make an effort to track these costs. As I have a daily commute of about 13 miles, I am able to easily top off with a 120v charger connected to a Currant smart outlet that monitors usage in real-time and provides a monthly report. \n\n2019 Tesla Model 3 AWD \n\nFuel: $545.04 (3,893.17 KWh @ $0.14c/KWh)\n\n Maintenance: $137.49 \n\n Repairs: $2,916.80 \n\n Insurance: $2,022.72/yr\n\n **Total: $5,622.05**\n\n2015 BMW 328i \n\n Fuel: $1,575 \u0013 estimated (20 MPG @ 3.50/gal for Premium)\n\n Maintenance: $283.99\n\n Repairs: $1,009.94\n\n Insurance: $1,887.60/yr\n\n **Total: $4,756.53**\n\n**Service Experience**\n\nTesla\u0019s service experience leaves A LOT to be desired. Facilities are few and far between with exceedingly long wait times. Service centers can\u0019t be reached by phone and the only way to communicate with a service advisor is via text.  I have had to wait an average of 6 weeks for body work and 1-2 weeks for general service and maintenance requests. Avoid damaging your car at all costs. \n\nMy experience with BMW\u0019s service centers was exceptional. My service advisor went above and beyond to be available and accommodate requests on my schedule. Repairs were carried out quickly, but did have one return visit for an issue that could have been easily avoidable. \n\n**Summary**\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Tesla\u0019s Model 3 and hope that those on the fence at least keep an open mind when shopping for their next vehicle. You'll experience some growing pains, but the convenience of fitting an Electric vehicle into your life might just surprise you.",

      "text": "Hi all. Just for my main concern, to get the $1500 rebate, it is my understanding I would need to go Level 2 AND it be ChargePoint or Juicebox, so the Tesla WC would be out of the question as it's not approved for the rebate by PSE&amp;G. Also NJ is offering the $250 off chargers right now (not a concern if I go with the Tesla WC). My main concern is this, is it worth it to switch over to the RLM rate plan vs my RS rate plan? I will only be charging off peak and was concerned since a family member works from home, the RLM rate plan would mean we are charged for EVERYTHING we use during on or off peak, not just my EV? Does that make sense?\n\nEssentially, if I switch rate plans, would I potentially see a higher bill due to high usages of items other than the EV Charging? Or does the RLM only apply to the EV rates I'm looking to get? To me, it may not be worth switching if thats my understanding since electricity is being used constantly during on peak hours, including A/C or Heat. These are all genuine concerns of mine moving forward as I'm trying to understand what is what and what to do.\n\nDo I just saw screw it and go with my regular RS rate plan with a Tesla Gen 3 connector orrr am I thinking incorrectly on how the usage gets calculated. I want the EV incentive but not if they're going to nickel and dime me for every kwh that's used by other appliances if I switch rate plans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also if anyone can recommend a solid electrician ( I'm price conscious but solid work is solid work of course so I'm good with any solid option regardless of price), you're a real one.\n\nEdit #2: Got an answer. It does NOT change your entire rate plan. It is only for your EV charging at off peak hours and you\u0019ll retain the incentive. You do not have to switch rate plans to get the reduced EV charging :). Hope this helps anyone that comes across it! Teslas also qualify for the incentive. You don\u0019t just need to go with the EV charger they\u0019re requesting (charge point or juicebox). The vehicle itself also can get you the incentive.",

      "text": "After a month of evaluating EV options and painful soul searching I decided to go with a used 2022 M3P as my first foray into electric commuting. My top contenders were the usual suspects (Model 3, Mach-e, ev6, etc). I found different positives about virtually all of them, but in this insane market for used EVs I couldn't get over the fact that a 2022 Model 3 has significantly more years of production improvements under its belt as an electric model. Basically all the other options used would mean getting a year 1 or year 2 vehicle and that made me kinda nervous on the used front.\n\nAnyway, since the best deal I found was actually from Tesla's website I'm curious if there's a solid list anywhere of what to check for on delivery day. It appears to be a different experience than the traditional dealership drive off. Any suggestions of what to check for or think about?",

      "title": "Model 3 NJ Lease questions/lease owner opinions",
      "text": "Good Morning!\n\nSo I am looking at these lease deal and they seem pretty good! I have some equity in my current car was thinking of just selling it and using the equity to get the charger installed, and paying the acquisition fee + first month. I have a couple questions/opinions though as the website is not super helpful lol.\n\n1. When creating the deal, do you put 0$ in the down payment if you just plan to use the $4000 tax rebate as the down payment? I say this because obviously the monthly payment changes significantly. If I put 4k in the down payment, is that estimate what I can expect to pay if I just use the rebate? \n\n2. Leasing& is it worth it? I am reading something here that says I forgo the right to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease. This is worrisome to me. I have leased a number of times in the past and I typically go over the miles but rarely care because if I re-lease they tend to just wipe away the overages or the car has equity and I just sell it, or if I\u0019m not getting a good deal anywhere I just finance it until I can sell it vs returning it. With Tesla, are none of these options??? I just don\u0019t want to get hit with wear and tear fees, mileage fees, on top of needing a new car at the end of the lease. \n\n3. All the \u001cextra\u001d fees.. everyone talks about not paying for gas or oil changes.. but more I look into it, there are a ton of other fees. It\u0019ll be about $1000.00+ for the charger to be installed in my house (doesn\u0019t look like my electric company gives and rebates for Tesla branded chargers), Looks like insurance rates jump up for EVs as well, there\u0019s a monthly fee for their online access, plus you still (while cheaper) have to pay for electricity and things like tires and brakes, and expensive mechanical work when it is needed (which hopefully none of that is needed on a 3 year lease). Just feels like any extra \u001csavings\u001d are just eaten up elsewhere. \n\n4. Experience with RWD tesla in 4 weather climates. We had a mild winter this year in jersey, and we do have a AWD suv that my wife uses, so trips and bad weather we just use that, but between range loss and snow/cold rain, do you feel confident on the road with the rwd? Snow tires are an obvious solution but that\u0019s goes up to number 3 another $1000+ just to make the car work.. and in NJ, the winter is not always winter weather. I\u0019ve had small rwd cars in the past (had an FRS when first released) and it was \u001cfine\u001d, but def had troubles in poor weather. Also, I have a garage but not for the car to go into, I hear this car is not great with cold weather, do things like door knobs or range really ruin the experience? \n\n5. Is the 250-260 mile range genuinely enough? On Monday-Friday my general commute is 45-50 miles a day. That\u0019s home to gym to home to work to pick son up to home. But for instance to see my parents, it\u0019s 175-200 miles round trip with no extra stops. Obviously this all sounds like it falls within range.. so range anxiety is maybe misplaced. I\u0019m not too worried about longer trips as we can use my wife\u0019s suv. \n\nI know this is long, just thought I\u0019d get some feedback/opinions.\n\nThanks!!",

Neither the Inside Delivery Advisor nor the Sales Adviser I dealt with have provided any assistance on resolving this matter. Documentation has been provided that clearly shows we are owed a refund. However, neither representative appear to be knowledgeable - or perhaps they don't care. The inability to speak with a knowledgeable Tesla representative is extremely frustrating. Nearly all communication has to transpire via email with very indecisive replies.\n\nThere is a distinct dichotomy between the car itself and the support received on the backend of a purchase. On one hand, the M3 is a beautiful all-electric vehicle loaded with a tremendous amount of technology. It is by far the best auto that I have ever driven. However, on the other hand the customer support has been extremely disappointing. The top Google search results of \"Tesla complaints\" revolve around the inability to speak to anyone directly on the phone and the don't care attitude that is pervasive within the organization. I truly hope we did not just spend over $65,000 on a car that I will regret down the road.\n\nIt\u0019s not that I desperately need reimbursement of the $4,412.50 we are owed this very moment. However, it is extremely frustrating there is no acceptance on Tesla\u0019s part that we are indeed due the overpayment amount. Given our experience on dealing with this side of the purchase gives us great hesitation on recommending a friend or family member to consider purchasing a Tesla vehicle.\n\nI read in another post that I should go to my Tesla account and submit a support ticket that should be escalated to the executive level. However, I have yet to receive a response. Has anyone else experienced such an issue that can provide advise on how I get this resolved? Any advise is much appreciated!",

      "text": "I drive around 160 miles roundtrip 3-4 days a week to work and I'm looking to buy an EV that can handle that commute but within the best price range. Im thinking of getting a Chevrolet Bolt EV or EUV because they are the cheapest option and have around 250 miles they can go on one charge, but curious how long they will last for?\n\n I want something for the long term and will last. I'm not sure if anyone has experienced a Chevy Bolt lasting 200,000 plus miles because that's kinda what I'm trying to go for without needing to replace the battery. If the Bolt can maybe do that it would be awesome.\n\nI'm also looking at maybe something that can fast charge quick if emergencies happen. I like the Chevy Bolt because I can easily charge it from home on a level 2 charge and it should be good the next day but one thing i don't like is the fast charge is not as fast compared to other EVs out there. \n\nIm also looking for an EV that won't be expensive on my electricity bill at home since I'm going EV to save money both now and in the long run.\n\nAlso looking for an EV that will qualify for the recent 7500$ tax refund for vehicles made in the US. I saw the list and for what I'm looking for and what I need for my commute not many cars fit.\n\nThe only ones I saw were the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV and the Tesla model 3. I like the model 3 but I dont know if I really want to pay 40K+ for a car and I heard insurance is high for a Tesla. At the same time I've heard Tesla is great for long commuters and batteries last hundreds of thousands of miles.\n\nJust need help and want some opinions",

I barely know anything about cars so I'm not even sure if my questions make sense lol\n\nA friend told me that teslas can easily last 200,000+ miles if you just change the battery as needed. I know gas vehicles have a ton more moving parts than an electric vehicle. I always thought around 100-150k miles on a gas car is when people might start shopping around for something new, but I was wondering if this applies to teslas as well? How much is it to maintain them and when do people typically purchase a new one? How does the resale/trade in value of a tesla compare to gas or hybrid vehicles? Do you guys generally have a positive experience with getting repairs through tesla shops? \n\nfor context - my car (2017 honda civic) is totaled. The accident was terrifying and I was pretty badly injured so I'm also really comparing safety features on different EVs.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Long story short Tesla told me it was the 16 volt battery and they won\u0019t have it in stock for 2 weeks so I need to fly back home. Is this a common issue or will I have to worry about the battery going out every 2 years?\n\nThey told me they can\u0019t ship it back to without it coming out of my pocket. also said I would need to fly back to pick it up but I\u0019m definitely going to fight back on that.\n\nUpdate #1 08-07-23\n\nI got an email saying they ordered a HV battery and will be arriving in 2-3 weeks. I asked for clarification but I\u0019m assuming that\u0019s the high voltage battery and this is worst case scenario. Luckily we are still well into our warranty, (only had the car for about 18 months) Will update when i confirm / will let everyone know what they reimburse. \n\nA lot of people have been asking why I didn\u0019t stay or try to fix it myself. I was on a quick 2 day vacation to the beach, the service center was closed over the weekend and we had to get back home for work so we took a flight out. We also get married in one month so everything is just on a tight time crunch. They claimed they will reimburse for all the expenses but I will be sure to update where I\u0019m at after the car is repaired. From what it seems like they will process everything after the car is repaired.\n\nUpdate #2  08/08/23 \n\nI called Tesla and they confirmed they ordered a high voltage battery and will be down for about 3 weeks. The LV original diagnostic was a virtual one when they didn\u0019t have the vehicle in the SC yet. When the car arrived they confirmed it was the HV battery. \n\nWorking with my local SC back home for a loaner, my insurance told me they won\u0019t cover a rental unless I was involved in a accident. Will update what my local SC says when they open up today.\n\nUpdate #3 08/08/23\n\nThis will likely be the last update until my car is fixed. My local SC told me they don\u0019t have any loaners available. They also mentioned their hands are tied since my vehicle isn\u0019t even at their SC. Apparently it\u0019s a new policy they can\u0019t allow cars to cross state lines / loan a car out to someone who\u0019s car isn\u0019t at that service center. At this point I\u0019m done, no point in raising my blood pressure any higher over this. I\u0019ll update everyone as soon as they say the car is ready / if they will hold their word on reimbursing me for all of my flights and Ubers. Car should be ready around August 28th.\n\nUpdate #4 12/25/23\n\nI\u0019ve had the car back since August 28th and it has been working normal since then. I\u0019ve charged it to 100 percent one time and the range actually read longer than the original range on the older battery. The SC ended up sending me a check for both of the flights to leave / come back to pick the car up. Will be sure to update if I have any issues.",

      "title": "Thoughts on my new Model 3 from a Porsche enthusiast/owner",
      "text": "I began shopping recently to replace an older Cayenne which was my daily driver for quite a while, a fantastic vehicle that was surprisingly not that bad on gas for being a 400hp V8 (about 22mpg average). I still own a current gen Cayenne with all the handling upgrades (PDCC, PASM etc). I've had many dedicated sports cars over the years but currently do not have the luxury of keeping one around purely as a weekend car. \n\nCayennes really have everything you look for in a car, safety, fantastic handling and performance for a big vehicle and exceptional comfort for relaxed driving, plus reasonable economy for what they are.\n\nOriginally I hoped to pick up a GR Corolla as a somewhat economical performance/DD car, unobtanium. Golf R? Unobtanium at sticker, but a really great car, very Porsche-lite. So I expanded my search a bit, I drove the Acura Integra... garbage for the price. An Integra at 28k? Sure maybe, but at 40k? No way. As a primary daily driver, I wasn't looking for a manual, the CVT totally ruins any sporting characteristics of the Acura, the CVT is truly abhorrent.  Subaru WRX? ABSOLUTE shit box, 20ish MPG and it doesn't even handle well, also basically 40k, at least the Integra has a pretty nice interior, my old commuter 2010 Prius had a better interior than the brand new WRX.\n\nOn a whim, after seeing the 10k over sticker at the local VW dealership for the Golf R, I stopped in the Tesla place next door and took the Model 3 out. It was IMMEDIATELY clear this car is so far beyond anything in its price range its an absolute joke. \n\nSteering feel is huge for me personally, and right away I was shocked that it was... pretty damn good! Is it Porsche level? Not quite... but \"not quite Porsche level\" is an insane compliment for most cars. \n\nMy current Cayenne is tuned and fast as hell, its about 3.8 to 60mph. I ended up with a LR AWD which is technically a bit slower, but it doesn't really feel slower. Past 80-90mph? Sure the Cayenne really takes off vs the Model 3 but everyone knows Model 3s are quick, no need to go in depth about that. Concise version, not really a downgrade from a 500+HP twin turbo Porsche, albeit a porky one. \n\nHandling and brakes? The Model 3 LR AWD can't really compete with the total package of adjustable air suspension, Porsche's brilliant adaptive dampers, dynamic chassis control combined with 315 width Pilot Sport tires anchored by absolutely massive brakes. But for the price? Its ACTUALLY a drivers car. It blows away the WRX, Integra (non Type-S), BMWs in its price range etc. \n\nAt its price point you can get an used older last gen Cayman/Boxster/M car, a new Miata or GR86. Those are the only things that have a bit more drivers car cred than the Model 3. Yes, I am ignoring used Corvettes, Camaro 1LTE, Mustangs etc, I know they can be fantastic but... no.  \n\nI didn't touch on the Taycan but they are in a totally different price bracket, even high mileage used examples. The EV tech is behind the Model 3 for the most part, even ignoring charging network, total non-starter for me. I have no doubts a kitted out Taycan is better than the Model 3 but its basically double the price for a used example that MIGHT have the proper options to truly eclipse the Tesla. Pricing out a NEW Taycan that I would by any metric rather have is $120k. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.\n\nLong story short, the Model 3 absolutely shits on ANYTHING in its price bracket, ICE or electric. \n\nNow to the negatives... man... as soon as I clicked accept delivery of the Model 3 I was dropped like a hot potato. The delivery experience was horrible. In fact, it was non existent. The delivery lady pointed across the parking lot, pointed out a Camry and said its over there by that car, you can watch some videos in the car... and then literally almost ran away. I stood there for a bit dumbfounded. At the time of delivery I had spent maybe 20 minutes in a base model test driver car and had no idea how anything worked. \n\nI immediately found a massive gap between the window and B pillar, checked it in to service before even opening the doors after chasing down an employee. A few other doors are quite poorly aligned but I expected this and wasn't bothered. I did not know I had already accepted the car in the app... in my opinion I felt duped by the Tesla app into accepting the car. I should have been more careful. \n\nThe next day I actually drove the car home, the window B pillar gap looked better in the parking lot, I had no reason to expect that hadn't actually repaired the car. \n\nThey didn't repair the car. \n\nPerhaps they pulled the door molding out a bit so the gap wasn't immediately obvious, but definitely did not attempt to fix the issue, or fix and test drive to car to verify it was indeed fixed like the Tesla app stated. \n\nIn fact, they didn't even close out the work order days later so I couldn't make a new service request without a 45min long phone call trying to explain the issue and finally have someone click a button to fix the problem. As of right now, the issue still isn't resolved and the wind noise is unbearable without music playing. I have a mobile appointment upcoming in which I HOPE they will fix the issue. I figured out how to fix it own my own with some googling but I'm not breaking out the wrenchs just yet to fix a brand new car. \n\nAs of writing this, I still have gotten zero replies to any text messaged questions or concerns sent in the Tesla app since taking delivery and it took about 90 painful minutes on the phone to get a service appointment. \n\nTL;DR: Absolutely fantastic hardware and performance that is untouchable at its price point. Terrible experience so far post delivery. I knew what I was I was getting myself into with Tesla, great product, shit company, **the pros definitely outweigh the cons at its price point** but wow... a few tweaks and the ENTIRE experience could truly be next level. \n\nPostscript: I won't be getting rid of a Porsche anytime soon. When I have the freedom, I'll go back to a 911 or a Cayman from my Cayenne. Why? Because the driving enthusiast community experience is built into owning ANY Porsche, from a ratted out ancient 944,  6 year old base model Macan, to a brand new 911 GT3 RS, you can show up to events big and small without prejudice. I'm active in the PCA and nothing can replace a 400 mile day of canyon driving with a bunch of like minded individuals. I haven't searched in depth but haven't found anything like PCA events for Teslas, this is ignoring the fact that big canyon days behind the wheel aren't really as feasible with an EV at this point in time.\n\nAt the end of the day, any Porsche with the proper performance options from Cayenne to Cayman is a more satisfying drivers car, I doubt anyone but the biggest stans would argue that... but its shocking how close Tesla is with the Model 3 relative to its current price point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "text": "I'm in Louisiana and was just hit by a major hurricane and was out of power for about 70 hours.  While my city was spared with avoiding serious damage, being out of electricity in the summer heat here is dangerous.  Heat index the past few days was at 100 degrees, and my house's temperature was in the mid 80s at night.\n\nHaving a Tesla was a HUGE benefit.  I charged the battery to 90% before the storm and slept in the car for 2 nights in camp mode.  In the worst of the heat, when my fans running around the house on generator power wasnt enough to keep cool I put me and my 3 dogs in the car and cooled off watching netflix for a bit.  Talk about handy when you spend 3 days just covered in sweat.\n\nOther major bonus - the Tesla supercharger was available so I could charge my car with just a little wait time.  Right now, gasoline is VERY hard to come by and people search for operating gas stations and wait for hours hoping they can find some for their vehicles and to keep powering their generators.  I was able to charge up to full, drive an hour away from areas hit by the hurricane and fill up a couple more gas cans to deliver to people in need.  \n\nIf anyone is near Ida's path and is looking to help, these folks need gasoline the most. Neighbors are sharing gas and generators where possible, but the scarcity of gas is really crazy right now. Water, food and other supplies are also good.",

      "title": "Model 3 LFP Review after 60k miles",
      "text": "Hopefully this post will provide some info/context to anyone considering purchasing an LFP Model 3. I\u0019ll keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI took delivery of my LFP Model 3 on February 21, 2022. I drive a LOT for work, and I chose the Model 3 for the potential gas savings and autopilot. I\u0019ll share my actual savings below as well as degradation and repairs.\n\n**Battery Degradation:**\n\nAs of today, I\u0019ve driven just over 60k miles. I\u0019ve experienced roughly 4% degradation in this time. Brand new, the car showed 272 miles of range. It now shows 261. This has not impacted my daily driving in any way. I charge to 100% every day. Electricity is a flat $0.09/KwH in my area. I live in the south, so winters are moderate.\n\n**Range Anxiety:**\n\nI would comfortably trust this car for \\~190 miles on the highway at highway speeds (80mph) during the summer. During the winter, 140-150 miles. Far less than the advertised range. For me, I don\u0019t mind stopping every 2.5-3 hours to charge. I would normally stop for bathroom breaks and to stretch my legs, so this isn\u0019t a huge deal to me. That being said, if money were no object, I would go with the long range. More for the charging speeds than range. This car is limited to 170KW supercharging, while long range models can charge at 250KW. Faster charging would be nice.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nRepairs are minimal with this car, but I\u0019ve had a few.\n\n1: The most significant issue was a drive unit failure. The car just suddenly failed on me during a road trip - I couldn\u0019t drive the car at all. Thankfully this occurred while parked. I had to get the car towed to the nearest service center (90 miles away). Took Tesla about 3 weeks to fix. They paid for the repair and my rental car during this process. No issues since.\n\n2: I\u0019ve had the seal repaired on both front windows three separate times. I was experiencing significant wind noise, and replacing the window seals has yet to fix the issue completely; it\u0019s \\~ 80% better, but I suspect the front windows are misaligned on the track within the door, causing an imperfect seal when fully rolled up, thus causing wind noise at high speeds. Not an issue for city driving. I\u0019ve decided it\u0019s no longer worth trying to fix and I just deal with it.\n\n3: I\u0019ve replaced tires once in 60k miles, costing roughly $1600. I didn\u0019t rotate tires properly during this period causing my back tires to wear rapidly. Tesla recommends rotating tires every 6000 miles or so.\n\n4: I had the back glass replaced due to a rock cracking it. \\~$800 repair.\n\n5: not technically a repair, but it cost me $1300 to have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet at my house. My mobile connector was included with the car at the time of purchase, but Tesla no longer includes these for free. This will add \\~$250 to your charging installation cost.\n\nNow onto savings. My previous vehicle was a 2014 Ford Fusion Energi (plug in hybrid) which got around 40mpg when running in hybrid mode. Over the last year according to the Tesla app, based on gas prices in my area and my previous car\u0019s MPG, I\u0019ve saved around $2200. Not quite the savings I was looking for, but if you\u0019re switching from a less fuel efficient vehicle your savings would be better. Gas is roughly $3.20 in my area as of Sept 18th 2023.\n\n**Things to consider when purchasing:**\n\nI live in a small town, and none of my local tire shops will accept any Teslas for tire rotations. The nearest Tesla service center is two hours away. This won\u0019t be an issue for me 99% of the time, but for any repairs larger than a tire rotation, I would have to drive two hours to have my car worked on. Thankfully, Tesla mobile service alleviates most issues. I can have my tires rotated for around $70 with mobile service. (Yes I will be doing this myself in the future, I\u0019ve since purchased the required tools)\n\nTLDR; After 60k miles, I\u0019ve experienced 4% degradation in my Model 3 LFP. 272mi -&gt; 261mi. I charge to 100% every day. I\u0019ve experienced range anxiety one time in 60k miles, but I drive an abnormal amount. Repairs have been minimal. Best car I\u0019ve ever owned, but if I could do it again I\u0019d get the long range for faster charging speeds.",

Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect [5-star safety rating](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa) as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government.\n\nIn addition, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which offers 240 miles of range, a top speed of 140 mph, 0-60 mph acceleration of just 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior.\n\nTo achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only. You can now buy a Tesla in North America via your phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn\u0019t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free. With the highest consumer satisfaction score of any car on the road, we are confident you will want to keep your Model 3.\n\nShifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. The important thing for customers in the United States to understand is that, with online sales, anyone in any state can quickly and easily buy a Tesla.\n\nAt the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you, rather than you coming to us. Moreover, we guarantee service availability anywhere in any countries in which we operate.\n\nWe\u0019re also excited to announce that we\u0019re implementing a number of firmware upgrades for both new and existing customers. These upgrades will increase the range of the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 to 325 miles, increase the top speed of Model 3 Performance to 162 mph, and add an average of approximately 5% peak power to all Model 3 vehicles.\n\nTesla is committed to making not just the best electric cars, but the best cars, period. And our products are the reason we continue to [rank #1 in Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/10-most-satisfying-cars-owner-satisfaction/) and have every single year since Tesla was first eligible to be included in 2013.

I live in Iowa and it\u0019s winter now (anywhere from 10-40 degrees Fahrenheit) so I expected the range to decrease and I\u0019m willing to deal with the decreased range in the winter but I\u0019m not even getting 200 miles from a 90% full battery. I just drove ~65 miles and my battery went from 90% to 56% and I didn\u0019t have heat on for half the drive. If we want the mass transition to EVs as we all do cause we are part of this group, I\u0019d say the battery capacity needs to at least double to convince the average Joe or Jane to buy an EV. The car is great but I wouldn\u0019t recommend the car to anyone that doesn\u0019t want to deal with the drawbacks of the car -- range. It works great for daily driving, leave come back home plug in and wake up to a full car but road-trips are far from ideal compared to an ICE car. Something I\u0019m willing to deal with because I love the car but I don\u0019t see the majority of the population adopting EVs until chargers are more readily available and possibly charge faster. Just a thought and I\u0019d be interested to see if anyone else agrees/disagrees and why.",

      "title": "My 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; AKA whatever the opposite of brevity is. ",
      "text": "Here's my 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; an exercise in word vomit.\n\n**Review context:** Over a decade of driving Audis, a 2019 B9 S5, a 2015 B8.5 S4, and a 2010 B8 A5. The B9 S5 and B8.5 S4 could not have been more different in temperament. The S4, with a 6-speed manual, was an absolute thrill. Pulling to redline was a neck hair standing crescendo of supercharger whine and unadulterated exhaust noise. The B9 S5, with the ZF8 was the polar opposite, a wave of torque that died out above 5k RPMs and an exhaust note that rivalled a belabored wet fart. Don't get me wrong, the B9 was an ultra comfortable highway cruiser, with the capabilities to carve up the twisties, it just really became an appliance to and from work 99% of the time, with 1% side dish of fahrvergnügen. I have a Mk1 Volkswagen to drive for fun, so I didn't really need my daily to be a true driver's experience. The B9 elapsed its warranty, and with the impending prospect of new tires, new brakes, a 50k service, coupled with all the reports of rocker arm failures, I decided it was time to abandon U-boat and apply those funds to something new.\n\n**Ordering Experience / Delivery:** Both the S5 and S4 sort of found me. My Audi sales manager knew my preference for any color as long as it was gray, sport package equipped, late run S cars. He'd often call me when he would have a leftover, typically in the middle of winter, when he couldn't sell a car on summer tires to anyone other than a moron *(me)*. Entire car purchase on both the S5 and S4 took no more than 3 days, and were completely painless. Ordering a Tesla was as far from that process as you can get, granted it was generally what I had expected. I placed my order for the M3P on April 25th after watching the Jason Camissa and Top Gear reviews at 1am. Not being able to \"haggle\" with the dealer, let alone communicate with a human being was strange. The only time I communicated with what I thought was a human *(likely ChatGPT)*, was via Tesla app texts, typically them requesting documents or further ownership info. The estimated delivery date changed no less than 9 times, an Action Park \"Alpine Slide\" of emotions I'd have preferred not to have rode. My trade in estimate expired 3 times, however the trade in value remained the same from 4/24 through my pickup on 7/5, since I did not exceed the allotted 1000 miles. This kept me right-side-up enough to cover T,T,L,A and FMP of the Tesla. Carmax offered me $800 more, but the tax offset made this a pointless endeavor. Delivery was the first time I talked to a human being, a wide eyed late 20 something who clearly consumed entirely too much espresso *(and Elon Koolaid)* before he came to work. At the recommendation of other Tesla owner's I did not sign any final documents, or pay the \"final payment\" until after I inspected the car. I had been expecting the worst during inspection, after reading numerous horror stories on FB and reddit, however the only issue with the vehicle was a scratch on the carbon spoiler, which Tesla will be replacing free of charge at the end of the month.\n\n**Now onto the '24 M3P itself:**\n\n**Exterior / Styling:** I had always had my eye on the pre-Highland M3P, but the lack of differentiation from lower spec models kept me from taking the plunge. I really appreciate the unique front bumper, front splitter, rear diffuser and rear spoiler. I also think the Highland headlights and tail lights look much more refined in their styling. The lack of fog lights is a bummer, but I also felt the same with the lack of fogs on the S5, no biggie. The dimensional comparison between S5 and the M3P are almost identical, albeit the M3P is 2\" taller. I will say, the '24 M3P styling is enough to make me look over my shoulder when I walk away from it. I find the M3P to look aggressive, yet stealth, which is right up my alley. The little features and details do it for me. It's by no means Pininfarina or Giugiaro penned, but I think it has a clean modern aesthetic, especially with the new lights and bumpers.\n\n**Suspension:** Wow. I'm wholly impressed. Where the B9, that also rode on 30 series tires, felt harsh, clamoring over rode imperfections, the M3P feels so well sorted in comfort or sport suspension setting. Someone described hitting a bump in the M3P as \"one and done\" and that could not be more accurate. There is a marked difference between \"comfort and \"sport\", but neither are too far at the end of the spectrum. \"Sport\" definitely increases compression dampening, which influences body roll *(or lack there of)* but remains compliant and comfortable. In comparison, the S5, with dampers set to \"sport\", was liking having shocks filled with portland cement; I used that setting all of 3 times in my 4.5 years of ownership.\n\n**Chassis:** The low center of gravity of the M3P also contributes to the \"on rails\" feeling. Where the S5 window seals would sound like the intro to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\", creaking and groaning entering my driveway, the M3P makes not a peep. This indicates to my Neanderthal brain that the chassis is stiffer, a feat when you consider the entirety of the M3P roof is glass. On one \"bit too enthusiastic\" *(re: entirely too fast)* entry through a concrete paved exit ramp, the coefficients of friction and adhesion were communicated well through the car, the seat, and directly into my clenched *(yet perfectly cooled, more on that later)* derriere.\n\n**Steering:** On my mindless commute, I tend to forget how noncommunicative modern power steering is, however one drive in the Mk1 reminds me the fact that a steering wheel can tell you, in braille, what is is happening at the interface of rubber and road. The M3P and S5 are equally numb; you're feeling so faithless, lost under the surface, you just can't feel it there *(Chester Bennington croons in background)*. Ratio wise, the M3P feels a bit sharper than the S5, especially on turn-in. Turn the wheel, the nose tips in quickly and without drama. Lock to lock, there are less turns in the M3P, but similar resolution and control. In normal driving, the M3P's \"Light\" setting is perfect, for spirited driving \"Medium\" adds just enough preload to keep from being too darty. \"Heavy\" is akin to the the tiller at the helm of Moby Dick's Pequod, entirely too weighty, severely delaying steering inputs. I will likely never use that forearm vein bulging setting, due to the heft, which is pretty incredible when I'm reminded of the fact that the steering rack in the Mk1 has been failing and ejaculating fluid onto my garage floor for the better part of the last 3 years.\n\n**Power:** There is no comparison here. The S4 and S5 were by no means slow cars, I'd even say you could consider them fast when compared to most cars on the road *(F35 catapulted from the deck of a carrier when compared to the Mk1)*. The M3P is otherworldly. Instantaneous torque is an understatement, \"Ohm my f\\*cking god\" is more accurate. Acceleration builds just as quickly as the throttle pedal changes angle. My first time using \"Insane\" mode, which is so aptly named, caught me off guard and strained a muscle in my neck. Passengers have squealed in delight, excitement, and or *(mostly)* fear, gripping the seat base bolsters and door handle to stabilize themselves. I have driven 911 turbos, M3s, M4s, M5 and M8 competitions in anger *(thanks BMW Track Days!),* and while on paper, those cars have similar acceleration times, there is nothing that compares to the rapid torque delivery of an electric performance car. Yellow traffic lights? If you can see it, you can make it before you squeeze the tomato. The M3P is unwavering in pull up to the \\~110 or so miles per hour I've gotten it up to, with no interruptions for gear changes. I have no instrumented documentation, but I fully believe the 2.9 second 0-60 and sub 11 second quarter mile. It is a thrill, even sans a screaming cacophony of internal combustion, however, you are missing the auditory reference point to gauge speed. The acceleration is cocaine level addicting, and I need to keep Randy S. Alpert Esq., my faithful traffic attorney, whom I've previously funded braces for his children's teeth, at the ready on speed dial.\n\n**Interior:** While I dig the minimalist design, I had been having anxiety over a lack of dash cluster since long before delivery, contemplating adding an aftermarket screen to satiate my need for through the steering wheel data. 10 minutes of driving, that need was gone. The speedo at the corner of the main screen is in your periphery and was easy to adjust to. The lack of signal stalks on the other hand took longer to break 25 years of muscle memory to get used to. While the turn signal buttons are easy enough to use with the pad or side of the thumb, I still occasionally find myself reaching for a stalk that isn't there. I won't pontificate on the fact that all controls are through the screen, other than it must be purgatory for anyone aged boomer or above, as you are essentially driving a rolling smart phone. The seats are comfortable, and supportive, but at 6'3\" and 200lbs, I think I am right at the limit of what can fit between the bolsters, which were adjustable on the S5. My brother, a man of oxen-like man, at 5'9\", \\~270, plainly did not fit in the seats and mushed the seat bolsters to my chagrin. With not nearly as many adjustments as the Audi seats, which were awkwardly flat in shape, I was able to easily find a comfortable position in the M3P's contoured and supple seats. The air conditioned seats, which were not available in my Audis, are a welcomed addition to someone that would describe their basal state as diaphoretic. My significant other, whom while wearing a sundress, referred to them as feeling like \"menthol for your labia\" and I cannot stop chortling about that. Fit, finish and materiality is markedly better than the pre-Highland Model 3s I've driven / rode in. I would say I am generally impressed with the interior that is on par with the Audi quality I have become accustomed to. The addition of full acoustic glazing makes it a quiet place to be, though I rarely notice this due to what is underscored in the next section. I will say, I do miss having massaging seats, but I think that's a fair trade for icy angels singing sweet sonnets upon my sweaty taint. The only other cons I can think of are a lack of operable sunroof and a glass roof that allows heat to build in the interior faster than an air fryer can preheat for my late night dino nuggets. Thank the 'Lon for the ability to precondition from my phone.\n\n**Audio:** All 3 of my Audis were equipped with the Bang Olufsen sound system option. They were never impressive, with a lack of bass and a tinny sound that made the money thrown towards that option seem better spent on the aforementioned cocaine addiction. The Tesla in comparison is amazing. Weighty, mirror jiggling, bass, crisp highs; I've yet to find a track that has overextended the speaker cones. Of all the features, the M3 audio system caught me most off guard, I was not expecting such a strong sound system. Thoroughly impressed and soon in need of an audiologist.\n\n**Build Quality:** I guess time will tell here. I can say, the doors close with a satisfying thud akin to the German cars I've owned. Materials feel generally of high quality. The paint finish on the other hand is not of German car quality, with minor, yet noticeable, orange peel when viewed at oblique angles. On my example, panels gaps, while not post-Third Reich tight, are completely acceptable for a car of this price point. However, I can report that on a trip down the drive-thru line at Sonic for cherry limeades, the wheel aero covers make a highly annoying clicking / clacking noise. I will likely remove the covers this weekend. I can also report, the cup holders easily secure 44 fluid ounces of fast food beverage.\n\n**Summary:** All-in-all, I am very satisfied with the M3P. It is a dutiful appliance to get me to work, while still having the power and agility to provide some thrills. In the first 250 miles, I have saved $50 in fuel alone *(thanks free charging at work).* The reviews that led me to take the plunge, in my experience, are completely accurate. If I had to list my biggest complaint, it's the stigma of people thinking I'm an Elon supporter just by driving one. I love the movie \"The Hateful Eight\", does that make me a Harvey Weinstein supporter?\n\nI'll likely edit and add to this, as my fingers and brain fascia have become fatigued, but anyway, thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0imtz7kywbd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f779a4d5db1fd99b2ca22a00c429f88ca12887ca",

I\u0019ve driven a 911 and this feels comparable and better than my last car, which was a Cayenne. \n\nMy only gripe is the garage door opener, which is now an after market purchase and trip to the service center for installation.

      "text": "We are excited to celebrate our one year anniversary of taking delivery of the Model 3, LR, AWD with 18\u001d aero wheels.  The car is beyond fun to drive and the car\u0019s feedback loop is continually making the car better.  Over the past year we have given demo rides to numerous friends, family members, co-workers, early adapters in our community and even some who have simply stopped to ask questions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq5ocjetbnf31.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d195b4fe9839bdc64575950d23b1d06d91cece60\n\nPeople often ask us about range anxiety and maintenance costs. To celebrate our experience we offer you our one year summary:\n\nWe took delivery on August 10th, 2018\n\nPut snow tires on at 6,800 miles (we live in a rural area)\n\nRotated snow tires at 13,000 miles\n\nPut summer tires back on 19,700 miles\n\nRotated summer tires at 27,000 miles.  We will replace our summer tires next spring when we take our snow tires off.\n\nFilled windshield washer fluid twice.\n\nChanged cabin air filter at 28,500 miles.  Note this was completed by Tesla\u0019s Mobile Service saving us a six-hour, round trip to our closest service center in Eden Prairie, MN at no extra cost!\n\nWe have washed our Model 3 more over one year\u0019s time than we had all our previous cars put together!\n\nNormally we charge at home at night using a NEMA 14-50 outdoor wall plug that uses off-peak power.  We love waking up to a car that\u0019s charged to meet our daily needs whether that is a 65% charge or 100% charge.  During the last year we have super charged 79 times for a total cost of $449.88. Our average cost per charge was $5.70 and our average super charging time has been 32 minutes.  We also used destination chargers at lodging facilities and two RV parks to charge in remote areas.\n\nDuring our trips, we used \u001cA Better Route Planner\u001d and loaded it into the car\u0019s computer to display on the screen.  We personalized the planning data based upon our current situation (average wh/mi, temperature, wind, road conditions). We set our lower battery arrival level at 20% to cover for unknown elevation changes and weather conditions (temperature, precipitation and wind).  Using their recommendations, we selected superchargers or destination chargers from the Tesla listings.  Most of our miles have been driven on Enhanced Autopilot.  \n\nOur lifetime wh/mile for the year is unknown but we started with TeslaFI on January 1st, 2019.  Since that time TeslaFI has tracked 17,350 miles with a 269 wh/mile average with our average temperature being 55 degrees F.  Over the same time period, our battery has degraded 2.4%  Since January, we have received 8 over the air updates averaging 22 days between each update.  \n\nOne of our most memorable experiences was while we were supercharging at the Flying J Travel Center in Fort Stockton, Texas.  A father came up with his twelve-year old son while we were eating in the Travel Center.  He asked if were were the owners of the Model 3.  It was the first one they\u0019d seen.  The son knew everything about the specs of the Model 3.  They both smiled as we showed them our car.  His son\u0019s knowledge, excitement and pure joy in witnessing an all-electric vehicle gave us hope for the future.\n\nThis photo was taken at Inspiration Point, located 2 miles west of Lanesboro, MN.",

      "title": "Lyft/Uber Experiences",
      "text": "So last week I took over from my wife driving for Lyft part time with our Tesla (she gets anxiety around strangers and I don't get a lot of chance to drive the car, so win/win). I'd love to heard some experiences from others that are doing the same thing; interesting rides, passenger responses, etc. Here's a summary of what I have noticed so far:  \n\n\n1. Something like 95% comment on how nice the car is and how much they like the inside. The other 5% are those that barely speak English or are otherwise quiet on the whole ride looking at their phone.\n2. Only about 2-3% have ever been in a Tesla before\n3. A good 30% , including many that know its a Tesla, still think it uses Gas/is a hybrid of some kind\n4. Everyone is amazed when I tell them how much it costs me to charge fully at home (and really I'm saving $50 on my electric bill compared to before the Tesla thanks to Utah's tiered program that's only available with electric cars)\n5. Just as with cost to charge, no one realizes how affordable it is, even when i mention the one i had was 47k they are amazed. Many think they are still around 100k.\n6. The best ride I've given so far regarding someone excited about the car was to this sweet old guy who apparently does daily trips across town to be with his wife. He was one of the few that I was able to show the acceleration too and wanted to see it (I wont do it unless someone asks/I can do it safely). He said he wished they had him when he younger as he would have definitely bought one. His son just got a Model S but he hasnt gotten to ride in it yet.",

      "title": "Thoughts after first 5k miles with 23 M3P",
      "text": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the M3P I purchased earlier this year and wanted to share some thoughts for anyone thinking of jumping in.  \n\nI'll start with some dislikes first:\n\nPaint - I went with white because it's free and because I live in the desert where any other color is going to get nuclear hot in a short time.  The paint on delivery was pretty much fine - no obvious defects other than a tiny spot on the hood where there was some contaminant under the paint.  But in just under 5k miles, the front bumper looks like absolute hell.  Chips galore, almost all down to the black plastic underneath.  The fremont paint is pretty worthless at standing up to the tiniest of rocks.  You can either accept that you'll need a repaint, or do PPF.  \n\nBasic Autopilot / Autosteer Beta - Utterly embarassing.  Coming from a Volvo with PA, the ADAS in the Tesla feels horribly implemented.  Phantom braking galore, freaks out when lanes widen, etc.  It's just not predictable, which is a must when you're designing a system of this type.  I really dislike that it automatically disables with even minor steering input - there's a pretty fine line between the amount of steering input required to let the system know you're there and the amount that immediately disables autosteer.  I don't think this is going to get much better down the road either, between the hardware that's missing and the fact they've already been working on it so long and are yet so far behind other manufacturers.  Not a huge deal for me, as I really only use it on long road trips, and it's not nearly as bad on the interstate as it is on highways.\n\nWheels - The uberturbines are kind of cool looking, but that's about it.  I'm going to get some 18s to replace them.  Looking forward to a smoother ride and better economy.\n\nSound - Cabin noise levels aren't terrible, but without a gas powered white noise generator directly in front of you, road noise is a lot more apparent. I put in the front wheel well insulation from RPMTesla and slapped some dynamat inside the front fender while I was at it and it made a huge difference.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nInterior - Wasn't sure how I'd feel about the single screen situation, but it has been pretty seamless.  The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the audio is great.  0 rattles or squeaks have manifested so far.\n\nPrice of ownership - Electricity is pretty cheap where I live (12.5 cents/kwh) so my costs to keep it running with at home level 2 have been minimal.  I've done 79% of my charging at home and only 21% at superchargers.  While my supercharging rate is nearly 4x more expensive (42 cents/kwh), it's not exactly breaking the bank to top off on road trips.\n\nPerformance - Hard to not smile when you floor it.  Braking could be improved, but coupled with max regen is perfectly adequate.  Steering feels precise and has good feedback.  Tiny gripe is that the turning circle feels pretty wide given the overall size of the car, but it isn't something I notice much.\n\nInfrastructure - Out west, supercharging makes ownership extremely easy.  0 range anxiety on any of my trips.  The only place I've looked into going where it might be a hassle is a long roadtrip to Yosemite from east of the park - there's just not a lot of options around there.  \n\nOverall I'm very happy with my purchase and think this vehicle is tough to beat as a daily commuter.  It's a strange package altogether to be sure - midrange price, miniscule cost to own, accelerates like a solid rocket, and farts on demand?  \n\nAnyway, longish post, hope this helps anyone considering a purchase.",

      "text": "Hi everybody! As the title states, I was given the surprising news last week that I would be getting a Model 3, an exceedingly generous graduation gift that I absolutely did not expect and do not deserve. I had been planning on buying myself a Toyota Yaris next year, lol!\n\nAnyhow, delivery is expected in March! I chose the midnight silver metallic color, black interior, and aero wheels.\n\nMy questions for the community are:\n\n- I live in the Bay Area, but currently do not have access to a charger for overnight in my living space. Is this going to be a big issue?\n\n- What was the learning curve like for you switching to electric? I\u0019ve never driven anything but gas powered vehicles.\n\n- How difficult are the wheel caps accessories to put on? I\u0019d like to remove the aero covers but heard installation can be tricky. (EDIT: I am extremely embarrassed to find out how simple this was >!)\n\n- Is there anything you wish you knew before you\u0019d purchased your Model 3? I\u0019m all ears!\n\nAny info is appreciated, thank you! :)\n\nEDIT: Yes it was a college graduation, not high school, dear lord that would be even more obscene. Also, I\u0019m 28 years old so I\u0019m a more experienced driver than younger graduates, which I think played a tiny part in all this.\n\nEDIT 2: Wow! I\u0019m floored at how welcoming you have all been and the amazing tips and advice I\u0019ve been given, you went in to so much more detail than I ever expected and I\u0019m so grateful!\n\nI was a bit nervous posting here and including the fact that it was a gift for fear of being judged or written off as some spoiled brat, but figured it was important to add because otherwise I\u0019m sure people would have just asked why I didn\u0019t do more research before buying the car, haha! Anyhow, thanks again everyone!\n\nP.S. & As icing on the cake, my delivery was just bumped up to January-February, so I\u0019m stoked!",

      "title": "Tesla Model 3 Winter Range - My Experience",
      "text": "A frequent question in this forum is about range in winter, so I wanted to share some of my data that I have accumulated over the past 4.5 years with my 2018 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD (pre-heat pump), living near Minneapolis, MN. It\u0019s not quite Canadian weather here, but I feel I can be a pretty good barometer for colder climates.\n\nFirst, a little background on the data I collect. I have been trying my hardest to take a picture of my odometer and clear my trip meter on the first of every month. I then enter the data into an Excel spreadsheet with some accompanying data like the average gas price, electricity cost, and temperature stats for that month. This gives me some good long-term stats and a great graph to back up my temperature related observations.\n\n[Graph from tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/whef6z9ytzma1.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de267d66d3ef4e63bff8c9a01fac9a428bee6bb9)\n\nLet me first dismiss the common misconception that in winter, \u001cyou can automatically expect a 30%-40% range loss.\u001d Sure, you can have a drive here or there where the range loss is bad, but when you look at the averages for an ***entire month***, you will see in my graph that the only times I ***ever*** got that low was during the 2019 POLAR VORTEX weather event. Let me remind everyone those two months it was abnormally cold where at one point the actual air temp got down to -27° F and stayed there for almost a week.\n\n[My tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/52ap5jyfuzma1.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95dd0f1a39b9307eb4356bc6e5b1e0aec6c2d61d)\n\nBack to the spreadsheet data, if you calculate the range loss from NOV through MAR for the last 5 winters combined, it averages to a -17.53% loss. (Not so bad considering the average internal combustion engine typically drops between [\\-15%-24% in the winter too](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/coldweather.shtml).)\n\nHere is another interesting observation from my spreadsheet. According to the EPA\u0019s web site, my Model 3 has a blended rating of 290 Wh/mi (29kWh/100 mi). Much to my surprise, the spreadsheet\u0019s calculations back that up with 290.03 Wh/mi over the life of my vehicle.\n\nDigging into the graph a bit more, each blue dot on the graph is the average monthly temperature versus the average watt hours per mi achieved during each month. You will see that I also added a green EPA rating line at 290, a blue 32° F freezing line, and a purple trendline for the blue dots. \n\nThe purple trendline crosses the EPA rating at right about 43° F. This means the when the average temp for the month is over 43° F, that I usually got ***better*** than the EPA rating. When the temp is under 43° F, my Wh/mi was typically in the 300-350 range, I assume because I only have the PTC resistance heater and no heat pump. What I have noticed anecdotally, is that when the temperature is between 65°-75° F, that is the sweet spot for efficiency. For August 2019, called out on the graph, I had a 17.24% ***gain*** in range with nice weather.\n\nIn conclusion, having 30%-40% loss during a ***single trip*** indeed happens, but that drastic of a loss for an ***entire month*** would likely only happen due to some unprecedented weather conditions (think Polar Vortex). \n\nWhen people ask about my range loss in the winter, I am quick to point out that my personal experience is \"actually pretty close to the winter gas mileage losses in my old Toyota Camry.\" Practically speaking, when doing road trips to ND to visit my in-laws in the winter, we usually have to sit at the supercharger for an extra few minutes, but it really isn\u0019t much of a bother.",

      "text": "This car will primarily be used for commuting to work 3 days a week (about 40 miles round trip). Very infrequently, we may use it do day trips (60-300 mile trips). We have a Subaru Forester for everything else.\n\n**Tesla Model 3 - Standard Range Plus** (about $41k all-in)\n\nRange - 263 miles; RWD; 7-13 week delivery\n\n**Tesla Model 3 - Long Range** (about $50k all-in)\n\nRange - 353 miles; AWD; 10-60 weeks delivery\n\n**2021 Honda Clarity Plugin Hybrid** (about $34k all-in, credit takes effective price down to about $27k)\n\n$7500 federal tax credit available\n\nRange: 47 miles (electric), 340 (combined); FWD\n\nThoughts on Tesla:\n\n* (+) Teslas offer over-the-air software updates that improve range/power/etc\n* (+) Tesla offers the fast-charging ecosystem for longer trips\n* (+) Tesla has a trunk and a frunk (front trunk)\n* (+) Lower cost of maintenance (no combustion engine)??\n* (-) Tesla would probably require an in-home charging unit (extra $1k or so expense)\n\nThoughts on Honda:\n\n* (+) Hybrid relieves anxiety around charge! Easy to go on longer trips without recharging stops.\n* (+) $7500 federal rebate!\n* (+) It seems that Honda is offering better financing (0.9% APR vs 2.49% APR)\n* (+) Less likely to need an in-home charger (though it would still be convenient)\n* (-) Less premium options (e.g., cloth seats)\n* (-) Less cargo space\n* (-) Higher maintenance costs (combustion engine), but still lower than a standard engine\n\nIf I chose a Tesla Model 3, I'm leaning towards the longer range and AWD, but it's an extra $10k. Compare that to the cost of the Honda Clarity with federal rebate ($7500) and it's a $20k difference (though the Clarity is FWD).\n\nConsumer Reports gives both cars similar scores and ultimately recommends both (Honda Clarity has a score of 80; Tesla Model 3 has a score of 78).\n\nIs there anything else I should be considering for a Tesla (both positive and negative)? Anyone else consider the Clarity?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks to everyone for the thoughtful comments!\n\nIt sounds like there are a lot of reasons to buy a Model 3, many of which are intangibles. I'm excited by the low maintenance costs and very inexpensive cost per mile. I'm not a typical car person (drove older Honda Civic's my whole life), but Teslas are far different than typical cars.\n\nI am definitely leaning toward the Model 3 and scheduled a test drive for tomorrow evening! I'm fully expecting to be wow'ed! Given I want the car in the fall, and the delivery times being what they are, I should decide soon!\n\nSince it fits in my budget, I will probably spring for the LR. I live close to Philly and the AWD will come in handy January through March. Plus, the LR will give me a little extra juice in the cold months.\n\nThanks again!",

      "text": "Picked up my Midnight Silver Metallic AWD Tesla Model 3 yesterday (2018-09-25) and wanted to share my experiences in the first 60miles.  Not a lot of time, and only 1 day of ownership, but everyone asks - so I figured I'd tell.\n\nI've been on the reservation list since April 2016, and have been counting every day I've been waiting.  As with almost every other post like this... all I can say is that it is worth the wait.  The car really is everything I wanted it to be.  If you are still in line, just hang tight.  \n\n\n(Quite a lot of information below, so hopefully it answers questions for you.  Feel free to ask questions.  Please give me a little latitude on the flow - I've been writing this in little chunks since last night.  If something isn't clear, let me know and I will update.)\n\n----\n**TL;DR** : TL;DR : Amazing vehicle. PPPPP<\u001f<\u001f (7 out of 5 Stars).   By **far** the most performant, enjoyable, and technologically advanced machine on wheels I've ever been in.  I fly helicopters for fun, and the Model 3 is gives those experiences a run for its money.  Certainly the most exciting vehicle with wheels I've ever been in!\n \n*Images:* [Side View](https://i.imgur.com/rwpqUHy.jpg) , [Interior View](https://i.imgur.com/1zq0MzV.jpg), [Nose View](https://i.imgur.com/FzOVReH.jpg)\n \n----\n\n**Positives / Cool Things**: \n\n* Delivery was fast and painless.  No paint issues to notice. No misaligned panels.  Car seems perfectly built.  Will update if something changes here.\n\n* AWD has incredible torque and pickup.  I've not been able to *open it up* fully yet - but the fact that I could get to 85 in about 100ft was amazing.  Not even a chirp from the wheels when I launched either.\n\n* The sleek interior is perfection.  Nothing to distract your view or your driving experience.\n\n* The display is very impressive.  Driving at night is quite easy by not having the bright dash board right in your visual center (as is with other vehicles).  Automatic dimming is impressive.  A little daunting for the first 30 minutes, but very easily understood and usable.\n\n* Phone Key is a great idea.  Walk up and it turns on. Walk away and it turns off and locks.  Very simple to use.   I was a 2 x Leaf owner (2013 and 2016) and I am used to turning it on and off. So, felt a little weird at first, but I'm sold.  It works.\n\n**Negatives / Odd Things**: \n\n* Automatic Windshield Wipers \u0013 definitely need tuning. Not impressed - and in truth, this is my only real gripe with the car.  The area had torrential rain yesterday, and I found myself moving from Automatic to full-speed wipers manual... often.  Way too often.  Also, towards the end of the storms, the system would not trigger until I was nearly unable to see out of the windshield.\n\n*  The charger door seems a little temperamental when it comes to automatically opening with the charger cable.  Touch always worked for me, but I'm at about 50% with the charger.\n\n* Door handles are awkward.  I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but \"push with your thumb and grab\" is an odd motion for a car.\n\n* Smudgy surfaces everywhere.  Center console display, glossy storage area doors.  I'm not sure I would have gone with glossy surfaces.  I'll probably do a wrap on the console.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n**Delivery:**\n\n* *Summary:  Very efficient and fast delivery out of the Devon, PA dealership.  They were very busy, 4 cars in the out-door, covered delivery bay when I pulled in.  Paperwork was ready, and signing took 5-7 minutes.  Demo, walk-through, initial setup was about 20 minutes.  Then I was in the car, and on my first drive home.*\n\n* Walked in, met an admin who was signing people in.  There were a few people waiting in a seating area, and I was offered coffee and a seat.  I declined (really didn\u0019t need any more caffeine, I was excited enough already), and he told me someone would be with me in 5-10.\n\n* 3-5 minutes later, my Sales Specialist showed up, took us to a table to get a few signatures, review paperwork.  Since 99% of it was already done online, it was mostly a formality.  Got my PA registration documents, and wrapped it up in &lt;10 minutes.  I was asked to wait a bit until my Delivery Specialist was ready.\n\n* We burned 5-10 looking at the Model X.  (My wife got the glimmer in her eyes& so maybe someday.)  Was met on the floor by our Delivery Specialist who walked us out to the covered out-door delivery bay, and proceeded with a quick demo, walk-through, and setup session.\n\n* Started with the key-card lock/unlock process, then right in to getting both of our phones registered with the car, and got my personal settings (seat, mirror and steering wheel) set in the car.  We both had the apps pre-downloaded so it was a fast run through.  Quick overview of the in-car storage, task lighting, and marveled at the clean look, with very little \u001cstuff\u001d \u0013 it is all in the built in display!\n\n* Next, a walk through of the navigation systems, soft-buttons (how to open glovebox, turn on audio, seat heaters, open trunk/frunk, etc).  Touched on most of the setting screens one after another.  To be honest, it was a little too fast for consumption or retention.  But, I\u0019m glad I saw it all with someone there.  Knowing my own style, it did not bother me, I knew I\u0019d be back that night \u0013 in the garage \u0013 to go through it all on my own pace.\n\n* Then a quick demo of the charging door, lights, cables, connectors and adapters.  Kind of surprised they do not have a SuperCharger at the dealership \u0013 I\u0019d call that  pretty big miss on Tesla\u0019s part.  Every dealership should have at least one.\n\n* We ended with the ceremonial photo, and then delivery was done.  About 25 minutes of Demo/walkthrough.  Whole thing took ~30 minutes from rolling in to the dealership to zipping out at Mach 3 in my Model 3.\n\n* *Note*, the Devon, PA Tesla dealership is not permitted to do PA Inspections, so you will have to do that at your local spot sometime in the next 10 days.  Not a big deal, and not Tesla\u0019s fault at all.  This is all due to PA\u0019s bizarre laws alone.\n\n\n**Interior:**\n\n* *Summary:  Interior, while it felt sparse at first glance, it really well designed and integrated with the display.  Clean lines and attention to detail is very clear in this car.  Materials are high quality.  Road noise is minimal.  Audio System is bangin'*\n\n* Visibility is very good.  Side view, rear view mirrors are well placed.  With a little adjustment they cover everything I need to see.  Not able to identify any real blind spots.  I love how the car auto-magically adjusts when a known user gets in.\n\n* Seats are very comfortable.  Firmness and fit is great for me.  Adjustment are sufficient and can give you a great fit.  I recommend taking the time to adjust things a few times to get it right.\n\n* I sit rather low in the car - and that makes entrance and exit less than elegant, so I may need to adjust a little.  Once seated visibility and comfort are fine.\n\n* I was a little shocked by the dash/display in the car.  When you first get in things are suspiciously empty and the display looks imposing.  Likely this is just because you are so used to every other car in existence.  And, in truth, this car is nothing like any car in existence - and as soon as you cross that threshold, there is no coming back.  Once you get comfortable with the interface and the buttons, it makes sense.  So, I guess what I'm saying here is ignore and trepidation you feel in the first few minutes in the car.  It is designed this way for a reason.  Trust in Elon. :)\n\n* I love the amount of *hidden* storage in the car.  Behind every door is a nice space to store things.  And, they all seem to go way far back too.  Same goes with the trunk - pull up the cover, more space!  I'm not a fan of the black gloss doors.  I feel like they will get smudged and scratched.  Only time will tell, but that's my assumption at this point.  I'm looking at the matte black wraps - and I feel like that will do what I really need.\n\n* Audio System sound is fantastic.  Really impressed with the speakers in the car.  Very high end sound, crystal clear, no oddities.\n\n* Back seats are quite comfortable.  Plenty of leg room.  Oddly enough, two people sitting in passenger-rear have had issues putting on the seatbelt and using the center-seat's connector.  They use the shoulder belt, and end up putting it in the wrong socket.  Have not had the issue myself.\n\n* Both front and rear \"open the door\" buttons seem awkward.  People always seem to assume they have something to do with the windows.  Likely just a training issue, but it isn't intuitive at this point.  \n\n* Glass Roof is beautiful.  I've not had a crazy sunny day yet, but light does not seem too much at all.  Tint is appropriate.  Sitting in the back seat gives you the best view of the openness and spacious feeling.  Great design element.\n\n\n**Exterior:**\n\n* Panels are all aligned perfectly.  No issues that I can see at all.\n\n* Paint / Colors / Finish seems perfect.  I really like the Midnight Silver Metallic - it has a great presence.\n\n* Door handles require some odd hand movements to open the car.  Push with your thumb, reach over and pull handle.  This may be something you just get used to, but it does not feel natural.  I appreciate the fact that they are flush with the door - but something isn't entirely fluid about the motions you need to open.\n\n* While I love the frunk/trunk - they should be automatic open on a car in this class.\n\n* Charging port is a great location, and is invisible when not in use - nice touch.  It does seem to be a little temperamental when it comes to opening with the charging handle.  I've only had about a 50% chance of it opening as I approach.  Perhaps I'm not doing it correctly yet.  Touch open/close works 100% of the time.\n\n\n**Driving:**\n\n* Handling - Amazing - like the car is driving on rails.  Tight steering makes the car feel very solid.  I've not gone into too many high speed turns yet, but from the few artificial hard turns, everything stays where it is supposed to.  Sway is minimal.\n\n* Acceleration - OMG - I'm used to the pickup and torque of an electric motor.  Been driving a Nissan Leaf for 6 years.  So, while I expected a difference, I didn't expect this.  I test drove an early RWD, and that was peppy.  This AWD is like a completely different animal altogether.  \n\n* Automatic Breaking / ReGen - This will take a bit getting used to.  Again, Leaf had something similar, but this is a 10x difference.  It goes very heavy on the brake when you let up on the accelerator fully.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, and re-calibrate my single-pedal feathering... but it was a shock.  Come to a light and let up... the car reacts quickly and slows you down.  I know there a other settings to minimize the braking, but I will leave it \"standard\" and see if I can learn the car.\n\n* Distance Sensing / Alerts seem to be a little too conservative for me.  It yells at me when pulling in the garage or backing out. I do understand that it senses distance, and it is surely accurate, but I ended up turning off the chime.  Visual indicator is fine.\n\n* Operation of the Console Display is actually quite easy while driving.  I had thought it would be difficult or distracting.  So far I've not really had issue with it yet.  Most of the settings - once perfected and on Auto - should be set-it-then-forget-it. \n\n* Approach Lock / Unlock is a great feature.  Have to get used to it a little, but I am certainly a fan of the feature.\n\n\nSo, that's it... let me know if you have any questions.\n",

      "title": "The Base Highland Sound System Is Perfectly Fine",
      "text": "I am happy to report back from a Tesla showroom that the Model 3 RWD base sound system is, in fact, best-in-class. \n\nI believe that it competes well with other sound systems in its segment, up to competing sedans/hatchbacks, and on first impression outdoes competitors like the BMW Hi-Fi and Audi base sound systems. \n\nFurthermore, it is on par with if not notably superior to premium audio options offered in the compact EV segment. It outshines the Harman Kardon system I had and loved in an i3, and also the Hyundai IONIQ. I used the joke that it ate the previous-generation Harman Kardon systems for lunch like Billie Eilish. Billie Eilish\u0019s music, which is now used as reference for tuning by audio brands due to the range and popularity of songs like \u001cBad Guy,\u001d shines on the system. \n\nThis isn\u0019t surprising since nine speakers isn\u0019t too far off of a typical 10-12 luxury base/premium audio system, and many modern systems rely on woofers in the door panels rather than a subwoofer to produce bass. Tesla Model 3 RWD has a confident, punchy bass response that extends down into some sub-frequencies without too dramatic of a roll off. Reports that Tesla highlights the midrange frequencies, which brings out clarity and definition in vocals and instruments, are accurate and make the system audiophile-tuned even at the lower bitrate of a service like Deezer. I can\u0019t wait to one day hear Hi-Fi streaming services on the Model 3. \n\nI may admittedly be incorrect on this next observation as I had only test drove both briefly, but I preferred it to a 2018 Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive where I couldn\u0019t get the impact and clarity I was looking for at higher volumes especially with the windows down\u0014Model 3 RWD had no issue with distortion up to its max volume of over 102dB. \n\nNow, the 17-speaker sound system on the 2024 Model 3 Long Rage All-Wheel Drive and Performance is as mind-blowing as the setup would imply: it is absolutely the highest quality of clean, tight, impactful bass I\u0019ve heard from a stock sound system with plenty of clarity and separation across the range. The dual woofers in the doors paired with the dual subwoofers gives the system even more of a \u001cwow\u001d effect that, paired with the rest of the mid-range speakers and tweeters, may outdo nearly every sound system in its class. \n\nI believe that Tesla is targeting a more bass-heavy response than before that places emphasis on the mid-range without making the treble shrill, which quite honestly matches my preference for audio. There was no lack of bass on the RWD, as I could feel my shorts vibrating with both systems; although, more so on the AWD since it has the subwoofers as well as an impressive two additional woofers. Even playing with the EQ makes for changes that seem deliberate rather than random. Tesla did an excellent job with both systems. \n\nThe base Model 3 \u0018Highland\u0019 sound system is perfectly fine, probably phenomenal even and outdoes most base systems from competitors if not many premium audio systems found on other vehicles and especially electric vehicles. Model 3 RWD would almost be too good of a value relative to the market if it had come with such an amazing 17-speaker system. A single subwoofer as Tesla had noted in its initial press release would have made the RWD system perfect; however, it\u0019s not necessarily missed due to the competent performance of the woofers that are there and the difference would be less dramatic between both systems.\n\nModel 3\u0019s premium audio system offered on All-Wheel-Drive/Performance models simply takes the audio experience to another level. It\u0019s like the difference between a Model S Long Range and a Model S Plaid: both will get you there in style and comfort, but only one is insane. To be fair, both systems can be considered premium whereas the complete 17-speaker system is Ludicrous. \n\nOne more note: extra speakers in the back can make the rear display experience better for rear passengers, but isn\u0019t really necessary since there are speakers already and Bluetooth headphones can be paired. \n\nTLDR: Model 3\u0019s RWD system deserves the recognitions of excellence it\u0019s received. Model 3 AWD/Performance takes the sound to Ludicrous levels. Customers should be happy with either option, and there isn\u0019t a need to upgrade due to any lack of quality or fullness in the base RWD system. Nonetheless, the premium for the AWD can be worth it to have one of the best sound systems on the market. ",

      "title": "The One Month Review: Philly Suburbs Edition",
      "text": "So after the first month of owning my Model 3 (SR) in southeastern Pennsylvania, I've already learned quite a few useful tidbits of information about the car itself and its various post-delivery needs. Since some of these things include issues without immediate answers, If figured I'd share my experience for others living in our Tesla-heavy area who haven't yet taken delivery or for those who find other people writing about familiar surroundings enjoyable.\n\n**Pre-Delivery**: So between my initial order and my delivery, I moved from the D.C.-area back to PA. Of course, this was a very stupid move planning-wise for me, as it made the entire delivery process much more complicated than it needed to be. ***DO NOT*** do this if your estimated delivery is in the same general timeframe as your move. I was told, rather explicitly, by my Sales Rep (SA) that I couldn't take delivery of a vehicle with a PA license in Virginia, despite being told the opposite by a salesperson at the Tesla store I purchased from. Thankfully, I had ordered in the store with said SA, and so changing delivery sites was relatively straightforward. Additionally, I needed to update information such as my new Drivers License and Insurance, which I chose to do instead at the Devon location shortly after getting those things. If you're doing this same boneheaded process, I'd recommend just going to a Tesla store to do it instead of talking over the phone.\n\nOther assorted pre-delivery tidbits:\n\n* Carvana gave me an absolute fortune for my previous vehicle. Granted, it was in excellent condition and had low mileage, but thanks to the used car market, I got about 50% more than Kelly Blue Book had quoted me on. Very smooth process selling the car, and I chose to do so before moving to avoid PA's [very dumb vehicle registration process for new residents](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/New-Resident-Relocation-Information/New%20Residents/Pages/Motor-Vehicle-Information-for-New-Residents.aspx) and the associated fees.\n\n* If you do a test drive, I'd highly suggest a route between the Devon and KoP stores. Its a good mix of highway traffic along a short stretch of 202, as well as the type of residential and multi-lane roads you're probably used to driving during your normal routine. Even if you've already ordered a car, I'd strongly recommend doing it if you haven't already to get a feel for how it handles so your first experiences with regen braking aren't in a crowded parking lot with lots of other cars.\n\n**Delivery Day**: While there was some slight panel misalignment and and a few other small cosmetic issues, the delivery was an extremely smooth process. Minus my detailed inspection of the car and personalizing the interface, the total time spent doing paperwork and waiting was approximately 15 minutes. One important thing to note about the Devon location is that it had virtually no parking available. I was thankfully able to get a spot, but I'm pretty sure it was the last one available. Also important to know is that there is only parking on the east side of the service center, the other side appears to be strictly for inventory and was packed to the brim with wrapped up cars awaiting future delivery.\n\n**Post-Delivery**: For PA, there are some interesting things in the immediate post-delivery timeframe that are good to know ahead of time. These include:\n\n* Tesla's PA Service Centers aren't certified for State Inspections. While you'll be provided with a permanent license plate and temp registration on-site, you will need to get the car state inspected within the first two weeks. Schedule this ahead of time. Even more frustrating is that the Model 3, like other Teslas, has special jacking requirements due to the battery underneath. Many traditional auto-repair centers can't/won't service the car because of this, and you should be very cautious about where you take it to ensure your car isn't poorly handled like [/u/bbtow69's poor car was](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/npudzg/is_this_lifted_incorrectly/). Check out this [old Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bxgage/state_inspection_near_devon_pa_service_center/) for some helpful recommendations. The good news (I guess) is that [PA doesn't require an emissions test of electric vehicles](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvspubsforms/BMV/BMV%20Safety%20Inspection%20Bulletins/Safety_Bulletin_BI14-1.pdf).\n\n* If you have the (dis)pleasure of living under PECO's incompetence, they offer you [a whole $50 rebate](https://pecorebateportal.com/electric-vehicles/smart-driver-rebate.html) for your trouble. I'd say go spend it on Phillies tickets, but you should definitely spend it on a [paint repair kit](https://shop.tesla.com/product/paint-repair-kit) instead to cover for [PennDot's mismanagement](https://i.redd.it/576otwicf1t21.jpg) of our roads. More on the *pain* repair kit later.\n\n* Another important note regarding PECO are its peak/off-peak hours. For 2021, the [Super Off-peak hours are Midnight to 6AM, and Peak hours are from 2PM-6PM on weekdays](https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-peco-default-service-tou-rates-time-of-use-20201204.html). A standard rate applies during all other times. **EDIT** This rate does not yet apply, but a plan was proposed and approved in December 2020.\n\n* The Commonwealth itself offers a more substantial BEV incentive of [$750 for new or used vehicles under $50k](https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/grantsloansrebates/alternative-fuels-incentive-grant/pages/alternative-fuel-vehicles.aspx). This is a grant and is not tied to tax returns. However, it's first come, first serve, so get it while you can!\n\n* I had some slight panel misalignment and the plastic trim attached to my passenger-side mirror coming off, noted to the sales rep on delivery day. I didn't realize it, but you also need to separately file a service ticket through the app for this. They ultimately sent out a mobile service tech to fix both, and it was covered under warranty. It took a few weeks to get them out there, so I'd recommend filing the  service ticket on delivery day as soon as you get home.\n\n**The Driving Experience**: So this is (obviously) the best part of owning the car. Here's what I've learned while driving around the area:\n\n* Driving the car with full regen braking is incredibly fun along the winding curves of our area. It feels like a sports car, both in the comfort of the ride and the handling. One pedal driving is especially useful for close curves and hills, and it feels like you have far more control over the vehicle. Because our roads are [a bit special](https://i.redd.it/ypl9rt8y7h571.jpg), you'll likely notice the ride is a bit more bumpy due to the steel spring suspension of the Model 3. While this may be a deal-breaker for those used to a super smooth ride in a luxury vehicle, I've found it to be fine and gives the ride a bit more \"texture\" without the vibration of an ICE engine in front of you. It's simply more noticeable due to the bumpiness of the roads around here, and the potholes can be a bit unnerving. Overall, the car handled these like a champ, and I feel much more in control of my car when driving than I ever did its AWD predecessor. I've heard that potholes can be pretty dangerous for the 19\" and 20\" wheels, so definitely try to avoid those if possible.\n\n* I'd also recommend setting the car to creep or roll for the first hundred miles or so if you aren't used to driving with strong regen braking, as the transition is a bit difficult. Also good to know is that regen braking applies the tail lights at a certain braking threshold, so don't be paranoid like I was and assume you need to apply the brakes as well to avoid getting rear-ended. After you're used to the creep or roll, the transition to \"hold\" will be very smooth and is highly recommended to extend your range.\n\n* Autopilot will work on virtually any road with a median lane marker. Despite actively following Tesla development for nearly a decade, I was under the impression that AP functionality was geofenced to major interstates. Not true. It works on many roads, including rural \"highways\" such as Route 1, but keep in mind that it **will not** stop for stop lights and stop signs like FSD is supposed to. For Route 1 in particular, I wasn't quite ready to let the car handle the high-speed, blind curves around the MD border, so I switched over to manual and had some fun doing the legal speed limit of *55MPH* and still feeling like I'm going too fast. Speaking of country roads, my first major autopilot \"freak out\" occurred when passing an Amish Buggy. While driving on AP, the car saw the Buggy on the right and an oncoming car on the left, and as I drew closer, promptly threw a temper tantrum and kicked me out of AP. Thankfully, I was assuming that the Buggy might cause issues and was already in the process of switching over to manual control. On a later drive through this route without a buggy or oncoming traffic, I discovered that this particular area of road is a hotspot for Phantom Braking, so ultimately it was double-whammy of events. Overall, proceed with the regular amount of caution as you normally would for a buggy.\n\n* I had the joy to discover in late-May that [Tesla had made some important changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31HaTbWONmQ) to my vehicles components after ordering, and would be taking delivery of Tesla-vision vehicle without lumbar support. Outside of my test drive Model 3, I've not had any experiences with a radar-equipped M3, but what I can say is that I've felt quite confident in its ability function in clear conditions. I was also pretty happy to see that the car was receiving updates last week, and appreciated some of the other QOL changes such as the ability to toggle off the auto-brights during autosteer. I'd still prefer being able to outright disable the auto-brights given how bad they are at detection on highways, but for now I think I can deal with the current setup. The lumbar support omission hasn't been much of an issue to my passengers, however I'm still pretty annoyed about the situation.\n\n**Accessories and Other Tidbits**:\n\n* Since we live in a region with, ahem, *Four Seasons*, you'll definitely want to purchase [Splash Guards/Mud Flaps](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-mud-flaps) for your car to [protect the notably poor quality paint](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/55412/tesla-model-3-s-paint-problem-has-a-solution-now/) from salt and gravel spray. It's also recommended to purchase the PPF, but I forgot to add it to my cart that day and can't give a review for it. What I can give a review for are the splash guards and optional mud flaps. The flaps themselves are detachable and hang only about an inch and a half from the ground. I strongly recommend that you don't attach these, as they scrapped along the ground during turns. I have absolutely no idea how Tesla thought these were acceptable to sell to consumers at their current length, but I guess that's what I get for buying a car designed in always sunny, always summer California. The installation process was pretty easy, the only tools needed are a ratchet wrench fitted with a 10MM Hex attachment and a screwdriver to remove the pins on the wheel wells. It took about 20 minutes total to install both, and I'd recommend installing them as soon as you can after deliver to protect from any debris you kick up while driving.\n\n* If you're getting the SR+, the car somehow doesn't come with floor mats despite being a $40K vehicle. Given how many aftermarket floor mats are available, there are a lot of options to choose from. I can't really give a review for the ones I purchased, as I've only had them a month, but I can say you have a wide variety of options to choose from. You'll definitely want to buy something though to protect the car's interior carpet from mud, dirt and basically anything else.\n\n* I purchased a screen protector for my display from [Spigen](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-Designed/dp/B084BNC3FG/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2L662REOLO0LC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=spigen+tesla+model+3+screen+protector&amp;qid=1623845582&amp;sprefix=spigen+tesla%2Caps%2C147&amp;sr=8-2), and it's working pretty well so far. Installation was easy, and the matte anti-glare is largely unnoticeable but protects from smudging.\n\n* Having gotten many dings and scrapes on my previous car in public garages, I decided to purchase a paint repair kit in case it was needed. Frustratingly, in the very first week of ownership, I needed it. I'm not sure how it happened, but at some point my tire  kicked up a piece of debris with enough force that the edge of my rocker around the wheel well was bent-in to the extent that the paint split along a small section around the edge of the rocker where the side meets the wheel well. No matter the cause, the paint repair kit rather was relatively easy to use after watching a number of guides, with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FC0xCixhU0) being the best I could find. A good reason to install the guards as soon as you can, as it presumably would have prevented this damage.\n\n\n* I originally purchased [Silver RIMETRIX Orbitals](https://rimetrix.com/product/orbital-silver/) for my car because I wanted something a bit more flashy than the aero wheels. The plan was to buy them, then coat them with Duplicolor [Hyper Silver](https://www.duplicolor.com/product/hyper-silver-coating/) to give them a metallic finish that would reduce their plastics look. After owning the car for a few weeks, I actually found the Aeros to look just fine and cancelled my order. I may come back to the orbitals, but for now I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite dreaming of owning a Tesla for nearly a decade and following them very closely since the early Model S days, I started to get cold feet as delivery day approached and the Tesla vision announcement was made. I wound up taking delivery anyway, and I'm incredible happy that I did. The car handles exceptionally, is very intuitive to use, and most importantly, I just love looking at it and knowing its all mine. If you're in the same spot that I was, I hope this review gives you a bit more insight into a number of steps in this process, as well as some of the quirks and benefits of owning a Tesla in our area. If anyone has any additional comments or insights, please comment them below so that some wayward google searcher in need of advice can be informed three years from now!",

Currently drive a 2014 Lexus IS350 AWD.\nThanks.\n\nEDIT UPDATE :\n     Thanks to all who commented, gave me a lot of info to work with. It was an interesting day, but ultimately it was a comparison of two things. A car that is electric (Hyundai) or a computer that can be driven. \n   It took just a few hundred meters to get into regenerative braking, it was just so natural, even the indicator buttons didn't phase me. Love the dashcam functionality, and the ultimate overall simplicity of the Tesla.\n  I love the design of the Hyundai, although it is basically a repetition of one of our other vehicles (Acura RDX), but using it was a little less intuitive, sometimes clumsy. Not a fan of that UI whilst driving. Acceleration was adequate, but lagged on initial punch of the pedal. Felt like a car that they'd tried to turn into an electric car, rather than designed from the ground up. \n I returned home, put my Lexus on the market. Gonna buy a Tesla.\nThanks again everyone for your help!\n\nUPDATE #2. Sold Lexus in one hour. Ordered Tesla 3 LR AWD. delivery in next few days!",

      "text": "[https://i.imgur.com/haFKNhQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/haFKNhQ.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1gc2jhl8c351.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdac288a88f0528b24c033364bfa0b4770060ea\n\n[Additional images](https://imgur.com/a/dYYFjdU)\n\nSubwoofer Specs: JL Audio MicroSub+ ACP112LG-TW1 12\" Slot Ported Subwoofer Enclosure with integrated amplifier providing 400 W @ 0.25 ©\n\n**Why did you upgrade?**\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 premium audio system is very good. It\u0019s a 15 speaker system with subwoofer. I previously owned a 2018 Model 3 and it was \u001cgood enough\u001d to where I never considered upgrading it. But the 2020 Model 3s replaced a large \u001cvent\u001d on the rear deck with a sealed metal rear deck and the bass response from the 6.5\u001d OEM subwoofer was sadly impacted from this change. This small change (along with pandemic boredom) were enough for me to decide I \u001cneed\u001d this. Also, mutually exclusive of the rear deck vent, the OEM subwoofer can\u0019t produce anything below 40Hz. It still sounds great but if you know your music well, there are many songs that are missing many sounds and you easily notice it.\n\n**How to install a subwoofer in a Model 3**\n\nFirst off... a huge thank you to Travis Llado who wrote an [incredibly thorough write up](https://www.travisllado.com/2019/05/tesla-model-3-stereo-part-9-summary-and.html) on the Tesla Model 3 audio and electrical system. I won\u0019t go too much into detail on installation details because his write-up is amazing and contains everything you need to know. But in summary, I tapped into the 12V power source underneath the rear seat bench and also tapped into the subwoofer speaker outputs from the OEM amplifier which provide the high-level inputs and remote turn-on signal for the JL subwoofer. I didn\u0019t install the solid-state relay or 100W/1© resistor as Travis and I think/hope the JL Audio\u0019s efficient Class D power load should be ok. If I encounter any issues I\u0019ll add those pieces.\n\n**Why the JL Audio Microsub?**\n\nI purchased the [JL Audio 12\u001d MicroSub+](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/acp112lg-tw1-car-audio-microsub-amplified-subwoofer-systems-93333) from Craigslist. I thought it was the smaller PowerWedge+ sealed box but it turned out to be the larger ported MicroSub+... but luckily that still fit perfectly into my car\u0019s lower \u001csub trunk\u001d (with slight alteration to the formed carpet as it\u0019s designed inefficiently with about 2\u001d of gap on all sides as the sub trunk pocket tapers inward as it goes down. The 10\u001d version of the MicroSub+ or the 12\u001d sealed PowerWedge+ would easily fit without modification. I don\u0019t have skills to build my own box and my buddy who normally builds custom fiberglass enclosures for me is currently too busy to help me at this time. I\u0019ve had JL Audio before in previous vehicles and know/trust the brand. Because of this, I didn\u0019t really look into any other brands for a subwoofer enclosure. In JL Audio I trust!\n\n**How much did it cost?**\n\nI found a great local Craigslist deal on the JL MicroSub+ at $350 cash. I did have to get a replacement [cable connector](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/acp-acs-pp-ca-rp-car-audio-microsub-amplified-subwoofer-systems-48031) and a new subwoofer [speaker grill](https://www.jlaudio.com/products/sgr-12tw1-car-audio-subwoofer-grilles-492177) since his was rather beaten up when I picked up the box. The cable connectors are great because with simple quick disconnects, the whole unit comes out of the car for times when I need the storage space. So for $395, I was able to acquire a \u001clike brand new\u001d sub that normally costs $630!\n\n**How does the JL MicroSub+ sound?**\n\nBoy is it loud! At first, being excited about having a big powerful subwoofer, I had the gain set to about 50% and the crossover set to 80Hz. That was way too high and now it\u0019s the gain is set to 20% and sounds much more balanced and musical.\n\nThe subwoofer hits quite low and hits hard. Bass heavy/forward music like Dr. Dre, Two Feet (check [Two Feet](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3dt6lj?si=_wF23BssRfmaK8Ww2WYbcg) out, so good), Elohim and Michael Jackson are quite impressive and sounds as they should, if not too much bass if anything.\n\nMore critical listening tracks like Jennifer Warnes\u0019 \u001cBird On A Wire\u001d still sound great and the subwoofer doesn\u0019t overpower or get in the way of the music at all. It\u0019s almost surprising since the \u001cbass heavy\u001d music is incredibly bass-y.\n\nNormal music that I listen to... The Cure, New Order, Rush and Echo and the Bunnymen sound just as they should. Clean mid bass which the Tesla already did well but much stronger kick drums and fuller sound.\n\nI may add JL\u0019s remote bass control knob after listening to it \u001cas is\u001d for the next couple of weeks but for now I think I can go without it as I\u0019m very happy with how it\u0019s sounding over the last 2 days.\n\nI also had planned to swap out the front 7\u001d woofers, 4\u001d midrange and tweeters to Focal components but I think I\u0019m super satisfied with just the subwoofer upgrade and will consider this chapter done. But this ain\u0019t my first rodeo so who knows, LOL.\n\nAlso, thank you to everyone on this sub-Reddit for answering questions I had over the past few weeks as I have been deciding which path to take.",

      "title": "Hello and Goodbye to my Brand New Model 3 SR+",
      "text": "**TL;DR** \n\nMy Model 3 became undrivable at just under 48 hours of ownership and 409 miles. Roadside towed it 3.5 hours away to the closest service center. Service center reconnected high voltage wires and replaced 12v battery. Replaced Windshield that was also defective. Service won't deliver it back to me in OKC. Car now works. Tesla CS not great. Keeping Car. Much Wow. \n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a whirlwind of a not even 48 hours since taking delivery of my brand new 2020 Model 3 SR+. I've experienced all the emotions from pure excitement/bliss to anger/frustration over the course of these 48 hours.\n\nI drove up from OKC to Kansas City on Saturday to take delivery. I figured it'd be a great experience getting used to the car, testing out the supercharging network, etc.\n\nThe journey begins with driving the vehicle off the lot. Immediately after getting onto the road, I noticed what I can only explain as a distortion in the front windshield. I chalked it up to my sunglasses having a smudge or just needing to get acclimated to the giant front windshield and the curve of it. About an hour into my trip home however, as i'm readjusting my position in the car to get more comfortable, I notice that this distortion is really only occurring right at the driver eye level. Figured as soon as I got home i'd schedule a mobile service appointment to get the glass taken care of.\n\nAt about the 150 mile in, the real fun began. I was pulling off of the highway to the supercharger in emporia, where the vehicle flashed a message 'Vehicle may not restart, Service is required message'. It stayed on the screen for about 30 seconds, then disappeared.. not to be seen again for the rest of the trip home.\n\nSunday was fine, only annoyed by the glass. Drove it around locally for maybe 20 miles with no issue and no messages on the dash.\n\nToday (Monday) rolled around and the ominous 'Vehicle May not Restart. Service Required' message appeared again. This time not going away, I decided to park and call Tesla Roadside to troubleshoot. Since the vehicle technically was still drivable, I went through the 'non-emergency' phone tree while parked and sat on hold. About 15 minutes into hold, the vehicle made a loud 'clunk', shut off and a new message appeared stating 'Electrical System power reduced. Vehicle may shut down unexpectedly' .\n\nAt this point the car was no longer drivable. Would not power up. I called Roadside back on the 'emergency line' and immediately after looking at the error they dispatched a tow truck to bring it to the Dallas service center 3.5 hours away.\n\nSo within 48 hours and only 409 miles on the car i'm already saying goodbye to my new model 3.\n\nIf i'm being honest, i'm pretty bummed. I've lived vicariously through you all for years! I realize this isn't a typical experience, but regardless it's not been a great one so far.\n\nI'll keep you guys posted along the journey to repair or return. I've also reached out to my Delivery Support Specialist, but haven't heard back yet (to be fair it's only been about an hour since my call). Ultimately I know I have options, including the drastic measure of returning the vehicle since we're well within the 7 day and 1,000 mile window.\n\nInterested in hearing your thoughts/opinions/suggestions or if anyone else has shared a similar experience so early into ownership.\n\nBe well.\n\n\\------\n\n# UPDATE 8/11 (AM)\n\nTesla Roadside dispatched a tow truck from Dallas. The truck arrived four hours after my call to roadside.\n\nI was able to connect with my delivery support specialist and he was super understanding. Mentioned escalating the issue to the delivery team in Kansas City at around 1pm yesterday, but I haven\u0019t yet heard from them.\n\nShortly after the truck was in-route back to Dallas I received an automated text from Tesla Service:\n\n&gt;Hello! This is Tesla Service. Loaner vehicles are subject to availability at check-in. If unavailable, Uber credits will be provided upon request. Any other alternate transportation would be at owner's expense.\n\nI understand this is an automated message, but it\u0019s slightly confusing/unaccommodating, given the situation. Soo did I just check-in to my appointment? Do I have to drive to Dallas to get a loaner? The process seems a bit fragmented for someone not close to a service center. I\u0019m not reading too much into this message at this point since I haven\u0019t talked to a human at Dallas Service or Kansas City Delivery.\n\nReceived a text from the tow company at 9pm that the vehicle had been dropped off at Tesla service.\n\nAt 11:30pm I received an automated email saying that parts had been ordered for my vehicle.\n\nASY,12V BATT AND VENT PLUG,M3 Part #: 1129182-00-B\n\nI\u0019m curious if this part order was automatically generated because the battery died (I can no longer connect to vehicle via tesla app). Or if a tech was genuinely looking at the vehicle at 11:30pm\n\nThe email also stated an appointment was scheduled for 11:56pm CT (yes pm). (I doubt that\u0019s a real scheduled appointment time.. but we\u0019ll see)\n\n# UPDATE 8/11 (PM)\n\nDiagnosis will not be completed until tomorrow (8/12) . At that point there should be some sort of ETA on repair. The Delivery Team in KC helped coordinate with Dallas service on a rental vehicle from a local rental car agency in the meantime. I also inquired about an exchange of the vehicle (still a little ahead of myself here, not knowing what the issue is but also wanted to see what my options were) and this was the response:\n\n&gt;If you do wish to proceed with returning your Model 3 we can have our Dallas team process that. Refunds typically take 14-30 days and we unfortunately won\u0019t be able to \u001cswap\u001d another Model 3 with yours(and you\u0019ll unfortunately have to wait 12 months before ordering the same Model 3 trim).\n\nI understand the reason for the rule (discourage abuse of policy as 'rental' vehicle, asking for a swap for minor cosmetic issues, etc, but it also seems odd in a scenario such as this to essentially ban a real customer who just wants a car of the same trim level that drives...\n\n# UPDATE 8/12 (AM)\n\nI haven't received any formal updates from Tesla yet this morning, but I can now connect to the vehicle via the mobile app (was not able to do that once the vehicle died).\n\nTelsa also provided me with a rental vehicle here in OKC in lieu of Uber Credits, which I picked up this AM.\n\n# UPDATE 8/13 (PM)\n\nWas contacted by the Plano, TX Service center to let me know they found the root cause of the issue. A connector in the high-voltage loop was not securely fastened from the factory. They reattached/secured it as well as checked all other connections at the front of the vehicle. \n\nBecause the high voltage loop shut off for safety, it sounds like the 12v also died at some point in transport and they also replaced that.\n\nAside from that, they did a diagnostic on the windshield and confirmed a manufacturing defect... and did a full replacement.\n\nMy Model 3 is now ready for pickup.. yes pickup.. Unfortunately I wrongly assumed they'd be delivering it back to me here in OKC. Kinda crazy i'll have to drive 7 hours RT, to pick up the vehicle. I guess my expectations were maybe a little too high :) .\n\nIn the end I have decided to keep the Model 3 given the issues are relatively minor, and seem to have been corrected. If issues continue to be persistent, I know there is still recourse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some photos for your viewing pleasure:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iv1w5ju45eg51.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12323f6543dff4a32befc40ede352df41281f0d4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jia3yrt45eg51.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f4f7b0080bffbabb8558226ca10b941740b17a\n\n[Away she goes :\\(](https://preview.redd.it/ryb3c9ow5eg51.jpg?width=827&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82a4c23457d004e30ee982cf9f8ee9b9ef947c2)",

      "text": "Don't forget if you installed a charging setup in 2020, you can get a 30% credit on your 2020 Federal tax return.  This includes anything from a NEMA 14-50 outlet install to a full Wall Connector install for Tesla owners.  If you purchase a second mobile connector for use with a NEMA 14-50 outlet, this will count too.\n\nOriginally the extension of the tax credit went through Dec 31 2020, but now it has been updated to end on Dec 31 2021.  So if you still haven't installed charging yet, you have all of this year to do it and then file on your 2021 federal taxes.    As you can see here, you can still apply for installations as early as 2017.  So if you have put in electrical vehicle charging in 2017 through 2019, you can do so.  However, you need to file an amended tax return to claim your charging credit.  This includes hardware and installation costs. Make sure you keep copies of all your receipts in case you need them for proof.   Remember to contact a tax professional if you have any further questions about this tax credit and how it applies to your situation.

      "text": " Our Model 3 a year ago and its hard to find reviews for these cars in areas that get cold. Really cold. -40 cold. So I figured I would write a review. And discuss our costs vs the ICE vehicle we previously owned.\n\nWe picked up a new, 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range on December 31 and have just passed 53000km. So far it has been outstanding, performing incredibly well. We\u0019ve added PPF to the entire front, tinted windows in the rear, Rally Armor flaps, Mountain Pass Performance skid plate and winter wheels with Michelin X-Ice Snow winter tires. We keep the hub caps on the standard wheels in the summer to increase efficiency.\n\nWe live about 35km out of town, going to town at least twice a day during the week for daycare. We also do a 900km round trip quite often. We had 2 front facing car seats when we bought it, but now one kid is in a booster.\n\nOur previous vehicle was a 2010 Lexus RX350 that was paid off. Fuel costs were getting too high so we decided to take the plunge to an electric. We used money we got from the sale of the vehicle as a down payment on the new one. I\u0019m 6ft tall with relatively long legs. I am more comfortable in the Model 3 than I was in the RX350.\n\nOriginally was expecting to buy a Chevrolet Bolt EUV, but with the recalls we couldn\u0019t buy one. We then decided that AWD was a requirement considering where we live and my wife strongly prefers it. Alternatives we considered were the VW ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mach-E. The wait for the Hyundai and VW were likely minimum 2 years and the local Ford dealer is not the best combined with prices that we thought were too high. Ground clearance wasn\u0019t a huge factor as we have a truck that I drive if it snows too much. And the Tesla Supercharging network is infinitely better than anything else in the prairies right now.\n\nThe car is parked in a heated (5C) garage year round. I installed a NEMA 14-50 outlet and charge at a max of 18 amps. We could charge at up to 32 amps, but it doesn't need to be that fast. We just use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle and a 14-50 adaptor. It\u0019s always plugged in and the battery is set to a maximum charge of 80%. In the winter, we schedule our departure time using the app. \n\nOur lifetime average is 207 Wh/km. Power at home costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering, especially considering the climate here.\n\nNow the main reason why we bought the car, to save money. We obviously drive a lot, way more than normal which made the math simple to justify. Our total public charging costs for the year are $1137. Our home power usage increased by about 9700 kWh, or $1455. We also used some free chargers. That gives us a total power cost of $2592. In our previous vehicle we averaged 13L/100km of premium fuel. At a conservative estimate of $1.75/L fuel price for the year, that works out to a total fuel cost of $12,057. (13L\\*$1.75 = $22.75/100km. 53000/100 = 530. 530\\*22.75 = $12,057). Our previous vehicle would have very conservatively required $1000 in maintenance to give us an annual cost of $13,057. Our total maintenance cost for our EV for the year was $150 for a brake service and cabin air filters. In our 1 year with an EV, we have saved at least $10,315 in driving cost. (($12,057 + $1000) - ($2592+$150) = $10,315). Including the price of our car payment, we have still saved over $2700 this year. And it actually is even more than that, if you were to properly factor in paying for gas (100% depreciation) vs paying for the car (much less than 100% depreciation).\n\nThe one concern everyone seems to have is the heat. It been great except when below -35C (-31F) on the highway. Sometimes at that temperature it\u0019s great, but other times it\u0019s just ok. It is always plenty good enough, even at those temperatures. In my experience, it is just as good below -35C as other vehicles I have had (Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra, Lexus RX350, Dodge Ram, to name a few) and better than others, like our previous Honda Civic. The BEST part about the heat, is that it is instant. You don't have to wait for the engine to warm up before it starts throwing heat. You turn it on with the app and in 5 minutes at -35C, the interior is toasty warm. Its incredible.\n\nIn summary, we have saved over $2700 this year by purchasing a new EV. We are extremely happy about the purchase! Because we drive so much, its absolutely made sense to purchase it. I still love driving it and highly recommend it to everyone. When we get solar in the spring, our operating costs will be even less. Excited for that!",

      "text": "My family just completed a 2300-mile week-long trip in a 2021 M3 LR and I hope this report helps someone who is in the market for a Tesla.\n\nTLDR: No regrets, but a Model Y may be better for long trips. Superchargers are what makes a Tesla the only rational choice for an electric vehicle purchase.\n\nWe began in the Portland Oregon area and headed down to Los Angeles California, visited with family, saw some sights, then headed home.\n\nThe South bound trip was split over 2 days with a stop on the Bay Area. The return leg was a massive one day, 17.5 hour drive.\n\nWe are a family of 4. Two adults and 2 early teens.\n\nFirst off, let me get the only true negative out of the way. The back seats in the M3 are not made for the long haul. The inability to make any adjustment leads to a lack of comfort, which makes people grumpy. This is not a fault of Tesla, rather just the fact that the M3 is a sedan. I do think that the seats generally are not as comfortable as other manufactures, but it could be my body type. I have not spent any appreciable time in a Model Y, but I imagine their ability to recline makes a big difference.\n\nPositives.\n\n* The car is smooth as butter. It is not a fatiguing car to drive.\n* Dual motors and instant torque never gets old and can extricate you from a jam that would otherwise cause stress in most ICE cars.\n* Auto Pilot is very cool and reduces fatigue. Unless you're doing 80mph at night, and it sees a piece of fabric in the road and emergency brakes. Then it's pretty stressful.\n* Room for cargo is not an issue at all. Suitcases, duffles, back packs, other crap. Still had room.\n* Superchargers are great. We all agreed that having to stop every 2 - 2.5 hours was nice. We like that we weren't confined to a gas station, and usually had better options to walk around and get food.\n\nLess positives.\n\n* There feels like too little room for the stuff that piles up on a long trip. Too small cup holders. Charging cables inconvenient for front seats. Door nooks don't hold much. My sunglasses never found a happy home.\n* Superchargers. Sometimes it felt like I was hunting for them. They were on occasion in split locations. Examples are hidden in the back of hotels, or 4 in one obvious location and 12 not obviously around a corner. We only had to wait a few minutes once, but I can see how it would be a problem hitting a bank of 8 chargers that are full and there's a line of folks waiting.\n* The battery icon on the main screen is horribly inaccurate and should be set to % or ignored completely. The energy graph is the place to look.\n* The overall impression of the superchargers is that I'm arriving at a transition in time, like when Blockbuster started getting DVD's but most people had VHS. Five years from now will be a completely different vibe.\n* Again with the superchargers... on one occasion we had to go way out of our way in Los Angeles to get a charge. It was just the location we were in, but it was the one time when it felt like a pain in the rear.\n* Lastly with the superchargers... This is where Tesla wins. I can NOT imagine trying to do that trip without their network. And I can see how opening up the network to non Tesla vehicles may cause significant backups without significant build out of the network.\n\nIn the end, it was really cool to take the car on that long of a trip. I had 1000 free miles from a referral, so the total charging cost was about $65. (I picked up a full charge at the hotel we stayed at on 2 of the days). BUT ... should we take the family on a long road trip again, we're taking our Toyota Highlander ONLY because the back seats are more comfortable. If it's 1 or 2 people or a short trip sub 500 miles...  Tesla all day long.",

      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, Cross County Road Trip](https://preview.redd.it/cc17lf72s4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54de4217b0f8e029626039f40026f1ca01f94483)\n\nAfter completing a [cross-country road trip](https://startupsidekick.com/roadtrip/) in my two-year old Tesla Model 3, I fell in love with it all over again and knew I had to write a post about it.\n\nIn my opinion, Tesla hasn\u0019t just revolutionized the electrical vehicle (EV) industry, it has reinvented the car, as I will show you in this (highly biased) post. \n\nWhether you\u0019re in the market for a Tesla, are an existing owner or are simply curious about EVs, I hope you\u0019ll get some value from this post.\n\nYou\u0019ll see why comparing a Tesla to most cars today is like comparing a smartphone to a flip phone \u0014 it\u0019s really that big of a difference.\n\nIf you don\u0019t know much about how EVs work, I highly recommend watching this popular 10-minute YouTube video titled [How does an Electric Car work?](https://youtu.be/3SAxXUIre28) \u0014 it\u0019s a bit technical but overall worth a one-time watch to understand why EVs are the future. It\u0019s no surprise the [EV market is expected to reach over $800 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/08/2045017/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-Market-to-Reach-802-81-Billion-Globally-by-2027-Allied-Market-Research.html)! \n\nIn this post, we\u0019ll take a tour of the following aspects of a Tesla Model 3:\n\n1. App\n2. Exterior\n3. Interior\n4. Driving\n5. Charging\n6. Safety\n7. Maintenance\n8. Community\n9. Cost\n10. Improvements\n\nHere we go.\n\n# 1. App\n\nBefore describing the car itself, I want to begin with one of the most convenient aspects of owning a Tesla: the [Tesla mobile app](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app). This serves as your primary car key and provides many remote control features.\n\nThe mobile app automatically unlocks and locks the Tesla 3 doors using bluetooth \u0014 this short-distance, keyless access is extremely convenient because it\u0019s hands-free (e.g. phone in pocket) and eliminates having to carry a physical car key.\n\nTesla does provide key FOBs but in the two years of owning my car, I\u0019ve only used them for valet parking or as a backup in my wallet, in case my phone dies. \n\n[Tesla Mobile App](https://preview.redd.it/58dwvga5s4y51.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317f6d10451adbbec6f8ac44fc17f8503bd414ea)\n\nThe Tesla mobile app complements the interior touchscreen by giving you many controls outside the car. \n\nThe long list of remote control features include lock/unlock doors/trunks, turning on the climate, control charging, valet mode, honk/flash to locate the car, set speed limit&and more.\n\nYou can even use the Summon feature to slowly drive the car in reverse or forward \u0014 think remote control toy cars \u0014 this can come in handy for water puddles or tight garages.\n\nOther neat features include the ability to send an address to your car from maps apps such as Apple and Google Maps (via the share option). You can even locate where your car is parked using the app.\n\nThese types of pragmatic, modern day tech features is what sets Tesla apart from all other car manufacturers.\n\n# 2. Exterior \n\nThe Tesla 3 is a sleek looking four door sedan, which drives like an expensive sports car.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 - Exterior, Frunk and Trunk](https://preview.redd.it/8h0tg7bgs4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad56e9c4135dacc45288284f8571e66a35542b68)\n\nThe doors have unique flush handles that are aerodynamically designed to reduce drag. You\u0019ll have to get used to giving one time instructions to first time users, such as \u001cput the thumb on the fat part of the handle and open with the rest of your hand.\u001c\n\nTesla 3 comes with two trunks, a conventional rear trunk and an innovative, front trunk (\u001cfrunk\u001d). \n\nI find the frunk extremely useful for small bags (e.g. groceries), since the incline keeps the bags from sliding around. I used to get strange looks when I opened the frunk but people seem to be getting used to it, thanks to a growing number of Teslas on the road.\n\nThe rear trunk also has lots of room with an additional compartment under the trunk\u0019s floor. You can also fold the rear seats down for longer objects (e.g. skis); I was able to fit a hybrid bicycle in there once.\n\n# 3. Interior\n\nWhen people get inside a Tesla 3 for the first time, they are often taken aback by how bare the interior is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1zpvo0ms4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62a611c636906e381a3503b728a84b3ba2554d8\n\nThen&they slowly begin to get wowed by how many features are packed in the deceptively minimalistic interior.\n\nThe Tesla 3 can comfortably seat five people, with heating in all seats. It has more legroom than conventional, internal combustion engine (gasoline) cars, since there\u0019s no transmission hump in EVs.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Minimalist Interior](https://preview.redd.it/gw6p397ns4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb614abeeedb58905b4a9d34322f45f1778cb575)\n\nWith the rear seats folded down, there\u0019s enough space to fit a twin size airbed \u0014 I have read about people sleeping overnight in their Teslas, at campgrounds.\n\nThe Tesla 3 has your basics: seats, air vents, several cup holders, multiple storage compartments, USB and 12v chargers, door locks, and window controls (auto retract for all four windows). \n\nAt the center of the front panel is a single, gorgeous 15-inch, extremely responsive, touchscreen to operate everything else (including the glovebox) \u0014 essentially your control center.\n\n[Touchscreen](https://preview.redd.it/c6hscs2ss4y51.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc20ae579abe5f6d2bcb67f47198dddc00937dbd)\n\nGetting used to having everything on a single screen takes only minutes to get comfortable with, since most of us use mobile devices these days, so it\u0019s a familiar feel.\n\nI\u0019ve personally fallen in love with the single touchscreen concept, since it feels like using a tablet (e.g. iPad) and gives the car a more airy feel, without the clutter of knobs you find in most cars.\n\nIt\u0019s baffling to me that other car manufacturers haven\u0019t realized the simple fact that consumers love their smartphones, since most cars still have a fragmented instrumentation dashboard.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto support helps but it still doesn\u0019t provide an integrated, smartphone-like, user experience (Ux) \u0014 imagine if you had part knobs and part touchscreen to operate your smartphone! \n\n[Settings](https://preview.redd.it/ghibu2dts4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a94d6a6ceb2bd2ac3716e8ff4adb93b3f7d2631)\n\nThe 15-inch touchscreen provides you access to many features, almost too many to cover in detail in this post, so I\u0019ll list them instead:\n\n* Speedometer\n* Door lock/unlock\n* Settings (glovebox, lights, locks, display, driving, Full Self-Driving (FSD)/Autopilot, navigation, safety, service, software, etc.)\n* Climate control\n* Wiper control\n* Backup camera\n* Navigation: Everything you can expect from a mapping app, with comprehensive supercharger network support built in. The satellite view is amazingly responsive!\n* Battery level, settings and consumption\n* USB connectivity/charging and 12V charging\n* Objects nearby (cars, trucks, motorcycles, signs, people, traffic lights, lane markings)\n* Dashcam \u0013 record video footage on a USB drive using Tesla\u0019s external cameras (see video at the end of this post)\n* Custom driver profiles\n* Manual/automatic garage opener via HomeLink\n* Sentry alarm system\n* Tire pressure\n* Incoming phone calls\n* Seat belt warnings\n\n[Netflix - Full Screen](https://preview.redd.it/eiu8fykus4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43a21c4af2ba34cef64474975bd53fe442135ee0)\n\nThen&there\u0019s a whole section on the screen dedicated to apps, including: \n\n* Web browser\n* Calendar (integrated with your phone with auto navigation) \n* Entertainment (with full-screen support) including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Caraoke (with a \u001cC\u001d), Atari arcade games, drawing tool, fullscreen campfire, and more.\n\nWith so many entertainment options, you will have to find reasons to get bored on supercharger stops. \n\nThe Tesla air vents provide ample control via the touchscreen, with some very cool graphics to change the airflow direction, by \u001cpinching\u001d the air animation.\n\n[Climate Control](https://preview.redd.it/0fyaaubws4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9255b483b56f58f2e92e833d541d71d54481f2ab)\n\nThe steering wheel comes with scrolling wheels that serve multiple purposes, for example controlling the music volume/track, cruise speed, side mirrors, steering column tilt, and soft/hard rebooting the car. It also has a built in sensor to detect whether your hands are on the steering wheel during FSD (see below).\n\n[Steering Wheel Controls](https://preview.redd.it/93vo5v5ys4y51.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a77fd63f0388336f43961e6250ce6d83f01f6099)\n\nOf course, you get all of the above&.under a wondrous, panoramic, tinted glass roof that inspires you to daydream in the daytime and stargaze at night.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Glass Roof](https://preview.redd.it/kiytvua1t4y51.png?width=4160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97c0db691401679f5e24d9552d46aa5e19cd092)\n\n# 4. Driving\n\nThe Model 3 is extremely quiet, fun to drive, nimble on turns, and accelerates fast enough to make people\u0019s heartthrob and say \u001cwow!\u001d \n\nImagine having the acceleration of an expensive sports car with the feel of a golf cart \u0014 that\u0019s what driving a Tesla feels like.\n\nAs of November 2020, here were the 0 to 60 MPH speeds for the three Tesla 3 models (with the ability to go faster via a paid upgrade):\n\n* Standard Range Plus: 5.3s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 140 MPH\n* Long Range AWD (my car): 4.2s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 145 MPH\n* Performance: 3.1s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 162 MPH\n\nTo begin driving a Tesla 3, you turn it on by putting your foot on the brake pedal and turn it off by putting the car in park \u0014 there\u0019s no \u001ccranking\u001d the car on or shifting the gear in park and pressing a STOP button \u0014 it\u0019s essentially like turning your smartphone on and off. \n\nSometimes at a complete stop in my garage or parking spot, I\u0019ll forget to put my car in park before opening the door \u0014 but no worries, the car automatically puts it in park for you.\n\nTesla also automatically engages the emergency brakes, when you park your car. It\u0019s these little conveniences that Tesla has thought of, which make the Tesla so much fun to own.\n\nWhile parking/reversing (e.g. in a tight garage), it helps to see a readout of exact measurement, and audio/visual warnings, for objects close by.\n\n[Tesla Nearby Objects Warning and Backup Camera](https://preview.redd.it/6ozx7sc4t4y51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8807f4fb65da59769779bcacdceb91b78172691b)\n\nWhen you first use the accelerator pedal on a Tesla 3, it feels like you\u0019re pressing against pure air since it\u0019s so quiet but the highly responsive, induction motor makes it a lot of fun to go from 0 to 60 MPH (4.4s in my car)!\n\nI absolutely love how quiet my Tesla drives. EVs in general are very quiet under 30 MPH, in fact so quiet that many countries will soon require sound emitters in EVs, for pedestrian and bicyclist safety. \n\nThough the Tesla 3 is a sedan, the large battery in the center gives it the weight and low center of gravity, making it more nimble than many sports cars I\u0019ve owned before.\n\n[Tesla Model 3 Battery](https://preview.redd.it/mzsrvau7t4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ce892b463b8bbc84419c0bcf6e48828c6ec937)\n\n**Single Pedal Driving**\n\nOne of the coolest features of the Tesla is \u001csingle pedal driving\u001d using a technology called Regenerative Braking (Regen for short; [see Wikipedia for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake)). \n\nWhen you let go of the accelerator, Regen enables your car to slow down rapidly while also charging your battery. My brake usage has reduced by 80% compared to conventional cars.  For example, you can have the car slow down quickly for turns or gradually come to a complete halt at stop signs, without having to use the brakes. \n\nTesla provides an automatic brake HOLD function that enables your car to stay at a complete stop, without you having to keep your foot on the brake (e.g. at a red light). This HOLD feature also automatically engages, when the car slows down to 0 MPH.\n\nThe HOLD function complements regenerative braking, since you can let go of the accelerator while approaching a red light and have the car come to a complete stop, without having to use the brake pedal (i.e. single pedal driving).\n\n**FSD/Autopilot**\n\nIf you\u0019ve seen the 2004 movie \u001cI, Robot\u001d starring Will Smith (as Detective Del Spooner), there\u0019s a scene after he crashes a car, when his lieutenant yells this at him: \u001cWhat is the matter with you? Traffic Ops tells me you\u0019re driving your car **manually**.\u001d\n\nWe are as close to fully autonomous cars, as we've ever been in our lifetime.\n\nThere are [five levels to autonomous vehicles](https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/):\n\n1. Driver Assistance\n2. Partial Automation\n3. Conditional Automation\n4. High Automation\n5. Full Automation\n\nTesla currently has Level 2 in its cars but has already demonstrated Level 3, in this [popular two-minute YouTube video by Tesla](https://youtu.be/tlThdr3O5Qo).\n\nHowever, even just Level 2 FSD is one of the coolest features in the car, since it significantly reduces the driver fatigue. \n\n[FSD - Highway \\(Utah\\), Night \\(Tahoe\\) and Golden Gate Bridge \\(San Francisco\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fy654bhat4y51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7e6e4692eb4e40f2f5af483f80200bc83a1172)\n\nFSD is a suite of features including Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, and others (e.g. Autopark, Traffic and Stop Sign Control).\n\nFSD literally saves you so much driving that, at times, you feel like you\u0019re babysitting the car, by just leaving one hand on the steering wheel with your feet lounging.\n\nI tell friends driving with FSD feels like playing a video game in a comfortable lounge chair, where you have to pay enough attention to not die but you\u0019re enjoying every minute of it. \n\nI use FSD anywhere and everywhere there are visible lane markings, from 25 MPH street to 80 MPH highway, speed zones.\n\nThis technology keeps getting better with every software update \u0014 I\u0019ve literally seen how it handles so much better over the past year, around things like construction areas.\n\nYou can engage just Autopilot (Traffic-Aware Cruise Control) by pressing the cruise control lever fully down once. To engage the full FSD, you press the lever down twice \u0014 this activates Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, and Auto Lane Change.\n\nLet\u0019s take a closer look at how FSD works.\n\n[According to Tesla\u0019s website](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot), \u001cEight surround cameras provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.\u001d\n\n[FSD - Cameras, Auto Lane Change](https://preview.redd.it/s28sotkgt4y51.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e20f98c616f548049083bedb176d0f050a669145)\n\nThe Auto Lane Change feature is amazing and I absolutely love using it each time! You change lanes by simply giving the turn signal and let your car do the rest; i.e. the car will automatically change lanes, when it\u0019s safe. \n\nWhile doing my cross-country road trip, I came up with two supplemental terms to *Auto Lane Change:*\n\n* *Delayed Auto Lane Change:* When you know you can\u0019t change lanes due to traffic, you can go ahead and \u001cqueue\u001d your lane change request and the Model 3 will change lanes, when safe. \n* *Accelerated Auto Lane Change*: When you don\u0019t want to wait, so you speed up to create a safe distance between the cars, which triggers Tesla to change lanes.\n\nFSD requires you to have your hands on the steering wheel every 20-30 seconds \u0014 I rest my left or right hand on the bottom part of the steering wheel to avoid getting the warnings but I\u0019ve heard of people using their legs, water bottles and other crazy ways to fool Tesla\u0019s FSD into thinking your hands are on the wheel.\n\nI\u0019m a bit embarrassed to be boastful about this but I\u0019ve come to rely so much on FSD that depending on surrounding traffic, I\u0019ll work on my mobile device momentarily (e.g. editing documents, instant messages, quick web browsing). I feel irresponsible and guilty but part of me thinks, this is how we\u0019ll gradually move to FSD&a couple of seconds at a time.\n\nWhile I absolutely LOVE FSD and use it for 80% of my driving (highway, local), I can\u0019t see a door-to-door FSD till 2022 or later, due to factors including Tesla\u0019s technology, roads (e.g. lane marketings) and legislation.\n\nTesla\u0019s FSD technology is already phenomenal and getting better rapidly but it has quirks that still gives me (and my family) a scare every now and then \u0014 enough for me to pay attention to the road.\n\nYou can learn more about Tesla\u0019s FSD technology here: [tesla.com/autopilotAI](https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI).\n\n# 5. Charging\n\nOne of the things people worry about with fully electric cars is running out of charge \u0014 after two years of ownership and a cross-country road trip, I can assure you, this has rarely been a problem for me.\n\nMany of my friends can\u0019t believe I still charge on 120v, after 2 years of owning my car! I realize it\u0019s extremely inefficient but we were considering moving and I just haven\u0019t felt the need for it since I work from home. \n\n120v (Level 1) charges at a pathetic 5 MPH but you can get 50+ miles overnight. 240v (Level 2) chargers charge between 10-50 MPH and direct current faster chargers (Level 3) such as the Tesla\u0019s superchargers, can charge from a couple hundred to 1,000 MPH (using the new [V3 Supercharging](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Supercharger Network and Three Levels of Charging \\(source: pluglesspower.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bctg6tlxg5z51.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42a961e8989be5b20b3540caa7b2902cf85496e)\n\n[According to Tesla\u0019s website](https://www.tesla.com/supercharger), as of November 2020, there were 2,000+ Supercharger stations (20,000+ Supercharger outlets) worldwide, with many more coming soon.\n\nOf course, you can always use 3rd party chargers or use the charging cable and adapter that comes with the Tesla. [According to Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416750/number-of-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-outlets-united-states/), there were over 24,000 charging stations (with over 78,000 outlets) in the US, as of September 2020.\n\n# 6. Safety\n\nTesla cars have the honor of receiving some of the highest safety ratings possible, thanks to their driver/passenger protection (e.g. airbags, rollover, alerts).\n\nFor example, here\u0019s a graphic from Tesla\u0019s website, showing all 5-star ratings for a Tesla Model 3, from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\n[Tesla\u0019s NHTSA Rating and Model 3 Airbags](https://preview.redd.it/krygv2tkt4y51.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f82fc7cab13dc3bdfe994f0b8c42f0652c22a0b)\n\nFrom close by objects in your garage to objects on the highway, Tesla 3 has you covered with alerts. \n\nWhile driving, Tesla constantly detects surrounding objects and displays them on the touchscreen (e.g. car, trucks, motorcycles, people, stop lights, lane markings). Any endangering aspects will show up in red (e.g. lane changes, passing cars).\n\n# 7. Maintenance\n\nEVs in general require much less maintenance than internal combustion automobiles. Tesla maintenance comes mostly in the form of software.\n\nTesla updates the software in the car automatically, every month or so. If you\u0019re new to a Tesla, it takes a little getting used to receiving software updates, similar to your smartphone or computer. Till this day, I find it fascinating that Tesla cars are just as much software (or more), as they are hardware.\n\n[Tesla Software Updates and Mobile Service](https://preview.redd.it/6l7bmwtmt4y51.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6072ac5bcf13cb1bf02df394abf47d1768d4f0da)\n\nTesla is also known to roll out some significant improvements via software updates \u0014 something you would expect to take your car in for (e.g. an acceleration boost from 4.4 to 3.9 seconds).\n\nMuch of any hardware maintenance can be done via Tesla\u0019s mobile service, where someone comes out to wherever you want. For example, I just had my two-year service done for $192.05, in my driveway (see [Tesla\u0019s Car Maintenance page](https://www.tesla.com/support/car-maintenance) for details) with the following note in the electronic invoice:\n\n&gt;*\u001cChecked Brake Fluid Brake Fluid at 80% life. Replaced Pair of Wiper Blades. Replaced Cabin Filter. Maintenance Performed Tire Rotation on Passengers side only, Drivers side tires are good where they are right now. Recommend new pass front tire soon.\u001d*\n\nAll other major services can be handled at one of Tesla\u0019s [Service Centers](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States), by scheduling via the mobile app. \n\nIn my area, they tend to be booked 2 to 4 weeks out but the service otherwise is courteous and efficient, handled using a combination of SMS texts, in person and email communications and generous Uber/Lyft credits to get around.\n\nOne thing I\u0019ve found to be a pain is when you have a flat tire \u0014 the 183 tires used on a Tesla 3 can be expensive and hard to find, since they have acoustic foam inside them. This was the #1 concern on my mind, while traveling on my cross-country road trip.\n\n# 8. Community\n\nUnsurprisingly, Tesla has a huge fan base including online social networks, offline clubs, third party apps, and much more. The following are some popular clubs and third-party apps that I\u0019ve come across and/or use regularly.\n\n**Clubs**\n\n1. Reddit: [r/Teslamotors](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/), [r/TeslaModel3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/), [r/TeslaLounge](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/), [r/TeslaCam](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaCam/)\n2. Forums: [Official Tesla Forums](https://forums.tesla.com/), [Tesla Owners Online](https://teslaownersonline.com/), [Tesla Motors Club](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/forums/model-3.137/), [SpeakEV Tesla Model 3](https://www.speakev.com/forums/tesla-model-3/)\n3. News: [Teslarati.com](https://www.teslarati.com/), [Electrek](https://electrek.co/guides/tesla/), [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/tag/tesla/)\n\n**Apps**\n\nBefore my cross-country road trip, I decided to hook up my Tesla account to three northworthy third-party apps that many online EV/Tesla enthusiasts seemed to be recommending:\n\n1. [Teslafi](https://www.teslafi.com/index.php?search=2020-08-14): Logs data for all your drives with amazing detail (e.g. graphs, battery consumption, maps, charging stops).\n2. [A Better Route Planner (ABRP)](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=99b25e8f-60a4-4cb4-90fa-f42b107793f3): Popular app used for more precise planning based on your EVs model.\n3. [Stats](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stats-for-tesla-model-s-x-3/id1191100729): Provides several bells &amp; whistles for Apple mobile devices (iPhone/iPad/Watch); e.g. schedule climate/charging, open doors/trunks via Siri, monitor battery health, and more.\n\nIt was a bit nerve-wracking to give my username and password to these apps but once you have an authentication key from one of them, you can use that for the others.\n\nAdvanced users with coding skills can use the [unofficial Tesla JSON API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) to obtain an authentication key or use [Teslamate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate), a self-hosted data logger with dashboards for driving, charging, efficiency, drain, stats, and much more.\n\nOnce you\u0019re setup with these apps, the amazing data they provide makes the whole process worthwhile, as you can see from some of the screenshots below.\n\n[Third Party Tesla Apps](https://preview.redd.it/mxntxwzot4y51.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9909b7db37d5f70871ba149df19ba75ccee11c)\n\n**Aftermarket**\n\nThere are plenty of aftermarket products for Tesla available on various websites. I\u0019ve only purchased two aftermarket products: a Qi wireless phone charger and a spare tire kit by Modern Spare.\n\n# 9. Cost\n\nAs of November 2020, here were the list prices for the three versions of a Tesla Model 3, in the US:\n\n1. Standard Range Plus: $37,990 (range 263 miles)\n2. Long Range: $46,990 (353 miles)\n3. Performance: $54,990 (315 miles)\n\nFSD costs an extra $10,000.\n\nIf you\u0019re considering buying any kind of EV, you can calculate the cost per mile by dividing its list price by its maximum range. For example, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range at a list price of $46,990 and range of 353 miles costs $133/mile, as shown in the below infographic from [visualcapitalist.com](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind when comparing prices is that Tesla is years ahead of its competition with its innovative technology and supercharger network \u0014 something that\u0019s hard to put an exact value on.\n\n[Cost of EV Ownership \\(source: visualcapitalist.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/iaofinrrt4y51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0999812bc4d6201d3c4033bda45e68f26314fb7)\n\n# 10. Improvements\n\nI\u0019ve owned some nice cars in my lifetime but never have I owned a car that I loved driving so much every single day, as much as I have my Tesla Model 3.\n\nTesla is as close to perfect as a car gets but it can use some tweaks, so here\u0019s a list of flaws and/or wishes:\n\n1. **Alerts:** The on screen blind spot warnings aren\u0019t good enough; most people have come to expect something built into the side mirrors. \n2. **Wipers:** Tesla\u0019s automatic wipers were horrible but since [Tesla launched its \u0018Deep Rain\u0019 neural network](https://electrek.co/2019/10/14/tesla-deep-rain-neural-net-automatic-wipers/), they have improved over the past year but still remain slightly flaky (e.g. turning on a couple of times when it\u0019s not raining).\n3. **Voice:** Support for voice commands is weak and nowhere as robust as Apple Siri or Google Assistant, which can be frustrating since I often have to turn to my iPhone (e.g. calling a local restaurant).\n4. **Lights:** It would be nice to have shortcuts to turn the head/park lights on/off, instead of going into Settings.\n5. **Map:** Tesla\u0019s map is absolutely amazing but it\u0019s missing waypoints, so you end up having to use something like the ABRP app (discussed above). Also, It would be great to see icons for what\u0019s nearby (e.g. restaurants, service stations), similar to supercharger icons. \n6. **FSD:** Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is overcautious, e.g. it\u0019ll keep 3 to 6 cars worth of distance versus the 1 car, I have it set at. Also, given the choice between tracking using the left and right lanes, FSD chooses to hug the right side, which is extremely annoying on highways (e.g. merging from on-ramps). Approaching stopped traffic at a red light on a major road can be nerve-wracking since the car waits too long to begin gracefully slowing down, thereby requiring harsher/faster braking later. The merging on and off ramp with construction barrels, needs improvement.\n7. **Battery:** The remaining battery life isn\u0019t 100% accurate to rely on entirely, since it doesn\u0019t take into account leakage, winter weather, winds, etc. It can be nerve-wracking when you think you have 20%, just to find it\u0019s dropped to 15% (and dropping).\n8. **Apps:** While it was great to be able to hook up third party apps, it would be nice if Tesla officially sanctioned them via some sort of an online marketplace and support for API keys. It would also be cool to add more 3rd party apps support; e.g. Waze, Amazon Prime, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto). Lastly, it takes too long to load the existing apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube).\n9. **Music:**  The music icon should be indicative of the map feature or the music and maps screens need to be separated. The music portion of the screen allows resizing but blocks the directions, in larger view. The music screen should provide more granular controls for track and display the time for songs (e.g. time left/played). There\u0019s no way to pause/mute the radio on the screen (you have to use the wheel on the steering wheel). Lastly, the Spotify interface is flaky (e.g. long load times, checkmark is confusing).\n10. **Tires:** I realize many cars nowadays do not include spare tires but it would be nice if Tesla provided third party options on your website, similar to how Apple/Google have marketplaces with reviews, for third party products (e.g. Spare Tire Kit by Modern Spare). Of course, Tesla does offer [roadside assistance service](https://www.tesla.com/roadside-assistance).\n11. **Superchargers:** It would be nice to have a tall, physical Tesla sign at supercharging stops, since it can be hard to find charging stations in places like shopping centers. A nice trick is to zoom in the destination using the satellite view of the map.\n12. **Service:** It can take from a couple to a few weeks to get a service appointment. I suspect some of the backlog is due to the [issues earlier models had](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/). I had one major and a couple of minor issues early on (steering wheel replacement, door hinges), which were covered under factory warranty and addressed quickly by Tesla.\n13. **Miscellaneous:** Having to reboot occasionally and/or rare black screen. Inside door opening controls can be confusing for first timers, since they look like window controls. Better/adjustable seat headrest that don't stick out so much. Rear windshield wipers to avoid water build up.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs detailed as this review is, I haven\u0019t covered many features, for example Navigate on Autopilot, Autopark, Lane Assist, chime on green traffic light, automatic high beam, driver profiles, and so much more.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla continuously delivers features, so it\u0019s not feasible to list everything here. For example, the beta version of the completely rewritten FSD [began rolling out in October 2020](https://electrek.co/2020/10/20/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-rollout-elon-musk-slow-cautious/). For more information on software updates and other great resources, visit [tesla.com/support](https://www.tesla.com/support).\n\nIn my opinion, Tesla is years ahead of anything comparable on the market currently, thanks to their technology, customer data, supercharger network, battery life, customer service, and more.\n\nTesla has reinvented the car and thought of so many conveniences (e.g. single pedal driving, auto unlock/lock doors, low maintenance), that it makes it a pleasure to drive and own this car, every single day. Even long distance driving feels more like an enjoyable journey rather than a chore. \n\nIf you\u0019re considering buying a Tesla 3, do it. Imagine driving the car of the future, today!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thanks for reading! :)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*If you still want more...please see the* [*original post*](https://startupsidekick.com/the-definitive-tesla-model-3-review-own-the-future-today/) *for video reviews, more photos and...a* [*work anywhere journey on this road trip*](https://startupsidekick.com/roadtrip/)*.*",

      "text": "Hey Y'all.  Over 4th of July took a 9 day long trip from LA to Wyoming. This was my first over 400 mile trip so wanted to share some data points for those interested. Round trip was 2700 miles averaging 239wh/mi traveling from CA &gt; Nevada &gt; AZ &gt; Utah &gt; Idaho &gt; Wyoming and back\n\nPlanning: Checked Ventusky for wind directions for any tail winds or head winds, ABRP and Tesla Supercharger map to see if any major elevation gains and charging gaps (especially in Eastern Idaho and Wyoming). My previous car was a Chevy Bolt so I was pretty familiar with driving long distances on pure electric using EA/Chargepoint etc.\n\nCar: We packed a lot due to car camping for a couple of days and tent camping while in Tetons. 2 people slept seats folded down with 3\" mattress topper (we are both under 5'10'') while moving our bags/container boxes to the driver/passenger seats no issues and v comfy.  \n\nActual Trip: The drive itself I used the Tesla Nav and realized how conservative the Nav was for % battery left even when driving 5-10mph over the speed limit (when it was safe to do so). ABRP was a better projection to the actual driving.\n\nTypical traffic leaving LA on a Friday evening but as soon as we got into the Mojave Desert we did not encounter any traffic until we returned back to LA the next week LOL! Autopilot was huge for those long straight stretches of road in I-15 allowing us to relax our arms/shoulders and eyes.  \n\nCharging: Each stop we went we targeted 15% SOC which we beat with no range anxiety at any point. Southern to Mid Utah along I-15 before Salt Lake City needs to step up their charging speeds as the 72kw stations (often times charging at 50ishkw) takes too long even for a bathroom break considering that speed limits are 80mph. Jackson Hole Wyoming has a charger at the Whole Foods parking lot which was huge as it allowed us to have enough battery while at the Tetons driving around.  \n\nTakeaways: The battery efficiency of the M3LR is insane.  Any long driving of 250wh/mi or under is great to me. Even driving 75-85mph we were still averaging ~239wh/mi (4.15mi/kwh) which is insane to me due to the speed we were driving, all the added weight from our gear and elevation gains. Coming from a Bolt, I'd be lucky to average 260wh/mi on a long drive. \n\nFun note: At the campgrounds and parking lots at Tetons, numerous people were amazed M3 made it on the trip and asked questions about charging and general electric vehicle questions which I was so happy to discuss.  Many people were from Texas and drove trucks and were legit considering an electric car soon but their biggest concerns was charging infrastructure which is a valid criticism.",

      "text": "2021 Standard Range+\n\nI recently transitioned from owning a 2018 Honda Civic hatchback to acquiring this stunning Tesla last Monday from the pre-owned inventory. With fewer than 25,000 miles on the odometer, it's truly surreal to realize I now possess my dream car, especially considering it used to be just a wallpaper image.\n\nSince embracing a fully electric vehicle (EV) lifestyle, I've observed a few key points. Living in an apartment complex without EV chargers means I rely entirely on superchargers and the ChargePoint network. Fortunately, I'm only 10 minutes away from a supercharger, and my gym provides access to a ChargePoint station. Regrettably, charging at my workplace isn't an option.\n\nWhile charging has become a regular part of my routine, it hasn't been a significant inconvenience. I'm either at the gym or within a short distance of a charging station.\n\nInitially, grappling with range anxiety was a genuine concern. Transitioning from tracking miles to monitoring battery percentage helped alleviate some of that anxiety. I've also learned about phantom draining, the impact of sentry mode on battery life, the role of air conditioning, particularly during high-speed highway driving, and the benefits of regenerative braking. Additionally, I've come to appreciate the widespread availability of superchargers in most cities and popular destinations.\n\nLastly, a piece of advice: Don't worry if your battery level drops a bit after a quick trip. Remember, you bought the car to enjoy it, not to constantly worry about it.\n\nI welcome any suggestions or recommendations for modifications from the members of this community.

Last year my wife and I decided that we were going to go electric. A bit of background first:\n\nWe\u0019re in Australia and live in a regional centre in New South Wales. Now, there are probably around five model 3\u0019s in the town in which we live (population \\~ 65,000 as of writing), so it was a pretty big deal to us. To put it bluntly, we feel slightly like guinea pigs.\n\nI have had a lot of questions from my family, friends and work colleagues, most of which are along the lines of \u001cWhat happens when it runs out of charge?\u001d (My answer is usually something along the lines of \u001cWhat happens when you run out of petrol?\u001d). I thought I\u0019d sum up a few bits and pieces here for my fellow regional New South Welshmen in case, like me, you are trawling this subreddit in excitement but have a few concerns. I\u0019ll try and skip over the usual hype around acceleration, storage, panel gaps etc.\n\n1.Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries are brilliant. Although we\u0019re just barely in the first chapter of our EV experience, from what I understand (based on the heinous amount of posts on this subreddit regarding LFP batteries), LFP batteries don\u0019t do so well in the cold.\n\nWhere I live:\n\nMean max temp - 31.9 °C (89.42 °F)\n\nMean min temp - 2.8 °C (37.22 °F)\n\nI mean, it\u0019s only been a short while, and we\u0019re in the midst of a warm-ish summer, but so far so good. I plug it in when I get home from work most days and don\u0019t worry about the 80% max charge issue/idiosyncrasy of the previous batteries. One less thing to worry about.\n\n2. Insurance. We upgraded from a 2018 Holden Colorado (diesel ute/pickup) and we\u0019re saving $20 a month on insurance. We\u0019re with NRMA and have full comprehensive. This puzzled me, so when I was on the phone transferring over the insurance from our ICE vehicle to the EV I asked why. The helpful gentleman on the other end of the phone said something along the lines of Tesla being one of the safest car companies, yadayadayada. I wasn\u0019t going to argue. We\u0019re paying $70AUD a month (at agreed value).\n\n3. Maintenance. A lot has been said about this, so I will keep it relevant to regional Aus. Tesla informed me that if I needed assistance with the vehicle for any reason, they\u0019ll send someone from a metropolitan area (or a licensed someone from a regional area) to come and take a gander. Now, I don\u0019t know what this means in a real world scenario (and hopefully I don\u0019t have to find out), but it sounded legitimate enough. The website states: \u001cRoadside Assistance is available 24/7/365 during the first four years, or 80,000 kilometres for cars covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty (more on this in the next point).\u001d Roadside assist policy - [https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/roadside-assistance-policy-en.pdf](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/roadside-assistance-policy-en.pdf)\n\n4. Warranty. The Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty covers your vehicle for 4 years or 80,000 km, whichever comes first. The Model 3 SR+ (now the rear-wheel drive) also has 8 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of Battery capacity over the warranty period. \u001cTesla\u0019s belief that its electric vehicle is fundamentally more reliable than petrol engine vehicles,\u001d and that it is designed to provide owners \u001cpeace of mind\u001d by combining the guarantee with eight years of roadside assistance, which includes flat tyre support.\n\n5. Rebates. Although we\u0019re under a conservative liberal leadership at the moment, the rebates aren\u0019t HORRIBLE. No stamp duty (as a rebate, $2,250) and an EV rebate ($3,000). For that second bad boi of 3k, applications can be made until 25,000 rebates have been claimed so it\u0019s a limited time deal.\n\n6. Charging. Mainly in the wall at home using the included mobile charger (get about 17km per hour) which does us for most things. Will be getting a Gen3 wall charger from Tesla soon, so that\u0019ll be something. The NRMA chargers scattered around regional NSW ([https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/charging-network](https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/electric-vehicles/charging-network)) are currently free, but will cost $ if you\u0019re not a NRMA roadside assist member sometime in the future. We\u0019ve been on a few road trips and haven\u0019t run into any issues so far. Also, PlugShare. Just get it already.\n\nWe did the classic ceramic coat and tint just to make life easier with cleaning (touch free carwash, then a quick chamois after). We have a three-year-old so have a car/booster seat in the back and that\u0019s all dandy. Honestly, a great family car. A great family car for regional areas just as much as it would be for metropolitan areas. We\u0019re a one-car family and it\u0019s serving us well. Sure, we get a few stares, but who gives a shit.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or clarify things if needed.",

      "title": "The cost of charging a Tesla",
      "text": "As we all know, charging an electric vehicle is much cheaper than filling a gas vehicle. Especially Gas prices are creeping up again. Oil prices are up 30% since early July. But how much does it cost to charge an EV (I am only analyzing Tesla here)? In fact, it all depends on where you charge. If you choose the right place, you can actually save a lot of money over the course of a year.\n\n**Charging A Tesla At Home**\n\nUnless you have the benefit of free charging \u0014 some early Tesla owners are still eligible for complimentary Supercharger access \u0014 connecting your Tesla to your home charging station is likely the most cost-effective method. In North Dakota, you can charge a Tesla Model 3 RWD from completely empty to a full battery for just $7 at home, although this scenario represents the most economical case. North Dakota boasts the lowest average electricity cost in the country, at less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, and the base Model 3 has a smaller battery than all other Tesla models. In contrast, charging the larger battery of a Model S or Model X with the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. (at $0.34 per kilowatt-hour in Connecticut) would set you back nearly $40.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that comparing the cost of charging an EV with filling up a gasoline tank isn't a straightforward apples-to-apples comparison. To get a meaningful perspective, we must consider how far your budget can take you with each type of vehicle. As demonstrated in the table below, you can operate a Tesla for as little as a few cents per mile. For example, an individual covering the national average of 13,500 miles annually while consistently using their home charging station could incur expenses ranging from $405 to $1,755 for charging.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlp3d1lxwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8223570436f03f1411a2227bc912ee894c300739\n\nThe precise figures you encounter will naturally fluctuate, influenced by factors such as your local electricity rates and your vehicle's actual efficiency in real-world conditions, which can be impacted by variables like weather conditions and your driving habits.\n\nT**he Pricing for Utilizing a Tesla Supercharger**\n\nTesla's extensive network, boasting an impressive 17,000 Superchargers, offers the advantage of convenience, albeit with a price tag. A Supercharger can swiftly charge a Tesla from nearly empty to 80 percent capacity within a mere 15 to 30-minute timeframe. However, it's worth noting that the electricity cost at Superchargers is approximately twice as much as what you'd spend charging your vehicle at home. The pricing spectrum varies, spanning from $0.25 to $0.50 per kilowatt-hour, contingent upon your location.\n\nIf you want to check the price of each charging station, Lectric provides this service for free (an EV all-in-one app), it can help you find the most affordable stations near you. The difference between Lectric and the Tesla platform is that in addition to Supercharger, Lectric also supports price inquiries of other suppliers like EA, Evgo, etc. It also supports price comparison during route planning. You can choose the cheapest or shortest route according to your needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krabdumqwssb1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301d999bfa5a4a543803c6e92e429ce126ec8809\n\nWhile most EV drivers typically utilize these DC fast chargers for long-distance journeys, some Tesla owners rely on Superchargers as their primary charging stations, akin to conventional gas stations. The table provided below presents energy expenses based on prevailing Supercharger rates, with annual energy cost projections calculated under the assumption of covering 13,500 miles annually, relying exclusively on Supercharger charging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk4qdp4vwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c9fe328c1379e3f9b04bb273190deb14cc7ec0\n\nTesla occasionally entices new buyers with complimentary Supercharging, typically offered toward the end of the year or fiscal quarter to stimulate sales. In recent years, these incentives have been restricted to 1,000 miles or a one-year duration. However, there's a noteworthy exception for some Model S and Model X vehicles sold before January 15, 2017, which included a unique perk of free lifetime Supercharging. This benefit seamlessly transfers to each new owner whenever the vehicle changes hands. Consequently, these specific Teslas can be somewhat elusive in the market and often command a premium when they become available for sale. Their added value is typically most pronounced for individuals intending to rely solely on Superchargers, considering the economical nature of home charging.\n\nShould you express interest in a comprehensive comparison between the expenses of Charging a Tesla and Fueling a Gasoline Vehicle, I will provide a detailed update in forthcoming content.",

      "title": "New to Model 3 and Tesla - Love it",
      "text": "Hello all, so my family decided to get a base Model 3 a few weeks ago and we love it.  Thought I'd post overall!\n\nI'd finally convinced my wife we didn't need any new cars for approximately a year as I had a surgery recently I had to pay off (almost a year from now it will be).  So, I'm like let's wait.  Well, her Nissan Rogue had the infamous transmission problem starting to go and instead of wait longer, I was like let's dump it (the CVTs on almost all Nissan's now appear to be a 'when' it fails and not an 'if'.  Nissan/Renault can get bent and should have more lawsuits)\n\nSo, we did the usual let's look at a Toyota.  I still own my Prius C and an older base model workhorse Tacoma.  Well, I guess I'd forgotten how much Toyota prizes their cars.  They had 0 of their electric B4209x49a.  They had a couple used Hybird or plug-in Rav4's.  They wanted $43,000 to start on a USED base model Hybrid Rav4 that was a couple years old and high miles for being under a 2 year old vehicle.  We walked out before they could pull it around to test drive and laughed (literally did this, I don't care to play games anymore).\n\nWent to Ford and tried out the Mustang Mach E.  It's a great car, really, Ford hasn't done half bad.  I DO NOT understand the Mustang name or as a 'brand' now, but whatever.  The car is again totally fine, but absolutely uninspired and frankly boring (which if you're going to call it a Mustang, jeez...). The price is also a bit high.  The only thing I liked is I found a BRIGHT macaroni yellow one and it had a matching roof too (even though we went with Tesla and most Mustangs are glass roofs, this is absolutely not ideal in Phoenix.  A full glass roof is frankly cool, but horrific for 6 months).  I took a look at the F150 Lightning too as they had a grip - the BASE model ones they had they wanted to charge a 10% 'dealer premium' on.  I laughed again as this is asinine and I don't do a bait and switch - a $65,000 truck online suddenly became $72,000 because of a $7,000 dealer premium.  Their rationale was it's a premium truck like a Raptor or whatever an 'in demand'.  I drive by a few times a week, they have the same ones still there, in the same spot.  I guess it's not 'so in demand'.  \n\nWhich lead us to going back to a demo drive at Tesla decided between the Y and 3, and we landed on the 3 due to the awesome pricing and tax credit.  You get the same or more car than the Mach E or ANY Toyota and it's cheaper... before the tax credit.  It's also stupid easy to buy - there's a price, a few options (and these are real options, not bullshit packages like the dealers.  You want 7 seats in the Y, pay for that.  You want a tow hitch, pay for that.  None of this want the moon roof?  Well you also need to buy a premium sound package!)  Order the car on the weekend, picked up Tuesday afternoon and only was a day longer because her trade-in had a snafu on the mileage report we had to clear up with the government.  \n\nWe love the car.  It's fast.  We had my handyman put in a 14-50 plug in the garage (my lord are industrial plugs WAY more and paying for over 70' of 6 gauge romex wire EXPENSIVE).  It charges great.  We've already done a couple day trips that are longer and used superchargers too - it's all so seamless.  Really, Tesla has hit it out of the park.\n\nJust to wrap up - why are the other car makers so horrid still?  They are literally pushing away customers.  Granted, the Tesla was already high up on a list, but Toyota has lost me as a future customer forever.  Also, the Japanese makers seem absolutely petulant about making electric cars - hybirds were great in 2003 but time has marched on.  I can't see myself buying their vehicles as they currently are and Toyota and Honda both have a joke offering of any electrical cars in the near future.  Ford is ahead of most with at least 2 solid models, but they are stuck in the 1960s.  The dealership model has to die and Tesla will make that happen.  \n\nFinal weird thought/question - I know legally car companies have to charge the 'same destination' charge and it has to be a separate line item - but why does Tesla still play this game?  I don't know if legally the MUST charge it - fine, but then make it $1 for each car.  It was slightly annoying to have to add in the extra  $1300 or whatever when doing quick loan estimates.",

      "text": "A friend of mine has a retail business that, partly due to the pandemic, has a very high demand for deliveries.  So he asked me if I would like to help him out doing deliveries for the next few days (including today).  I have a few days off from my regular job, so I figured I could help him out and make a few bucks at the same time.  The other perk, which I realized today, was that I was getting paid to drive my car all day.  So a win-win all around.\n\nBut doing this today, I realized what a great delivery vehicle the Model 3 is (really, most any EV).  The deliveries are all in urban areas, lots of stop and go with very little highway driving.  So my efficiency was pretty good.   Also, I have done this type of driving before in ICE vehicles and never liked it.  Speed up, hit the brakes, stop for a traffic light, accelerate again, stop sign.  Just constantly back and forth between the gas and brake pedal.  With the Model 3 and Hold Mode on, I rarely took my foot off the accelerator.\n\nThen with an ICE vehicle, do you shut off the engine when you get out to make a delivery or keep the motor running?  Not even something you think about in an EV.\n\nAfter each stop, I then had to look at the next deliveries to decide which one to do next, which route to take, etc.  Again, no idling. \n\nThen, it was fairly warm today in the Northeast.  An ICE vehicle would have had a lot of heat coming off it, which would have made it even warmer getting in and out of the car.  I am sure my electric motors heated up somewhat, but nothing that I could feel getting in and out, or sitting with my windows open planning my route.\n\nFinally, I get to drive my car about 5-6 hours, listening to Spotify and podcasts.  I wonder if he needs someone full time?\n\nDefinitely looking forward to the next two days of deliveries.",

      "text": " Hey guys! So my dad was looking to buy an electric car given he already has a gas SUV(Rogue). He was interested in either of the two above and wanted me to do a bit of research before he bought one. Generally, I figured the Bolt was quite a bit cheaper, almost $15k less than a M3. But when I looked at my local Chevy dealerships, they mentioned some ongoing GM strike to justify a $4000 markup on the EUV LT. Now after some discussion, I was able to bring it down to $2k, leaving me at $30k MSRP, and add in registration and other fees, etc., it leaves me at around $33k out of the gate. The M3 on the other hand is at a discount than its usual MSRP, currently at only $37k ($4k less than MSRP) near my local dealership. Inclusive of all other fees and the discounts offered by the referral program would approximately leave me around $38k. Since I live in NJ, both the vehicles are exempt from state tax and also qualify for both the federal $7.5k tax credit as well as the $4k credit from the NJ state.\n\nSubtracting the tax credit from the respective MSRPs leaves me at around $21,500 for the bolt and $26,500 for the M3. One of the bolt's primary appeals was its cheaper price tag but given there is now only a $5k difference between both the cars, I'm in a dilemma over which to suggest to my dad. The M3 is the better car but it was never $15k-20k better than the Bolt EUV. But is it worth going the distance for only $5k more?",

      "title": "The Perfect Family Car",
      "text": "Today is one year to the day since picking up my Model 3.  My number one thought is - the perfect family car.\n\nWith two SUVs in the garage - I'll be honest - I bought the Model 3 for ME!  The first few weeks you would have thought I bought a 911.  Beat every car at every stop light, washed it every weekend, and cried the first time I scraped a wheel.\n\nBut as the weeks and months progressed new feelings emerged.  We (wife, 2 kids) started using the Model 3 for every trip (even long ones).  Here are my thoughts on why -\n\nSAFETY - When you feel your kids are safe you are much more at ease.  Your kids drive so many of your decisions but when I pulled the trigger on the Model 3 purchase I actually felt like I was robbing my kids.  Thinking about how much $50K+ could boost the college funds, I almost did not complete my order.  All the sensors and warnings add up to a more comfortable feeling on the road.  The warnings are accurate and there are very few false positives.  My daughter is adamant about auto-pilot when I reach for my phone.\n\nFUN - The Model 3 is just a joy to be in when traveling.  The glass roof and panoramic views definitely help but until you have a car full of 12-year old boys playing with \"emissions mode\" you have not lived a full life.\n\nENTERTAINMENT - Best User Interface on the road.  Zero learning curve and my wife and kids can alternate playing DJ.  Everyone gets to hear what they want and because there is a sense of control, the bickering and nonsense has almost completely gone away.\n\nGOLF CART - Many friends called the Model 3 a Golf Cart when we got it.  Upset me a little but I definitely don't hear that any more.  But I think about my brother who lives in a fancy golf-course community and they have a true golf cart in the garage.  They tell me how great it is to be able to use it to run to the pool or take the kids to a friends house.  With kids, there is a lot of running around.  With the Model 3, it just \"feels\" better only having to step in, press the accelerator, and run to the school, practice, store, sleep-over, friend's house and the hundreds of other short, barely-planned trips you make every month.\n\nCALENDAR - This has been one of the best adds.  It was automatic to use it for work as most of my appointments had an address.  Now when I know I will be picking up or dropping off the kids, I always add the address to my calendar.  Stress decreases one order of magnitude.  Leave meeting, click-click, arrive at the game or one of their new friend's house without 4 texts to the wife navigating a new subdivision.\n\nENVIRONMENT - Since we now own a car that doesn't use gas, the kids have naturally asked a lot of questions about emissions and the environment.  The discussions have been excellent and they show a maturity beyond their years on all the layers which we have an effect on the environment.  As a parent, it feels great to see your kids taking actual steps to reduce and re-use and not treat environmental problems as something \"they simply can't do anything about\".\n\nAnd yes, the kids love being dropped off in a Tesla.  We were the first Model 3 at the school and I now count 5 or 6 but they still always want me to take the Tesla.  \n\nSeriously looking at the Model Y for the next vehicle...",

Added in some visualizations. If the viz tab doesn't render a graph for you, try refreshing your browser cache (CTRL + F5 on most browsers).\n\n\nPlease note: **THIS IS A TEST ENVIRONMENT AND APPLICATION.** I hacked together this application just over 36 hours. I am pretty sure it is bug free for the moment... But then again, we'll just have to find out. Feel free to enter your information, whether you are waiting on your order still, or have already taken delivery.  \n\n\n1. Click \"Add My Order\" in the top navigation bar. This will bring you to a page where you can input your preliminary order details (even if you have already taken delivery). You MUST provide all information EXCEPT for the checkbox fields for \"VIN Received\" and \"Delivery Taken\" (as well as delivery date if you haven't already taken delivery).\n2. **Save your order hashcode which is displayed in blue text at the top of the page.** You'll use this code to come back to make updates. **There is no recovery mechanism for this code, so if you lose it you're boned.** This order hash is your (anonymous) identity. EDIT: I can theoretically retrieve this hash for you manually, but this isn\u0019t ideal. Will get around to implementing recovery steps eventually. \n3. If you receive a major update from Tesla (VIN or delivery date), use the \"Update My Order\" in the top navigation bar. You'll be prompted for the hash you received when you created the order. From this screen, you can also indicate if you've cancelled your Model 3 order, or if you no longer wish for your order information to be stored in the application database.\n\nThat's it! I didn't put any analysis or visualization stuff for now, and the data I'm capturing may not be totally comprehensive, but it's a start. Also worth noting that the application is deployed on a VERY small cloud server (I'm paying out of pocket and while I hope this might be cool for people to interact with, I'm not blowing hundreds per month quite yet). Let's see how long it takes the app to break.  \n\n\nIf and when people post their data, I will build pretty graphs and analysis tools and stuff, and of course address bugs along the way.  \n\n\nCheers.",

      "text": "Tldr: owning an tesla takes more effort.  But they are able to get you from a to b through z just like a gas car.\n\nI would say I'm an extreme case user in the tesla world where 5+ hour drives are common.   As in 1 to 10 times a month.   Oftentimes, my destination is in the middle of nowhere, as in the nearest name-brand hotel is 30+ miles away.  I do emergency work a lot so last minute travel is normal.   My travel is literally the anecdotal \"well what if I need to drive to blankity blank some ridiculous miles away, and i didn't charge last night?\".  I drive on gravel a lot, dirt roads.  Coal covered roads.  My car has seen many driving environments in 6 months.\n\n\nSince everyone likes to hate I'll start with the bad. \n\n1.  The 360 mile range is based on 30mph travel,  not highway speeds.  I see about 240 to 270 miles of actual highway range. So about 3 to 4 hours of driving based on apeed.\n\n2.  Charging the car for work trips means I lose about 20% of my time.  I can't bill that time.   It's just gone.   It takes me about 7.5 to 8 hours to do a 6.5 hour trip.  \n\n3. Earlier mornings has increased my coffee consumption per mile.  This is in conjunction with point 2.\n\n4.  The need for home charging to really make the ev world worth it for the masses.  I live near Chicago, so not having home charging has not been an issue.  But many places that will matter.\n\n5.  Repairs.  I got side swiped two months into owning the car.  None of my insurance preferred shops fixed teslas so i had to hunt. Quickest I could get in was 2 months.   Many shops were at 5+months lead time.  Time for repairs however was no different than my bosses car.   Everyone is waiting for parts. Had to get a new door.  All in all it took about 3 weeks.\n\n6.  People that will try to mess with you in traffic just because they hate teslas, or Elon musk, or want to prove something to themselves.   Always be mindful of loud exhaust pickup trucks.  I'm 100% serious 9/10 any dangerous moments the last 6 months has been a pickup truck.\n\nThe good:\n1.  The driving experience.  Driving my tesla is a dream.  First at a light?  Zoom zoom.  Last at a light?  Let the car handle driving and just relax.  The minimalist approach takes getting used to but it's fantastic. \n\n2.  One pedal driving is just... so freaking cool.  Once I got used to it... driving rentals is like going back in time. \n\n3.  No brained trips.  I just get in the car.   Put a destination in and bam I'm on my way.   It will route all my Charge stops.   Though knowing your route can make a huge difference,  they need to do a little better about not putting in 100% charge stops.  That's where you lose the most time. \n\n4.  I haven't had to hold in a pee since owning this car.  I can drink how much I want without worrying about \"causing an unnecessary stop\".  Seriously an underrated perk.  Everyone hates on Charging and range.   Enjoy peeing in your bottle. \n\n5.  Every charge stop has food and drinks and restrooms within a 5 minute walk.   I've had some work sites break room located further.  I will say though, driving late during a holiday your still stopping at a gas station to pee.\n\n6.  Ease of charging.   I hop out and plug in and do whatever I want.  I don't have to sign in,  swipe, anything.   It's super nice. \n \n8.  Driving is less stressful.   Seriously.   The autopilot is my Xanax to driving.  Bumper to bumper? Just hang out and monitor the car and let it do the work for you.   Highway?  I can plan out passing or letting someone by more efficiently.  I'm a very active driver so it frees up my mind to make sure I am not in the way or make sure someone else isn't going to be in my way. \n\n9.  The cameras.   I had 5 videos i sent to insurers showing me attempting to avoid the collision.   The guy jumping into my lane and the point of contact.   Live monitoring my car from the app.  Event based recordings for any suspicious activity by the car.   Hilarious videos of people going out for a smoke at 3am at the hotel. \n\n\n10.  The hate.   I love people that just wanna hate on my car.   It's juicy unnecessary drama that makes trolling fun\n\n11.  Free charging.   Oh boy nothing like a good free charge up after getting paid mileage.  \n\nAll in all I love my car.  Inconveniences of charging are offset by the sheer amount of perks.\n\nPS.\nRange anxiety took a long time to get over.   The first month I don't think I went below 50 to 60%.  5% charger destination estimations  still make me a little nervous.  10% destination isn't even a second thought.\n\nPSS\nAma, if you're looking to buy, or own a tesla and long range driving gives you pause, I'll be happy to walk you through what I do.",

      "title": "Thoughts on the Tesla v11 Software Update",
      "text": "I waited to get good hands-on time with the new update before writing down my thoughts on it. I didn\u0019t want to rush and make conclusions before giving it a proper try out. And I\u0019m glad I waited. I saw many posts that were written shortly after the update, and I feel like those users didn\u0019t give the update a fair shot. Some of my opinions have stayed the same, but others have changed after using v11 for the past couple of weeks. I will also try including possible explanations for the changes, although I would still disagree with them. For reference, I own both a Model 3 and a Model Y.\n\n* There are way too many things that were previously easily accessible that are now hidden behind menus and require extra presses. Apparently, this was done to limit distractions, but I\u0019d argue many of the changes make the car more unsafe and cause more distractions and eyes away from the road.\n   * As a family, the cars are shared between individuals. Previously, it was very easy to see who\u0019s driver profile the car was set to and change it with a couple of taps. Now, just to see the profile requires a tap, plus the two to change the profile.\n   * Hiding such a widely used feature such as heated seats behind a menu makes absolutely zero sense. It should be a tap away at all times. Not only that, there is no longer an indication that the heated seats are on. Obviously, you can just feel the heat, but sometimes you want to see what level the seats are set to and change them accordingly. This change was most likely made due to the addition of the heated seats also being controlled when the climate is set to auto mode. But I rarely have it set on auto as I prefer to change the settings to what suits me. A compromise to this would be adding indicator dots under the climate temperature, similar to Range Rover. In my previous car (a Range Rover Velar), the heated seat setting would be indicated by red dots under the temperature, allowing you to quickly see the setting and change it if desired. Now just to see the setting requires a tap. This is one of those changes that makes it seem as if the car was designed by/for people that have never lived in a cold environment.\n   * The windshield wipers speed setting is also hidden behind a menu. This one isn\u0019t that big of an issue to me, because any time I wanted to change the wipers speed, I would do a single tap on the wiper stalk for the menu to come up. This functionality still exists so I haven\u0019t had to change how I use it. But, I could also see this being another issue for drivers that were used to having the wiper button always present on the main screen.\n   * Another example of aiming to simplify the interface can be seen by hiding the defrost buttons behind the climate menu. Once again, a feature that required a single tap previously now requires two. This may not seem like such a huge deal, but when driving, every second your eyes stray from the road are precious. I would also argue that drivers that have been living with these cars for a while had all these buttons mapped into their muscle memory. We would be able to tap them without even looking at the screen, but that is no longer possible.\n   * A response to many of these changes could be \u001cjust use voice command.\u001d And I wish it was that easy but half the time, voice command doesn\u0019t understand what I\u0019m trying to say and the other half, it does the wrong thing. Another reason these changes seem to have been made is due to the current emphasis on FSD. But FSD is still a ways off and many people don't use or have access to the feature.\n* Changes that make the user experience worse:\n   * Heated seats can only be turned on while the climate is turned on. This one should be self-explanatory.\n   * Before, all the heated seats could be controlled from a single menu. Now the interior schematic of the seats only allows you to control the rear. A whole separate sub-menu for rear climate seems very unnecessary considering the only thing to control is fan on/off and the heated seats.\n   * The map when set to dark mode is very hard to read. This seems to be a bug because only certain people are having issues with this, but since this is the case for both of my cars and an update has gone by without this issue being resolved, I am including it here.\n   * Not being able to see if the dashcam is recording while driving. There have been instances where for whatever reason, the dashcam didn\u0019t start automatically recording. Once again, something that should be easily viewable as it was prior is now hidden behind a menu.\n   * Removal of the Trip and Odometer cards from the main screen. This can no longer be viewed while driving unless you want to cover up the whole map and limit all other functionality. People have also complained about the removal of the Tire Pressure card, but I don\u0019t think it\u0019s healthy to obsess over that. The car will let you know if you have low tire pressure.\n   * When changing the climate fan speed, you can no longer tap on either side to increase or decrease and can only change it by sliding or tapping in a general area. I miss having the buttons that I could tap, which in my opinion was a lot easier while driving. They are still present when changing the temperature or volume, so hopefully they can be re-added for fan speed as well.\n   * The progress bar when listening to podcasts/music/media is barely visible. It is hard to tell how much of the media has played, is left, and it\u0019s much tougher to scrub through.\n* Changes that I\u0019m neutral for:\n   * The blind spot camera seems like a very nice addition for a lot of people, but I am not a fan. It is distracting and I wish it would push up the road visualization UI so you would still be able to see the graphics of the other cars on the road behind you. Maybe this would be better implemented on a car such as the S/X that have gauge clusters.\n   * When I first saw the icons, I thought I would hate them. After using the software, I can see and understand why this change was made. It is a lot easier to deduce what I want to click now that they are different colors. I still prefer the style of the old icons and I hope they give us an option to revert back to them, but I don\u0019t hate the new ones as much as I thought I would.\n   * Rearranging the speed and drive mode doesn\u0019t seem to have any benefit, but there weren\u0019t any drawbacks either. I only wish they would move the speed limit under your driving speed so you don\u0019t have to change your line of sight multiple times when looking at that information.\n* Changes that are improvements:\n   * Being able to customize the icons you want in your dock is a huge win. I can put one of my most used features, the energy graph, just a tap away now. Being able to have quick access to what you use is a very nice feature. For example, if you use a particular music service, you can pin that to your dock now.\n   * Hiding the map options give the map a much cleaner and simpler look.\n   * Having all the car control consolidated under one menu makes using the UI a lot easier. Things aren\u0019t as scattered around as they used to be.\n   * Having the climate split for the passenger and driver makes it much more convenient for both.\n   * Removing the x button in favor of swiping down gives consistency across the UI. Previously, both behaviors were present. Also, the x button was small and tough to use while driving but the swipe down gesture is simple and intuitive. Also, it should be very familiar if you own an iPhone.\n\nOkay. So overall, what do I think of the update? I think it\u0019s a regression. A user shouldn\u0019t have to adapt to an update just for the sake of new as seems to be the case with v11. Now Elon did say they are working on UI improvements, but in its current state, there is a lot that seems to have gone in reverse. If they are going to let us customize the dock, let us customize all of it to our lacking. The UI should be able to adapt to the user. We should be able to add heated seats, defrost buttons, wiper controls, etc. I am hopeful the criticisms of many are taken into account so that the UI can be rectified and improved. At the end of the day, if no changes are made, we\u0019ll all end up getting used to it, but we\u0019ll still remember how good it once was.",

She's now interested, oh crap!  Was never in the market for an X but it looks like our need + range + previous Tesla experiences are all lining up.\n\n**TLDR:** Might be getting a $95k+ Model X out of nowhere, mostly because of the Raven efficiency boost and love of our current P3D+.",

      "title": "Apple Music on Tesla appears to use the HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps. Explanation and testing inside.",
      "text": "I got off my arse and did some very simple testing. It is my opinion that Apple is using the HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps when streaming Apple Music via the Tesla UI. My testing methodology and results are below.\n\n##Methodology\n\n* iPhone 14 mobile hotspot\n* [Hotspot Monitor Data Usage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotspot-monitor-data-usage/id1037580658) from the Apple app store, to monitor data traffic.\n* 2019 Model 3 on 2022.44.25.1 (we also have a 2021 Model Y on 2022.44.25.3 but I haven't seen an indication that bitrates were adjusted between these versions)\n\nFrom there, I would monitor the data usage of the car while streaming music. I would match the data usage per song up to Apple's claims to see which codec is likely being used. [Per the Apple Music settings, it says (for a three minute song):](https://imgur.com/a/gRt5Qib)\n\n* 1.5MB for HE-AAC (64k)\n* 6MBfor AAC (256k)\n* 36MB for Lossless (ALAC)\n* 145MB for Hi-Res Lossless (24-bit/192kHz)\n\n##Results\n\nThrough multiple songs I observed the same pattern - A burst of data as the next track began, then a trickle of data throughout the song. It appears to buffer most or even all of the song, then pause between tracks to do it again. On average, I saw ~2MB per track, with ~1.7MB during the initial burst and ~0.3MB throughout the track. This is consistent with the HE-AAC standard, as most of these songs were a little over 3 minutes in length.\n\nThis leads me to believe that Apple is using their HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps.\n\n##Possible Questions/Concerns\n\n(I'll update this with good questions from the comments)\n\n**Q: How can you be certain that Apple is using HE-AAC and not another codec?**  \n**A:** I can't be certain, but it's a reasonable guess. Apple uses very specific codecs for their 4 quality settings for Apple Music. Tesla's UI streams via Apple Music. It would be highly unlikely for Apple to make a codec unique to this one specific application given the size of their catalog. ~~That said, it's certainly possible that they have a hidden lower setting (32 kbps?) for embedded applications such as this.~~See the last question.\n\n**Q: Could they be using a higher bitrate over LTE?**  \n**A:** Not likely. There is no benefit to nerfing the bitrate over Wifi compared to LTE. There is benefit to nerfing it over LTE, as Tesla bulk buys data for their premium connectivity subscribers, and the incentive is to get as much out of it as possible while using as little as possible.\n\n**Q: Ok, but why does it sound so much better to me?**  \n**A:** 1) You're in a car, not an isolated and quiet listening environment. It's virtually impossible to tell the different between high quality lossy and lossless compression in such an environment. Secondly, [multiple listening tests (notes 10-13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Efficiency_Advanced_Audio_Coding#cite_note-10) have shown that users cannot tell the difference between HE-AAC at 64 kbps, and MP3 via a high quality encoder at 128 kbps, even in isolated environments. Both Apple and Tesla likely felt that this was \"good enough\" for automotive use, and Tesla has incentive to minimize data consumption for their premium connectivity.\n\n**Q: Would it be better for me to stream over Bluetooth? And if so, should I use high-quality (256 kbps AAC) or lossless?**  \n**A:** 1) Premium connectivity is a convenience that you pay for. Using Apple Music over BT will yield higher sound quality and, if that's the only reason you had premium connectivity, it will save you money. 2) If you use high-quality (AAC 256 kbps), it will play back using AAC over BT, so you should lose no additional quality going from phone to car. If you use lossless, there is debate if it would transcode to AAC or SBC. Best case, you're introducing a non-zero amount of additional battery drain for no benefit (AAC), worst-case is you get SBC and it sounds slightly worse. Use High Quality.\n\n**Q: Is it a Tesla, AT&amp;T, or Apple limitation that we can't have offline storage and higher bitrates?**  \n**A:** Of the three, my personal bet is on Apple limiting the choices, and Tesla choosing the lower of the two, but this is highly speculative. But I'll try to source it. Apple allows for the embedding of Apple Music via JavaScript. Tesla uses JavaScript for much of their UI and app interfaces. So it's a safe bet that Tesla is pulling from that. [Per this link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickitjs/musickit/playbackbitrate) (thanks u/smithre4), Apple Music's embedded application(s) only support streaming (no offline), with bitrates set to HIGH (256 kbps) or STANDARD (64 kbps).",

      "text": "Took delivery of my 2023 M3 on the 12th of December, I love the car and everything about it.

      "text": "**TL;DR**: Trying to collect a list of ***reliable shops*** near **Brea, CA** for **Tesla** Model 3 **wheel alignment**. I'm trying to find a good one that \"deserves\" my business.\n\n**Long Version**: Will someone share some reliable shops that they go to near Brea, CA for their Tesla wheel alignment? There are several similar posts asking for people's experiences, but I'd something more constructive and specific. I myself have had a difficult time finding a reliable shop. It's almost infuriating to think that consumers are at such disadvantage when it comes to having access to reliable auto mechanics. I am sharing my own experience if anyone's curious, but I hope this post can collect some reputable auto / tire shops that deserve Tesla (Model 3) owners' businesses and save fellow local owners sometime in their research.\n\nI'm in Brea, CA, far east LA County / far north Orange County. I always go to **Rene's Tires** *(La Puente)* for tire patches. It's $20 for a quick patch. Little to no wait, no pressure, no upsell of any sort. A real &amp; honest shop.\n\nInitially they seemed OK to do my alignment for $130 (when I patched a tire), but when I returned (after getting new tires from Costco on 6/7/2023, I needed new ones anyway), I was told that the tech was not there (6/10/2023 Sunday), so I had to do another trip. I called **Mountain View Tire** *(Rowland Heights)* right after, was quoted for about the same price, and then went in, but was told by who seemed to be the manager that they don't work on Teslas. \"You'd void your warranty if we worked on your alignment\", so I left. *Note: Not being a Tesla-certified shop is not the same as not having the experience or know-how.* \n\nWhen I called back on Monday (6/11/2023) again to confirm that the tech is there at Rene's Tire, I was told that they cannot do it because its' a Tesla.\n\nI checked with Tesla (6/10/2023) to see how much is the wheel alignment, and if they had such a policy. I was greeted with confusion and was provided an estimate of $240. which was then later raised to $270. Based on a combination of what I read online from multiple owners / technicians, I figured doing Tesla's wheel alignment are a little bit different, but not all that different. It all comes down to each shops experience, which comes down to luck. I don't think vehicle owner's should receive varying level of services based on luck, and therefore the reason that I'm here. \n\nCalled **American Tire Depot** *(Artesia)* (6/17/2023 Saturday) by accident, was quoted $160, (with a $25 Father's day discount would bring it down $135). went down to **American Tire Depot** *(Brea)* and was greeted by confusion (which is my bad) and was quoted $229, with a attempt to get my business by doubling the coupon and charging me $170. At the moment, I was not readily comfortable with the price difference because I'm expecting the same price across the different locations for the same brand, even though they're different locations. While the guy tried to explain that Tesla's take a bit more work, I needed some time to process. Called **American Tire Depot** (*Diamond Bar*) to get some clarification, was quoted $150, accepts $25 Father's day discount which would've brought it to $125. When I got there, I was told that if the camber is off, they wouldn't be able to adjust it because they don't know how. (Implying that only Tesla knows how)..This is when (I think) finding a reliable shop outside of Tesla became a personal mission for me.\n\nI looked more into this whole wheel alignment thing and also wanted to ask the Tesla community, but did not find ***it*** (this subject line) right away. I hope that others can share their experiences as well, and I also want this to be a helpful resource for others. I think my next car will also be a Tesla, but, really, *it's just an alignment!*\n\n**Firestone** *(Brea)* seem to be able to do it, and I'm scheduled for Saturday at 9:00am. After seeing [this thread](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/firestone-couldnt-do-wheel-alignment-on-tesla.218184/), I'm not 100% hopeful that they do it, but I'm guessing it'll be shop dependent, or even tech dependent. I was quoted $111.99 (1 yr warranty) and $189 something (lifetime). Online it's $111.99 for alignment with 1 year warranty and $209.99 for alignment with lifetime warranty. I also saw [this](https://vehicle.firestonecompleteautocare.com/tesla/3/2022/repair/alignment/) from Firestone online, so I guess Tesla is becoming more and more popular. If you've read it up to here, you may be catching my drift. I have trust issues, but I think I am really just a product of my environment.\n\nI called **Community Tire Brea** and was quoted about $125, confident that he can do it, but if parts are needed will need to order it (like a bolt for adjusting the camber or something).\n- https://www.communitytirebrea.com/Auto-Repair/Tesla-Tires-Rotations-Brakes-Alignments-Cabin-Filters\n\nI saw **Solesbee Auto Crafts** as a certified Tesla shop, (all the other ones seem to only focus on collision repair, this one at least mentions alignment), but they seem to work M-F 8am-5:30pm, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to use their service given my inflexible work situation.\n- https://www.yelp.com/biz/solesbee-auto-crafts-yorba-linda\n- called 6/19/2023 and confirmed that they **do *not*** do wheel alignments. The girl who picked up said they might do them when it's related to a collision repair, or they might just send it back to Tesla to do them...? I don't know what that means, but I guess for whatever, wheel alignment is not their business.\n\nSaw this youtube video that mentioned **[Chewerks](https://www.yelp.com/biz/chewerks-la-habra)**, but also found a few bad reviews.\n\nI'm actually happy to give them a try, but will probably do so after I try the Firestone shop first, then Chewerks, then Community Tire Brea. I'm glad  that there are some options, at least...\n\nI'll report back with some good news, hopefully sooner rather than later.\nEdit 1: added dates, updated that Solesbee don't do wheel alignments + ...\n\nJust asked a car friend, and was told that **Temple City Auto Repair** should do Tesla wheel alignments, no problem. \n- https://www.yelp.com/biz/temple-city-auto-repair-temple-city\n\nEdit 2: went to Firestone, they honored my appointment, gave me an estimate of 90 min wait, waited there while they worked on the car, saw a number of returning customers for routine work and wheel alignment, did not see another Tesla while there but am happy to report that I've gotten it done now. With a coupon I found online -$20, I now get free alignments from Firestone for as long as I own the vehicle for $189.99. I feel that Frank gave me a sense of reliability (he gives off the owner vibe, so maybe that's why), and I loved that there's a poster/banner that quotes Harvey S. Firestone, saying \"I believe fundamental honesty is the keystone of business.\" My doubt about whether or not they'll do a good job is mitigated by (1) the lifetime warranty, (2) that Brea really has a lot of Teslas so I'm blindly trusting that there are at least several other Tesla owners that do wheel alignments at Firestone, and (3) Firestone is a national brand, although I'm sure experiences will vary at different locations. \n\nBonus: Firestone has an app, and it allows online scheduling and keeping a record of service history. (Although it was not synced to the info at the store, I recorded it manually but I think it's still helpful.) Frank told me that he'd prefer phone call appointments since online scheduling does not consider actual shop availability (it'll always accept the appointment?  despite that I read somewhere that online scheduled appointment will always get 5% discount). I also asked him about brake servicing; however, Frank told me straight-up: the only things I can help you with is alignments &amp; tires. Again, I appreciate the honesty.\n\nI'm hopeful that **Community Tire Brea** and **Chewerks** *La Habra* would both be fine, but I really just wanted to share my experience and save others some precious time. Best of luck y'all!\n\nIt's kind of weird needing no service at all for 5 years since I got my Model 3 in 2018, so if anyone knows of good shops that will perform affordable maintenance services, please do share as well. (I did changed the cabin air filter myself and rotated tires as needed. For those who say Teslas don't need maintenance, I'm no expert but I watched the video from Rich Rebuilds that [some maintenance](https://youtu.be/9h3W-0iWYvc) would still be good to keep the car in good shape...)",

I have two quick questions:\n\n1). If the car is delivered in 2022 and Congress changes the tax law anytime in 2022 it should qualify for the new tax break, correct?  I mean, I guess it is possible that Congress could change the law and make it effective as of the date of that law, but that isn't likely, is it?  I don't want to wait forever, and I guess I could delay the order if Congress suddenly looks like they are taking action in January.\n\n2).  I like the red color, but I don't love spending an extra 2K for a paint job.  Are red resale values higher?  Any thoughts on white (which is my second favorite color) vs. red?  I live in Las Vegas, is white a cooler temp than red or is that not really true?  Why are red and white multi-coat, and does that make them much better?\n\nThanks for any help!",

      "text": "We have made several 2 hour trips since we got the M3 but this was the longest trip by far. We drove from central VA to New York City and back. We tackled both ways in one go. I have driven to New Hampshire well over 20 times in the last 30 years to visit family so I really noticed the difference on this trip. The biggest game changer was one pedal driving.\n\n\u000b\n\nMy wife usually works during a lot of the trip and when we were going thru Northern Virginia she immediately noticed how much smoother it was in stop and go traffic. Having done the trip multiple times in a manual I also LOVED how much better driving in heavy traffic using one pedal is. It really is a MASSIVE game changer. So much smoother, no moving your foot back and forth. I was so much more relaxed when we finished both trips. The other thing I really enjoyed was how much quieter it was. Spending over 8 hours in a car at a stretch really makes you appreciate how much more relaxed you are at the end after being in a much quieter environment.\n\n\u000b\n\nI also realized that the shortest range M3 still let us drive far enough each leg without us feeling inconvenienced. I am sure the stop and go traffic helped with range but on the way home using the Jersey Turnpike we still were ready to stop when we needed to charge. We both enjoyed the forced stops and would walk around stretching our legs after using the bathroom.\n\n\u000b\n\n664 mile round trip. We left the house at 100% on the way to NY. I don't remember the percentage we were at when we arrived in NY. We spent $50 total for the trip on Supercharging. I usually drive 9 over but there are times when I was pushing 85. I have removed the aero covers. The car sat for a week outside without Sentry or Cabin Overheat Protection on. Battery went from 87% to 84%. I checked on the car 4 or 5 times while were gone. I was very impressed with only 3% drain even with me checking it multiple times over a week.\n\n\u000b\n\nWe are making a trip to Maine late June and I am looking forward to seeing the difference taking my new 23' MYLR will make on the overall trip. I picked it up the middle of this month and I am really enjoying the room and the difference in performance. I hope this helps anyone that is wondering about trips in a M3 RWD.\n\nedited for spelling",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI drove from LA to Park City yesterday, about 13 hours with leisurely stops to charge and walk around. Autopilot was working like a dream for the first few hours of the trip until the first supercharge in Baker, CA. After that charge, I engaged AP once back on the freeway and the car/software seemed to not read the environment around it at all. \n\nIt would swerve for no reason and the driver visualization would jump between accurately depicting the scene around it to not understanding at all what cars were around it or what the lanes on either side were like. I should have taken a video to illustrate what happened but simply put, it would accurately show the car in front of it for a few seconds and then that car would disappear altogether or veer into another lane when in reality the car in front remained at a steady distance and in the same lane. Same goes for the cars on either side.\n\nI thought it could be due to strong sunlight shining directly into the front-facing cameras and did a bit of research online and read that a few others have had this experience so chocked it up to that and let it be. Fast-forward a few hours and a couple chargers later and the issue continues to persist.\n\nAt this point I think it could be due to dirt and dust blocking the cameras and sensors around the car so I make sure to wipe all those down at the next charging station. I get back on the freeway and the driver visualization is still inaccurate, and there seems to be a direct correlation between the two, so I don't even bother engaging AP because I don't want to put myself or anyone else at risk.\n\nTowards the end of the trip a thunderstorm rolled in and wiped the car clean of all the dead bugs, dust and dirt. I kept an eye on the driver visualization after that and it seemed accurate for the most part but I didn't want to chance it with other drivers on the road.\n\nWe arrived safely last night and I drove the car a bit around town this morning but haven't been back on the freeway to test whether or not it's working as it should be.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone else had a similar experience? There doesn't seem to be much literature available online about this issue and it would seem to me that Tesla shouldn't even allow you to engage AP if the cameras and sensors are bugging out so hard. I understand that it's all in beta, but it seems to me the software is advanced enough to know that cars around the Tesla don't just appear and disappear from one moment to the next.\n\nThe drive was still a pleasure but it goes without saying it would have been fantastic to allow AP to do its thing the majority of those 13 hours.\n\nIf anyone has any advise or can share similar experiences, that would be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "The M3 RWD keeps dropping in price while the Bolt EUV is hard to find and sells at MSRP or higher. What would you say is the deciding factor to go with one or the other? I already have a deposit (refundable) on the bolt and from what I've seen 2023 M3 RWD are plentiful at the moment since everyone wants a MY or M3LR.\n\nHere's the thing. M3 is getting a significant refresh for 2024. Bolt is being left behind for the ultium battery lineup. I would wait for 2024 when the federal tax credit is POS but in my particular situation there's a $4000 state incentive that's probably running out of funds by the end of this month November. Chevy offers a few other incentives as well noteably a free level 2 charger installation. Tesla has the referral thing.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Bolt, I wouldn't be surprised. I've personally never seen one on the road. The bolt premier has some higher end features even the M3LR lacks, but road tripping with slow DCFC charging speed is dreadful to think about. I'm also leaning towards M3 RWD because, theoretically, an LFP battery lasts 2 to 4 times longer than the older lithium-ion battery tech in the bolt. Of course Chevy's LFP tech Ultium is for next years EVs.\n\nI want to keep an EV as long as possible. My current ICE hatchback is nearing 20 years old and it's seen better days. The bolt would be fine as a main commuter (40 mile round trip/ 5 days a week) but for longevity, the M3 LFP battery may be a safer bet. If I got the M3 I could also without hesitation replace my ICE hatchback for the occasional interstate road trip. Yet the bolt is generally more practical, likely has better build quality, arguably better tech hardware, more passenger space, and slightly less expensive. Any thoughts? And no, I'm not getting both.",

      "text": "I was supposed to take the delivery of 2023 M3 SR today but I got a call yesterday stating that the car was damaged during transport. My understanding is that there's a dent and some scratches on the rear bump. The advisor was nice about it, apologetic, and they will look for a Tesla-certified body shop to fix these issues this week. None of this would show up in future reports since it's pre-delivery.\n\nHas this ever happened to anyone here? If so, what did you do or what did the advisor do (eg. additional discount?)?\n\nEdit: Update\n\nThanks for all these suggestions. I contacted the Tesla advisor asking for a VIN rematch. I guess the environment and inventory situation has changed.\n\nThe advisor provided 2 options:\n\n* Rematch and lose all the discounts (basically I'll be paying full price $42k or so\n* wait it out or as it term by Tesla, Hold.\n\nI got an discount of $3k so I have decided to wait it out. Since I'm waiting, the next question to the advisor is, would the fix restore the car to full factory condition (eg. replacement of parts, not just fixing the dent by popping it out and applying local paint). They confirmed that it'll be a full replacement (but they did try to pop it out as the first option but apparently it's quite obvious).\n\nLastly, there's no additional discount due to this problem. The advisor (not the original one contacting me for the repair) was quite adamant that it's not possible and the original advisor was wrong to even suggest that it's possible. The delay thus far has been 1.5 weeks and it'll likely be longer. The advisor did say that it won't be months (very reassuring /s).",

      "title": "First Year Ownership Experience and Review From The Perspective of a BMW Enthusiast",
      "text": "I have had my Model 3 for 1 year 10 months and 11 days. This post is long overdue. \n\nThough I am a relatively young driver at 26, the Model 3 is the most satisfying car I\u0019ve owned and one of my all-time favorites to have ever driven. That is not to say that the experience has been 100% positive. Moving from my 2015 3 Series to the Model 3 had little to no learning curve, but the refinement the Bimmer offered is noticeably absent. The following comparison best represents my experience coming to terms with the Model 3's features, personalities and quirks. \n\n**Exterior Styling**\n\nAggressive lines and large grills&where would we be without them? In a time where car designs are edgier than an angsty teenager, the clean flowing lines of Tesla\u0019s vehicles are a welcome sight. That\u0019s not to say I\u0019ve always felt this way. When the Model S got its facelift, I protested. When the Model 3 was unveiled, I swore it off due to its duck-lips-like front facia. The Model 3 just didn\u0019t look like a conventional car. Then again, isn\u0019t that the paradigm Tesla is working to uproot? The BMW now blends right into the crowd. From behind I\u0019d almost mistake the 2020 redesign for a Lexus. Almost.\n\n**Interior Design &amp; Finish**\n\nAs for the interior...well...it\u0019s somewhat of a tossup. Each get equal points for styling either for Tesla\u0019s take on the \u001cApple approach\u001d of elegant simplicity or the BMW\u0019s sense of familiarity and class. Yes, there\u0019s a lot of buttons and walnut but it\u0019s such an accommodating and inviting cabin. On Tesla\u0019s approach, I find the openness and natural light lends to a more relaxing environment. I love them both. \n\nNow let\u0019s talk about materials. Tesla\u0019s vegan \u001cleather\u001d disappoints only in the mind. I find the material much more satisfying to touch and feel when compared against the Napa leather seats I had in the Bimmer. They\u0019re also much more comfortable to sit in but they SORELY lack support when cornering. The rest of the cabin is also much more pleasant to touch in the Tesla where the BMW had some cold hard plastics in places it shouldn\u0019t have. \n\nHowever, premium materials and build-quality aren\u0019t mutually exclusive. Tap the various panels and compartments in the BMW and you\u0019ll find them satisfyingly solid where the Tesla is hollow. Sometimes too hollow. The upper interior panels of the doors in my 3 for example have far too much flex as does the headliner above the driver\u0019s seat. Don\u0019t get me started on the piano black center console. \n\n**Driving Dynamics**\n\nWhere the BMW is definitely the driver\u0019s car centered around the experience and connection with the road, the Tesla skips or misses the same level of engagement and response. That\u0019s not to say the driving dynamics are any less satisfying, but the experience\u0014exhilarating or otherwise does itself at times feel simulated. \n\nBMW: Sir, the outside wheel is slipping. We\u0019re about to go sideways. Shall we proceed?\n\nTesla: I\u0019ve corrected your mistake and allowed the rear to kick-out within manageable parameters. Wasn\u0019t that fun.\n\nIn the end, despite their fundamentally different behavior, I find them equally ready to be both the daily driver and the weekend warrior. \n\n**Technology**\n\nCars have become increasingly connected and complex machines. Tesla has a history of designing their automobiles from the ground up to be so much more. However, I find the more intriguing question to be whether or not it\u0019s as affective as it is disruptive. Is car culture ready for Autonomous Driving and the Tesla touch?\n\nWhile the Bimmer shamelessly outclasses the Tesla in equipment options, the Tesla holds a clear edge with its potential. Yes, there\u0019s no gauge cluster. There\u0019s \\*almost\\* no buttons and no tactile response. You WILL get over it. Touchscreens were a foreign concept when the iPhone first came out. Now, they\u0019re second nature.\n\nThis is not to say that Tesla\u0019s execution and adoption of Technology are perfectly implemented. Basic creature comforts are missing with no clear indication of why. There\u0019s no CarPlay. No routing options to avoid highways. No ventilated cooled seats. No HUD. No powered trunks. \n\n**Cost of Ownership**\n\nOne of the first things on anyone\u0019s mind when my Tesla comes up in conversation is its environmental and economic benefits. I\u0019ll admit that neither of these factors had much of an influence on my purchase, but I did make an effort to track these costs. As I have a daily commute of about 13 miles, I am able to easily top off with a 120v charger connected to a Currant smart outlet that monitors usage in real-time and provides a monthly report. \n\n2019 Tesla Model 3 AWD \n\nFuel: $545.04 (3,893.17 KWh @ $0.14c/KWh)\n\n Maintenance: $137.49 \n\n Repairs: $2,916.80 \n\n Insurance: $2,022.72/yr\n\n **Total: $5,622.05**\n\n2015 BMW 328i \n\n Fuel: $1,575 \u0013 estimated (20 MPG @ 3.50/gal for Premium)\n\n Maintenance: $283.99\n\n Repairs: $1,009.94\n\n Insurance: $1,887.60/yr\n\n **Total: $4,756.53**\n\n**Service Experience**\n\nTesla\u0019s service experience leaves A LOT to be desired. Facilities are few and far between with exceedingly long wait times. Service centers can\u0019t be reached by phone and the only way to communicate with a service advisor is via text.  I have had to wait an average of 6 weeks for body work and 1-2 weeks for general service and maintenance requests. Avoid damaging your car at all costs. \n\nMy experience with BMW\u0019s service centers was exceptional. My service advisor went above and beyond to be available and accommodate requests on my schedule. Repairs were carried out quickly, but did have one return visit for an issue that could have been easily avoidable. \n\n**Summary**\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Tesla\u0019s Model 3 and hope that those on the fence at least keep an open mind when shopping for their next vehicle. You'll experience some growing pains, but the convenience of fitting an Electric vehicle into your life might just surprise you.",

      "text": "So I have had my M3 to the dealer twice to try and get rid of a fairly often occurring \"sweet\" solvent/chemical smell.  I don't know exactly what ethylene-glycol smells like, but my guess is this might be it.  This is NOT the mildew/mold/dirty sock smell people have had lots of issues with.\n\nI've had my car since April this year (new with 17 miles) and it is a 2018 built in Sept. last year.  It sat on a lot for many months before I purchased it.  I've smelled this odor occasionally when I first got the car but I honeslty thought the smell was coming from outside in the environment, like a local chemical plant.  Recently the chemical odor seems to be getting stronger and staying for longer.  The smell goes away when I put the car on recirculate.  It only happens when pulling in fresh air with the AC.\n\nMy first trip to the SC resulted in them doing the standard AC condenser clean out and new filters... which did nothing for this smell.  I just got back from my second trip today.  They kept it over a day or two and said they had 6 people, including the service manager and head techs get in the car with full AC on, both inside the shop and outside when it got hot.  No one could smell any odors emanating from the vents.  They also did a thermal check on the AC (which, from what I understand, just checks the temp of the air coming from the vents) and visually checked for a leak.  They said they can't reproduce the smell and the AC should be fine since it's cold air and they don't see any leaks.\n\nWhile driving back with my family (I live 2.5  hours away from this particular SC), the smell came back after a brief rainstorm on the interstate... it was VERY strong this time.  My wife smelled it and my boys smelled it, so at least I know I'm not crazy or severely sensitive to smells.  I really don't want to be breathing this in since I'm not sure what it is and it can be nauseating after 10-20 minutes.  Turning on recirculate always makes it go away, but I don't think I should have to do that every time I start to smell it.\n\nI'm probably going to try a different SC next that has a much larger volume of business.  Has anyone experienced anything remotely like this and were you able to find a remedy?  I'm getting desperate to get rid of this odor!",

      "text": "Hey folks, recent follower of this sub, I am highly considering switching from gas to EV.\n\nThe car I am looking at is the AWD long range Model 3, converting over from a V6 Subaru Legacy (love the car and Subaru, just getting tired of paying for gas and other maintenance stuff and would rather be better for the environment)\n\nI\u0019d like to inquire about your experience owning a Tesla, especially those who have driven one for over a year. There are a few things that Im still concerned about:\n\n1. How has your experience been with general maintenance? From what I can tell online, tire rotation is something you still keep up with, anything else?\n\n2. For those who have had other bigger issues like damage to the car or some kind of failure that required going back to Tesla, whats that experience like?\n\n3. Longevity. My biggest concern is how the vehicle fares over a longer period of time. The one thing gas cars have over EVs is that our society is pretty good at handling gas cars for long periods of ownership - most shops can take care of the majority of problems, both mechanical and superficial (car body) issues, and many cars can last decades of driving. However,EVs are relatively new to mass market. Has this been an issue for anyone when a bigger failure happens to your Model 3? Do you have any concerns or issues the longer you drive your EV?\n\nThanks for your feedback, would love to hear from the community on this!",

      "text": "First off, I'm shocked that I even got this update this early. I'm not some Tesla employee nor do I have any affiliation with them. Do let me know down below how many of y'all have also gotten this update. \n\nmy cars a 2018 Model 3. A quick background, I did upgrade my HW 2.5 to HW 3 because I just couldn't resist it =\u001c (cost me $1157 to upgrade the chip.)\n\nI live in DC and commute often to NYC and other cities like Arlington and Baltimore so my FSD has had decent exposure to various environments. My annual mileage is 30k miles, yeah I like driving. \n\nThe name of the game for this update is: smoothness.\n\n\u0005 Stop signs: Wow. Love love it. DC drivers are assholes and don't usually wait for their turn. STILL, V12 managed to handle this flawlessly by still waiting for it's turn but once it knows for a fact that it is its turn, it starts creeping and goes confidently. No creeping just to check like previous days nor awkward waiting.\n\n\u0005 Variable speed: Done well IMO. You can turn this feature on or off but what it does is that it just adjusts the speed based on what it feels is right. Basically it doesn't mind exceeding the speed limit. I'm not sure what parameters it uses to determine this. Eg. The speed limit in the state park facing my house is 25mph but nobody really drives that speed. It seems to maybe look at other drivers and mimics so it drove around 30-38 mph.\n\n\u0005 Lane drift: gone.\n\n\u0005 Unprotected left turns: Its decisive. While driving out of my neighborhood, it almost tailgated the car in front of me while making a left turn even though there was an oncoming car at a reasonable speed coming in the opposite direction. Seems pretty human to me. Kept a safe distance.\n\n=@ No turn on right: previously it didn't listen to it unless there was a red arrow. Now it seems to be following that sign, although it did creep forward then kinda like stopped and realized it was a no turn on red? Needs more testing.\n\nL Very difficult maneuvers: DC is famous for complex roads and intersections. For really really hard moves (like needing to immediately move all the way right on the highway while in a traffic jam then taking an exit then needing to move all the way left, again with traffic and like pretty close to a traffic light,) attaching photo for reference.\n\n\u0005 Highway driving: didn't notice much difference (which is a good thing) other than it being able to merge onto the highway despite a very short entry point. That one merge on the highway has been a hallmark for how good you're able to handle high pressure situations and FSD did it flawlessly. I don't know how much adjustments they've made to highway driving, maybe just minor improvements. But I do know that the mapping and FSD seem to be slightly more decoupled now. It doesn't force you to move to the suggested lane anymore. Definitely more natural but on the map it still shows the suggested lane to be in.\n\n=@ End of drives: Still needs more testing but from what I've experienced, it does indeed pull over like people mentioned online.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else y'all wanna know =",

She started driving this car about 4 months ago.\n\nThis morning she left for work at about \\~6 am and with fall approaching it is now dark out, and she encountered a deer on the 4 lane divided highway (2 each way). It wasn't raining or wet, but it may have been slightly damp in the morning from dew/fog.\n\nShe called me afterwards because she was shaken up - she said she swerved to avoid the deer, but then after that, in her words, 'the car felt like it was driving itself and going left and right across both lanes without me doing anything'. She didn't hit anything or anyone, there were no cars immediately near her, and she is fine now, but I would like to be able to explain what might have happened to her.\n\nShe never drives with cruise control on (this car only has the basic cruise control to maintain speed, not even adaptive cruise in this car, but she never uses it). She confirmed she didn't have it on this drive. She also said she did not hear any beeps or alarms during the event. She knows what that sounds like, because when I drive the car with basic cruise control on and the car thinks a parked car is in our path (when the parked car turns red on the display and the warning noise comes on), and she said didn't hear that or see anything like that. I think it's likely there was a lot happening and she didn't notice the screen or sounds. \n\nShe did not like the swerving and she feels like she would have done better if the car had let her drive. She felt like the car wasn't responding to her steering inputs - not sure if she was just skidding and didn't have traction, or if emergency lane departure avoidance steering input was just stronger than her input. Her description raised some questions in my mind.\n\nDoes that sound like a situation where Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance would come on, and how that would respond? From [Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/blog/more-advanced-safety-tesla-owners):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance**  \nEmergency Lane Departure Avoidance is designed to steer a Tesla vehicle back into the driving lane if our system detects that it is departing its lane and there could be a collision, or if the car is close to the edge of the road. This feature will automatically be enabled at the beginning of every drive, but can be turned off for a single drive by going to the Autopilot Controls menu. \n\nMy wife said she didn't think her swerve to avoid the deer would have resulted in her driving off the road, but it seems plausible that the system seeing a swerve to avoid a deer at highway speed thought that the car was about to go off the road and correct back the other direction, and potentially over correct, resulting in the back and forth my wife described?\n\nAlternatively, could it be just basic traction control working that makes it feel like that?\n\nFinally, prior to the model 3 she drove a front wheel drive Honda Civic, so could another possibility be that the rear wheel drive tesla was fish tailing after the sudden swerve to avoid the deer? I drive the model 3 occasionally, and it feels pretty planted and I'm sure the traction control normally prevents oversteer, but could she have been experiencing the feeling of a 'loose rear end' for the first time?(haha don't let her read that!) She is far from a driving enthusiast so she couldn't describe what FWD vs RWD vs AWD/4WD would feel like in different skid situations. \n\nI would like to talk with her about it, starting from the decision to swerve to avoid the deer, and also suggest some fun advanced driving classes with an instructor to experience skids and skid recovery in a controlled environment to know what that feels like, but ultimately I think whatever the car did probably was the safest outcome. I keep trying to convince her to upgrade to FSD and to actually use it, she has a long commute with variable and very bad traffic when returning home, and I feel like the system is safer more consistently than a human, and this experience won't help convince her unless I can explain what happened. \n\nAppreciate any feedback!",

      "text": "Hi all, we have a Model 3 SR+ with an LFP battery which we\u0019ve had for only two weeks. We\u0019ve got 229 miles on it and our trips tend to be ~ 25 - 45 miles. We both work from home, so there are days when neither of us drive. In the short time we\u0019ve had Firefly, we\u0019ve noticed something which has spawned some range anxiety.\n\nCase in point: My wife drives about 31 miles (round trip) to the grand kids house and back a couple of times a week. This week, we\u0019ve noticed range drops by ~ 20% for these short drives. For example, Firefly was at 75% this morning and 55% when my wife got back from her short jaunt. She was at my daughter\u0019s house for a few hours and I noticed that she had sentry mode on (not sure why, she probably didn\u0019t even realize sentry was on), so that might have been a factor, I suppose.\n\nDoing the math, 20% of an expected range of 253 (LFP battery range) should be ~ 50 miles, not 30. I realize the weather is colder now, but not that cold here in Northern Virginia yet. It\u0019s ~ 44 Fahrenheit right now. If the math is consistent (10% usage per 15.5 miles), we\u0019re looking at a range of 155 miles. We are both in our 60s and don\u0019t do the \u001cspeed racer\u001d thing at all. \n\nMight this be indicative of an issue? Or should we be expecting a compromise to our range this severe, once the weather turns colder? The car is parked inside (garage), but not in a heated environment. The bottom line is that we are wondering how concerned we should be - or even IF we should be concerned.\n\nComments and advice would be appreciated. Thanks all.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!  I\u0019m planning on taking my first road trip with my SR+ this summer, and wanted to hear from anyone with experience using trip planner. \n\nMy route will take me across 2/3 of the US and back.  When mapping it out with trip planner, I noticed it calculates the time spent driving and charging for every stop.  Since this will be the first time I make a drive like this, my only concern is how effective it\u0019s charging calculation is, depending on the speed I\u0019ll be driving.  \n\nI realize it\u0019s probably making it\u0019s calculation to only have me charge enough to arrive at the next supercharger with a low SOC (to allow higher kW when starting to charge), but not so low that it\u0019s almost 0% when I arrive.  \n\nHowever, most of the route will be through states with 75-80mph speed limits.  I have certainly seen the difference in kWh/mi when going 60mph vs 70mph, so does trip planner take the local speed limits across the entire route when calculating the charge times?  Or does it just use the rated kWh/mi as a flat constant for the entire trip?\n\nI\u0019m curious if anyone has any experience they\u0019d like to share regarding trip planner\u0019s estimate accuracy, or a trip they mapped out themselves. I\u0019m an engineer by trade and thoroughly enjoy these kind of experiments on how small changes in the environment or driving style can affect the car\u0019s efficiency, so I\u0019m very excited for that aspect of my trip.  But I\u0019d love to hear if anyone can speak to this at all or have even calculated their own road trip route that seemed to work better.  Thank you!",

Bad for the environment since I'm just driving around everywhere and anywhere, wasting energy.  I would actually drive more, but I have family obligations.

Also, people saying to leave it on the charger, what do you need your phone for, it's a distraction if it is mounted, yada, yada... everyone's situation is different, so if your situation is your 40 minute commute to work and back, your input is not needed here, some people need a phone mount that is reliable and in a good spot with quick access.\n\nTrying to start a post of options that people have actually used with some sort of input of the product along with pictures. \n\nI went through many universal mounts in the past that usually failed me around a year's time or less. A few years ago I switched to Proclip USA and solely used it in all my vehicles with no issues. Amazing product, the problem is they currently don't make one for the Highland and the previous generation Model 3 mount was in a terrible spot along the vent on the left. \n\nI'm open to a 'jerry rigged' setup as long as it is clean looking and functions as intended. So, with that being said, input from owners of the previous generation Model 3 or the Model Y would also be appreciated if it is something that would also work with the new generation Model 3.\n\nAttached pics are locations that I think would be the most functional from the short of amount of time I've spent with the car.\n\nThanks!

      "text": "Was looking into a Tesla is it really less expensive than a gas car. Was told by an electrician it\u0019s $700-$1000 to run the line plus the cost of the charger. I know gas is high right now but our electric company just got another increase.  It\u0019s strange talking to a Tesla owner they aren\u0019t willing to say how expensive it is to run. One owner said he bought his because the carbon footprint that  cars leave. Told him I thought I read where they make the batteries are bad for the environment. I know you have some maintenance on gas cars change plugs every 100,000 and Antifreeze. Is it real expensive to charge on road trips?  Also heard if you use the A/C it really affects the range your car gets.  I guess really need to know pros and cons and if you own one for over a year what it cost to run it. ",

Not to protect your automotive grade screen. \n\nI bet most would find it absurd to leave an ICE vehicle idling in the parking lot the entire day for the sole purpose of ensuring their seats don\u0019t get too hot while their at work/home/whatever, yet using Cabin Overheat Protection, especially with A/C On, is the same thing, though admittedly more efficient. \n\nFan only isn\u0019t as bad but still keeps the car awake all day and runs your fan, pulling air through your cabin filter and reducing its life in addition to burning unnecessary energy.\n\nOne of the reasons many of us drive EVs is to help the environment, turning off Cabin Overheat Protection is an Easy, no compromise way of doing that.\n\nIf you don\u0019t do it for the environment, maybe you do it for the $$$ savings. Why piss them away keeping your seats from getting as hot as the rest of the cars in the parking lot?\n\nLast reason to turn it off, reduce the chances of dirty sock smell by not keeping your evaporator damp all day all summer because the AC is on. Side benefit that your compressor, fans, and battery will last longer with fewer hours of use and cycles being put on them.",

      "text": "Returning my model 3 lease has been so excruciatingly painful that I will never buy another tesla, Hell, I don't even want to get in another tesla car ever again - that's how much I hate tesla right now.   \n\n\nHere are the basics:\n\nMy lease was up last october &amp; was planning on trading it in for the model Y. I spoke to someone at the time &amp; they said there isn't any inventory, et etc. and they're just extending everyone's leases by 6 mos. I though, cool, more time for hyperinflation to calm down and more options, etc. I understood that the lease extension would trigger automatically, but it didn't - I had to request it through the app.   \nSo, my lease end date lapsed, and then by the time I figured out I had to extend it manually through the app, I didn't have that option anymore, because the lease had lapsed. I also couldn't start the return process, because... you guessed it, lease had lapsed, app didn't know what to do. No one would help me - \"has to be done through the app\"  \n\n\nSo I'm stuck for 3 or 4 months in limbo. meanwhile I didn't get a registration renewal notice, because that was built into the lease return date etc. So the car is not registered &amp; my insurance eventually also dropped me because of lack of registration.   \n\n\nEventually, something changed, and tesla charged my card on file for all my back payments, and started debiting my card monthly again - like a lease, except that there was no official lease extension. No one would help me. Couldn't find anyone to talk to.  \n\n\nThe main thing I wanted to know is how much it was going to cost me to return the car (there was some minor damage, and I went over the miles) - no help. \"return the car and we'll tell you by email, when there's no one to scream at\"  \n\n\nHere's my main beef. It ended up costing me almost 10k to return the car - yes you heard it TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. What I really wanted to do, which would have cost nothing, is convert my lease into a purchase and just keep the car that I was happy with. Sure it had a few scratches and was over the allowed miles, but who cares! I had a car I was happy with.   \n\n\nInstead, Tesla forced me to return the car and hand them a bunch of money and then tried to sell me a new lease!! \"Give us 10k, and you can have the exact same car back\" FUCK THAT.   \n\n\nThe official explanation for not allowing customers to buy out the leases was that tesla was going to build a fleet of self driving cars, which is utter bullshit. They're not doing anything close to that. When I pointed that out, the reply was, \"no one knows what the reason is, you just can't convert it to a purchase... you just can't\"   \n\n\nOf course the obvious reason is that they're making more money by nickle and diming lease returners to death and then reselling those cars at a tidy profit.   \n\n\nI was an early adopter of telsa products and used to be a huge fan, now I am just filled with rage every time I think about tesla or Elon's stupid smug face.   \n\n\nIt was never about saving the environment or promoting the adoption of green energy, it's just about making money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "Going back to gas...",
      "text": "\n2013...\n\nThat\u0019s the year I first joined the Tesla Family with a fully spec\u0019d out P85. I, like many of us Tesla fans went full blown fan boy in 3.2 seconds.  It was love at first sight and I was determined to live a long life without the need of gas ever again. \n\nSix months into a blissful ownership experience I had to schedule my first service. I was so excited. Tesla came to my house with a loaner, reviewed paperwork, and took my P85 off for its first regular maintenance (that was a thing back then).  \n\nEverything seemed to go fine until I got a phone call while I was watching my car come back to me on the app. It was the flat bed truck driver. There was an accident and the big straps that secured my vehicle to the flat bed had broken and my car was damaged. \n\nTesla\u0019s response to the accident was horrendous. It took two plus months to get my car back. I had originally requested a new car.  I didn\u0019t want to assume depreciation for an accident that I had no part of and I wanted my brand new unscathed P85 back in original form.   I had plenty of examples of dealerships replacing cars outright under similar circumstances.  They didn\u0019t. The whole experience was shitty and stressful but I stuck with it because I loved the movement. \n\nI should have known then that the next 7 years would be what I can only describe as an abusive relationship.  Every single service appointment had either a minor mishap or full blown \u001cI want a whole new car\u001d issue. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I drop off my 2018 M3P to the service center for the squeaky front suspension issue. I posted about it here because I didn\u0019t like how they didn\u0019t automatically assume this was a warranty repair. So you can read that if you\u0019re interested lol. \n\nI never would have predicted what would happen next. \n\nDropped off the car Friday morning. Nothing was done the whole day. Typical but at this point I don\u0019t expect great customer service so whatever.   That night we had some thunderstorms roll through but nothing that made me fear what I\u0019d hear after the weekend. \n\nMonday afternoon I get a phone call from the service center. My car was caught in a serious flood Friday night. The water rose up over the interior seats, the battery is damaged, and the car would probably be totaled. \n\nNow clearly this is an Act of God and no ones fault.  However, I wanted to see how Tesla would handle this.  I wanted to give them a chance to exceed my expectations. \n\nFirst - they want me to use my insurance.  For many reasons that I\u0019m not listing here. No. That\u0019s not an option. The car was under your care. \n\nSecond - it\u0019s been a week and no loaner or rental has been offered.  I know loaners are in short supply. Offer me something. Anything. I\u0019ve got nothing. \n\nThird - I made an appointment to visit the service center and remove things out of my car. When I arrived, the battery was being decharged and I was told I couldn\u0019t go inside the car for risk of injury. Fine.  They weren\u0019t even going to let me get my belongings or see my car. I pushed back and asked if they could get everything for me since I had an appointment.\n\nI noticed a lot more damage than they told me so I took out my phone to take pictures. You would have thought I was about to set off a bomb. When I took out my phone, a service tech ran over to me trying to grab my phone out of my hand, screaming at me to stop, and told me I couldn\u0019t take pictures without signing an NDA. \n\nI was floored, ready to absolutely blow my top, but I kept my cool because I realized that wouldn\u0019t accomplish anything. \n\nIf I wasn\u0019t already done with Tesla. This did the trick. I couldn\u0019t believe it. He was almost physically attacking me and screaming at me. I had done nothing other than take my phone out. \n\nI immediately called a lawyer from the parking lot. To see what I could do to extract every penny out of them for this damage. \n\nI have no idea how this will play out. Tesla is still refusing to take any responsibility or show any care for me as a long term customer and advocate for the brand. If this were my first negative experience, it would be enough for me to go buy a car elsewhere.  However, this has been the most recent of literally 15 - 20 service calls over the where Tesla\u0019s reaction and support of my issues has been so far below reasonable expectation that it is time for me to walk away. \n\nSo take this cautionary tale for what it\u0019s worth. My experience isn\u0019t everyone\u0019s and I hope that they work to improve this. Because this experience does not live up to the hype that driving the car generates. Part of owning a car is the ownership experience. Tesla is failing at this miserably. \n\nI\u0019m left with no idea of how I\u0019m getting reimbursed, what I\u0019m getting reimbursed for, who is going to do it, and what I\u0019m supposed to do while I have no car.  \n\nI wish you all the best. Those 0-60 runs and supercharger trips have been a blast. But I\u0019m going to give them another 7 years to figure the service and support end out until I come back. \n\nUntil then...back to gas.",

      "text": "Hey everybody,\n\nI wanted to give the below a bit more awareness and spotlight as and discuss with you the current issue we are seeing with the M3P 2021 models and soon a lot of other models as well (SR+, LRs etc). \n\nAs some of you are aware, Tesla was putting in panasonic cells (E3D - type 2170l) into all 2021 performance cars, other models will follow soon or are currently already equipped with it. \n\nThe youtuber Bjorn Nyland did some testing in his videos ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2s71w2W9UA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2s71w2W9UA&amp;t=546s), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-2r4Y\\_lUsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-2r4Y_lUsk&amp;t=581s)) and figured out that currently the M3P2021 performs worse than an actual LR2021 model with heatpump, even worse compared to the M3P 2019 model. the worst part is that you could actually get into Limp Mode at 10%ish, causing the AC and most of electronics turn off so that you can make it to a charging station. \n\nThe big question now is: Is it due to the fact that the battery gets too cold due to the heatpump? Well no its not as the LR 2021 shows better performance with E5D LG cells. So its a combination of both the panasonic cells AND the cold. I would assume Tesla could - at 40 % - warm the battery instead of taking the warm air from it - and increase the performance at least a bit, but also the cells perform at a lower voltage - so I would assume its also related to hardware equipment. \n\nAs this does now affect most buyers, prospects and enthusiasts I would love to discuss it thoroughly with you guys as its still a rather secret information that most dont know about. People should know that you wont get the same performance with the current and future models that are based on panasonic cells than youtube suggests and tesla advertises. There is no statement from Tesla and we ( speaking on behalf of the tesla community ) would love to know how tesla will approach this issue and therefore would want to raise visibility specifially for this issue.\n\nIf you order performance, you should get consistent performance (as you had before). AT LEAST there should be an option to choose between range OR performance to give the user the choice whether they wanna slow down for the pupose of extended range or if they wanna go full throttle.",

      "text": "Came over to my friend's apartment last week to grab breakfast before work, there was no street parking so he opened the gate for me after driving around for a bit. \n\nLeft a little over an hour later and my car was gone. It got towed, called the towing company, and promptly picked it up and paid the tow fee ($146). This all happened in the time-span of 2 hours. \n\nI immediately scheduled mobile service because I know there are specific instructions to tow this car, and I am =¯ sure they've never towed a Tesla before as this is a very small town in Vermont. \n\nTesla Mobile Service came today to rotate my tires and take a look at the damage. He was unable to use one of the jack points because of this (http://imgur.com/a/iDjTt4J). He says it looks like they used the jack point incorrectly and punctured the aluminum shell, and pulled it out which is why the metal faces outward. \n\nThey say I may need to replace the battery pack, but he can't be sure until I visit a service center. I have an appointment for next week to get a final decision on it. \n\nIn the meantime I've requested footage of the tow, but the video is too bright because the sun was hitting the camera. I requested a download of the footage and will attempt to edit the highlights to get a clearer picture (who knows, depends on if they let me have it). \n\nI've filed a claim with my insurance company and they'll contact me back tomorrow after reviewing my statement for further instruction. \n\nAnything else I should do?",

      "text": "\nOk so I have seen many questions lately about LFP and charging to 100%.\n\nThe battery cells do not have an inherent requirement to be charged to 100%\n\nThe reason you should still charge to 100% at least once a week, is that the BMS (battery management system) will lose track over time of where the state of charge is.\n\nWhy does this happen then, and why doesn\u0019t the non-LFP batteries need it?\n\nIt comes down to the voltage curve. \n\nLFP has a very flat curve, or in this extreme example of the attached photo, maybe even fluctuates up in the middle of the discharge curve. (Not very common, but illustrates the issue at hand)\n\nThis mean that the BMS cannot rely on voltage alone to determine SoC. However this then means that it has to use the Ah in and out to determine how much is left. The problem with this is that the available Ah also fluctuates with factors like temperature and discharge rate.\n\nThis is why you need to charge to 100%, to give the BMS a reliable point to start counting down from. As the battery is charged to full, the voltage spikes, and this tells the BMS that the battery is full.\n\nNMC and most other lithium batteries have a more linear curve, which allows the BMS to use the voltage also to determine the current SoC, which negates the need for this calibration charge. \n\nHope this helps.",

I filled the battery to full charge from the USC area in Los Angeles and drove all the way to the vineyards near Ensenada.  I stopped at the Santo Tomas vineyards and they have a destination charger.\n\nIn fact if you keep driving the Valley of Guadalupe, you'll see a lot of the vineyards have destination chargers.\n\nI stayed there for about 2 hours and I was getting about 41 miles per hour of charging.\n\nI then drove to downtown Ensenada and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and they also have a destination charger.  I charged there the whole night.  I did complain that the charging speed was too slow and they said they would fix it.\n\nIn case you don't want to use a hotel with a destination charger they have brand new Superchargers nearby.\n\nI drove back to Los Angeles to drop off my mom and continued on to Santa Clarita with is another 40 miles past LA.  This was a complete trip on one charge.\n\nI hope this opens up this part of Mexico for you guys\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  Connectivity worked in Mexico, my phone switched to Telcel, but I didn't see anything on the Model 3 that switched over, it just worked.

      "title": "How Tesla Determines Degradation",
      "text": "Hey Tesla family. I know there have been a lot of posts discussing battery degradation and how we can assess real world degradation. I had an extended discussion with my local service center\u0019s lead technician, and he showed me some of their tools and test results from the battery health check. I tried to take pictures, but he quickly explained he would get reprimanded or fired if I did.\n\nThe battery health check has three components to it:\n1. How did the car perform on their longest drive within the last 30 days?\n2. Are there any errors or codes coming up in the HV system that don\u0019t show up as a displayed error on the screen?\n3. How does this car\u0019s Amp Hours compare to all Teslas of the same build?\n\nSo regarding the first test, they are able to see all your recent trips, and check to see the car\u0019s watt hours per mile for that trip. According to the technician, they want to see if the car is being used for a lot of aggressive launches, high speeds, etc. to see if that is causing rapid wear on the battery. I was at 260 wh/mile.\n\nThe second is basically a thumbs up/thumbs down situation. In my case, there were no errors so there was nothing to show.\n\nThe third test had the most information. It showed my car\u0019s battery (LR) amp hours compared to all other same-sized batteries of the same vehicle in the fleet, both brand new and first LR off the line. He noted that performance models were included in this summary. I\u0019m not sure if RWD would be included. This display also showed the bell curve of degradation for all Model 3s. The (assumed) brand new cars were at or close to 220 amp hours. My car was on the depressing side of the bell curve at 201 amp hours. The top of the bell curve was around 207 amp hours. The technician confirmed the displayed range accurately reflects battery degradation as long as the battery isn\u0019t very cold, and the owner has attempted to rebalance the battery (The Manager also confirmed the displayed range reflects the car\u0019s degradation). You could also hover over each bar on the bell curve to see the % of cars at the same level of degradation. 2.7% of Model 3s are at 201 amp hours. That is not a cumulative %. The technician estimated my car is within the 6-9 percentile in degradation (280 displayed range at 100%)\n\nIf you want to learn your battery\u0019s health, you can call and ask for a battery health check, and ask them to tell you your amp hour, and what percentage of Teslas have the same level of amp hours. It\u0019s also worth noting that the manager confirmed he is not aware of any Model 3 batteries being replaced from too much degradation. Model 3 battery replacement at this service center always had an intervening variable. He has seen Model S batteries replaced from excessive degradation.\n\nI hope you found this as interesting as I did. \n\nP.S. I also learned they plan out bug fixes many software updates in advance. My front speakers are cutting out periodically, and they said the software team has slated to work on a fix for that issue in version 40, but they still need more data points to nail down the problem.",

Not all service calls are bad, just hope any future ones are as easy as this one was.",

(40T km p.a.)\nThe reason I am considering leaving the P2 behind is simply: Range. The advertised 400 km (WLTP) are on the Autobahn (@130 km/h) more like 300(+-20 km.\n\n- Whats the real world highway range of the LR and Performance for a sporty driver going anywhere between 130 to 150 km/h? I usually drive between Stuttgart and Amsterdam or Paris. Lots of long distance travel. \n-Whats the real world charging performance? The P2 needs around 45 min to go from 10 to 80% (78kw battery, peak charging speed at 155kwh, after 50% 100 and slower)\n- I love the digital dashboard and am afraid the Center screen of the M3 is a little too minimalistic for my taste. Any accessories that at least let me see the speed and SoC?\n- Is there anything that you wish your Tesla had that you see in a car like the Polestar? (Besides Build Quality, lol)\n- Do Performance owners wish they would have opted for LR?\n\nMay Elon be with you. And thanks in advance!",

      "text": "This probably won\u0019t be a popular post but I\u0019ll post it anyways. I have had my M3LR for a little over a week and the car is a fantastic car overall and much better to drive than traditional ICE vehicles. However in my 10 days of ownership I have found there is one huge drawback that I think will slow down the mass transition to electric vehicles and it\u0019s range. I live in Iowa and it\u0019s winter now (anywhere from 10-40 degrees Fahrenheit) so I expected the range to decrease and I\u0019m willing to deal with the decreased range in the winter but I\u0019m not even getting 200 miles from a 90% full battery. I just drove ~65 miles and my battery went from 90% to 56% and I didn\u0019t have heat on for half the drive. If we want the mass transition to EVs as we all do cause we are part of this group, I\u0019d say the battery capacity needs to at least double to convince the average Joe or Jane to buy an EV. The car is great but I wouldn\u0019t recommend the car to anyone that doesn\u0019t want to deal with the drawbacks of the car -- range. It works great for daily driving, leave come back home plug in and wake up to a full car but road-trips are far from ideal compared to an ICE car. Something I\u0019m willing to deal with because I love the car but I don\u0019t see the majority of the population adopting EVs until chargers are more readily available and possibly charge faster. Just a thought and I\u0019d be interested to see if anyone else agrees/disagrees and why.",

      "text": "With so many new owners, and remembering that I learned this from here (rather than from the staff at the Tesla showroom), I wanted to do a PSA and pass along how v1 and v2 Superchargers work (more on v3 at the end).\n\nSuperchargers are paired; you'll see each pedestal is labeled like \"1A, 1B\".  These pedestals a pair.  Usually the pairs are next to each other, but I've been to at least 1 Supercharger that had them seemingly randomly placed.\n\nThe first person to plug into one of the two pedestals in a pair gets full power (assuming the battery is low enough to handle it).  The second person gets a minimum of 30%, with that going up as the other car's draw tapers down.  Once the first person leaves, the remaining car gets full power, and a new car plugging in where the first car was will get the 30% minimum.  \n\nEverybody gets the best experience when you leave the second half of the pair unoccupied (if that's an option).  I did a 1900 mile road trip this weekend, and I did notice a number of Superchargers where people were using both sides of a pair, even though the Supercharger didn't appear to be anywhere near full.  If the Supercharger is filling up, though, you won't upset the first driver by plugging into the second half of the pair, as their charge speed is not reduced.\n\nThe exceptions to this are newer v3 Superchargers (labeled as 250kW in the car display and other apps) and \"urban\" superchargers (labeled as 72kW).  At a v3 charger, all pedestals get full power.  Urban Superchargers are v2, but with the power evenly divided between pedestals as they're placed in locations where heavy traffic is expected.",

The fact that black was the free colour back then is nice since every Tesla I see nowadays is a grey Model Y.  At the time a lot of people were blacking out the chrome and I am happy I didn\u0019t since it is again unique compared to many on the road.\n\nMaintenance Summary Years 1-4 (warranty period);\n- Replaced back window glass (warranty)\n- Replaced a cracked windshield.\n- Replace control arms (warranty)\n\nMaintenance Year 5\n- Horn stopped working - $435\n- Compliance arm replaced - $2300\n- Charge port door stopped working - $400\n\nThe car has had a few problem since warranty ran out but I save approx $2500/year on gas so I am ok with it but hoping I don\u0019t see a similar spend in Year 6 or I might start to question the long term reliability.\n\nI have driven it 81000 km\u0019s and at  100% charge I still get 435km.  I charge at home with a No adapter and a dryer plug in my garage.  I exclusively use the mobile charger that came with the car.\n\nI wish I had the new centre console since my USB  ports are USB-A.  I put in an after market wireless charger since the lightning connectors cables won\u0019t fit the larger model iPhones on the console.  I also ditched the original aero wheel covers this year to the ones in the photos that I got off Temu.  They do a nice job of hiding 5 years of curb rash.  \n\nI live in the Toronto area and the automatic wipers are awful in winter weather.  My #1 pet peeve however is the navigation still does not account for the HOV lane on highway 404.  FSD improved dramatically with V12 but without a good navigation system it is bothersome to have the car always want to leave the HOv lane.  \n\nThat all said, the car is fast, sporty and fun to drive.  Battery still holds good charge and I get regular software updates.  \n\nI will see you again for my 10 year update. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fb1azxs7lub1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d27b58a59ae22d03299707d4058e27c4f2ac498\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7md8xcg8lub1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8d51b5261a2597bc3184cf49aee6ad64be33425\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/of9i2akh8lub1.jpg?width=2047&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d46e834d6acbc540c44038029556694e83a8b7c2\n\n[https://imgur.com/widWzwj](https://imgur.com/widWzwj)\n\nFirst off& I know not everyone wants or understands the need or desire for CarPlay& and that\u0019s fine. This is mostly a post intended for those who enjoy our Tesla Model 3 but wish it has this one feature. Happy to have a friendly debate about value of it but in the end& if you know you know and if you don\u0019t need or want it, that\u0019s fine too.\n\nAnd I know not all are fans of the \"second screen\" but I actually do like the look and how well it integrates with the interior and the ease of use versus using the browser is much nicer in my opinion.\n\nAbout a year ago, I posted a setup using a cheap tablet ($50 Fire 8 HD Plus) with a $65 CarLinkIt dongle that allowed for CarPlay. Not the most elegant solution and despite some minor improvements I tried (cleaning up wiring, wireless CarPlay dongle, etc)& while I worked fine, I thought there could be a cleaner and more integrated option. My original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/vh1vk6/apple\\_carplay\\_via\\_android\\_tablet\\_and\\_carlinkit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/vh1vk6/apple_carplay_via_android_tablet_and_carlinkit/)\n\nThat\u0019s about when TeslaAndroid became more mainstream, simplifying the project to only require a single Raspberry Pi (instead of two with a video capture device). So I decided to give this a try. The TeslaAndroid project has made tremendous improvements and I kept up with all of the releases& but to me, it wasn\u0019t a perfect solutions. I would run into issues with the UI slowing down randomly on some days& needing often reboot the Raspberry Pi to reset things& to video playback in other apps like YouTube being too slow/jittery. I was also using a USB LTE adapter with the Raspberry Pi and it worked \u001cOK\u001d but internet connectivity always felt a bit sluggish. I dunno if maybe it has to with my Model 3 being a 2020 model with older computer, but the performance was fair/good on the best days, and sometimes fair/poor& rarely excellent/perfect.\n\nTeslaAndroid Raspberry Pi - [Photo](https://imgur.com/T2sFPga)TeslaAndroid in my Model 3 - [Photo](https://imgur.com/pUN3c8V)\n\nSo I recently decided to go back to my \u001cdual screen\u001d setup (which I actually quite liked the look of to be honest& although I know it\u0019s not for everyone). But I also wanted to make some improvements to the last time I tried this configuration.\n\n**Things I didn\u0019t like about the v1 of my 2nd Screen Tablet setup:**\n\n* ***Charging*** \\- To charge the tablet, I had a wireless charger on the back of the Fire tablet. It worked but the charging speed was too slow and I would lose charge while using the system even while wireless charging. The combination of running the tablet and the power draw of the CarLinkIt dongle along with wired CarPlay charging my iPhone& the wireless charging could not keep up.\n* ***Budget Tablet*** \\- The Fire 8 HD Plus is \u001cgood enough\u001d but since I was trying to remedy \u001clatency\u001d of the Tesla Android setup& I knew I could do better.\n* ***Internet connectivity*** \\- The USB LTE stick \u001cworked\u001d but it wasn\u0019t great or super reliable. So I wanted a tablet with 5G built in.\n\n**So for Version 2 of the 2nd Screen Tablet CarPlay setup I upgraded the following:**\n\n* ***Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite with 5G*** \\- Found this on OfferUp for $75 and it\u0019s a slightly larger 8.7\u001d screen and has 5G built in. It\u0019s definitely better than the Fire tablet and runs Android 13 but if I end up preferring this setup, I may upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 or S8.  The 5G internet is \"free\" as I had an extra line on my AT&amp;T account, what they call a ghost line, so I took a SIM for that line that's supposed to be a phone and I've been using it for unlimited data for well over a year with no issues. I also have a 5G Hot Spot stand-alone device I can use if I end up getting a better tablet that does not have 5G built in.\n* ***Simultaneous Charging + OTG*** \\- So this gets a little technical but in summary, USB devices that transfer data with Android us what is called \u001cUSB OTG\u001d (USB On The Go) and the spec says you can\u0019t do data and power at the same time. This is mostly \u001ctrue\u001d but I found a [$90 device from LavaLink](https://lavalink.com/lavasimulcharge/product/nsync-vc3u/) that gets around this limitation somehow and it supports Samsung (and a few other) tablets. So I was about to order one of these but on a whim, I decided to try a random \u001cpowered\u001d USB C hub I had that home and to my surprise it worked for both charging the Samsung tablet AND simultaneously supporting CarPlay. In full transparency, while it works all the time, most of the time it is sometimes only around 10-150 mA charge rate but sometimes it shows 1,600+ mA charge rate. Regardless, even with the slower charge rate, it keeps the tablet at 100% most of the time and on long drives, the tablet may drop to 85% or so, but when parked, it\u0019s back at 100%. I may get a power management device that limits charge level to 80% for better battery health but we will see about that.\n* ***MacroDroid Macros*** \\- I also am using this app to automate entry/exit from the car. So on entry, as the tablet connects to Bluetooth, MacroDroid wakes the tablet, sets the brightness to auto, disables WiFi, etc.  As I leave the car, as Bluetooth disconnects, MacroDroid turns off the tablet screen, etc& and if I\u0019m at home, enables WiFi. I\u0019m working on some other optimizations using this cool app. [Clip demonstrating power off on BT disconnect](https://imgur.com/eOHXfxD)\n\nApple CarPlay works great as you would expect& both wired and wireless. There is zero latency and it works as good or better than I've seen in OEM CarPlay examples from Volkswagen, Mazda, etc.  I\u0019ve always preferred wired though and I\u0019ll keep trying both to find the best option for me. I like wired as it charges my phone and is 100% reliable.\n\nI do use the tablet for other stuff besides CarPlay, like [YouTube](https://imgur.com/Tcs246Q) and [DirecTV streaming](https://imgur.com/kMzKuWj). Sure, many will judge saying it\u0019s dangerous and illegal to have videos playing in sight of the driver and I don\u0019t disagree& but for several years, while driving, I mostly just LISTENED to podcasts, audiobooks, etc&. Including some YouTube creator videos I would have setup in a \"watch later\" playlist but even when this was being done from my phone, because I have YouTube Premium& I close the app and just the audio streams through. Same with DirecTV, I mostly enjoy listening to a football game or news shows\u0019 audio and rarely looked at the video. Sure with this setup it\u0019s easier and more tempting to look at videos but I just don\u0019t because most of the shows I enjoy is just for the audio commentary and don\u0019t need to see the people talking.\n\nFor phone calls, because of the way I use the tablet for audio content, the tablet is connected to the Tesla\u0019s Bluetooth. I rarely if ever talk on the phone, most of my work is done via email, Microsoft Teams, or text message. For any calls or conferences I need to be on, I can either switch BT to my phone or just use a pair of AirPods I leave in the car for spontaneous incoming calls. It works well. I may change how I do this but it\u0019s working for now. I'm considering maybe using Google Voice to get my calls natively on the Samsung tablet... but we'll see.  I just don't get enough phone calls for this to really matter to be honest.\n\nBy the way, my car is parked in my home garage 90% of the time and if I ever park anywhere sketchy, a simple disconnect of one USB C cable and I pull off the tablet from it's magnetic mount and hide it away... so no concerns over theft or break in.\n\nAnyhow, that's the latest update.  I'm happy with this setup and it's much more reliable and a better user experience than I was having using TeslaAndroid.  TeslaAndroid is still a good option for those that want CarPlay in a more integrated manner, but even as a seasoned IT guy, the constant tinkering and stuff,  just got to a point I rarely wanted to use it.",

      "text": "\nPreviously, retro gaming using an emulator on Tesla\u0019s browser was impractical (you had to go on sites like abetterTheater etc..) not such a big deal, but the real barrier was the ability to save games!!! This made it a novelty rather than a viable option.\n\nHowever, I discovered that it no longer has to be just a novelty. There is a website called AfterPlay.io, which offers a free basic account (with a premium option that provides more consoles and features). This cloud emulator saves your games to the cloud, allowing you to access and continue your games from any device with a web browser.\n\nI should note that you are only supposed to download ROMs for games you own hard copies of, so don't go downloading ROMs from the vast collection at r/roms unless you own those games.\n\nTo get started, download a ROM for a game you own, such as SNES Super Mario Kart, from r/roms. Then, upload the file to your AfterPlay.io account.\n\nOnce you create an account, you can log in from your Tesla and map your controller by heading to controls &gt; gamepad. I found the process of assigning buttons a bit tricky, requiring some trial and error, but once figured out, it worked great!\n\nI ordered this pair of Bluetooth 2.0 SNES controllers, which work great (2 for under $30): https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-iNNEXT-Raspberry-Multicolored/dp/B07MBF7FN1/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1\n\nFor something fancier that people seem to really like, check out: https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Raspberry-Nintendo/dp/B0CX4YD6T6/ref=sr_1_45?sr=8-45\n\nAlso if you only have a usb data port from your glovebox you can get a hub with Bluetooth 3.0 for your TeslaCam thumb drive (or hdd) and the other port hubs 2.0 for these Bluetooth controller dongles. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4NM66WL\n\n\nThere are other controller options including the older Xbox one controller that does not need any dongle (model 1708 which would be shown in battery compartment)\n\nThese last couple of weeks have been awesome. The maximize browser feature came just in time for the Euro and Copa America, and now this discovery& Enjoy, my friends!\n\n",

      "title": "Own a M3 LR, but got a SR loaner during repairs&and here are some thoughts afterwards",
      "text": "*The audio system*\n\t\n- \tSometimes you really don\u0019t realize something until its gone. I remember I test drove the SR before ordering my LR, and thought the audio system wasn\u0019t \tbad. At the time I didn\u0019t even know it was the SR tbh, I was just too excited to test drive it, so everything I liked was probably skewed due to my \tenthusiasm. \n\n\tBut after driving one again for a couple days, I noticed that there was a HUGE difference in the audio system for the music I listen to, with the bass being \tthe most obvious difference and that is very important to me. My enjoyment from listening to music drastically diminished. \n\n*The weight of the car*\n\n- \tSome people have said that they don\u0019t notice the weight difference, but I definitely noticed it. The SR definitely feels lighter and almost deceptively quicker, just because it feels lighter on its feet. That is until you floor it, which leads me to my next point. \n\n*Acceleration* \n\n- This one is obvious. I was quickly reminded of how much quicker the LR is than the SR, especially with the acceleration boost. But that goes without saying, the SR is still more than quick enough for daily driving, especially with how much lighter it feels at times surprisingly. \n\n\tBut what was really funny was when my GF drove it and we took off from a red light, she said \u001cWow I really didn\u0019t feel the speed or acceleration there. That was slow!\u001d LOL&that hurt my manhood just a tad haha. Couldn\u0019t wait to get shadow(my car) back. \n\n*The Range*\n\n-\tAnother obvious one. My commute are about 70 miles round trip 3 times a week and I usually return with 62% battery from the initial 100%, which is more than enough, and this is also traveling at 70-75mph with 19inch wheels. So I can definitely say I can see why people get the SR if their commutes aren\u0019t long or don\u0019t drive much. \n\n\tBut&&.. I live on the east coast and I also live in an apartment and take roadtrips quite a bit, and with my driving habits AND THE COLD, I am definitely happy with the LR as my choice. I think knowing that I may not have the ability to charge overnight also helps my decision. Granted living in my area, there are a ton of superchargers so its not a concern if I cant snag a charging spot in my apartment for whatever reason. (Ive never had a problem doing so).\n\n\t I was quite surprised with how much battery I returned with after charging to 100% during the summer, which made me a little more anxious when just going out anywhere and incase I cannot get a charging spot on my way back home. So during the winter it would be much worse. \n\n\nOverall\n\n- \tGet whatever car suits your lifestyle or preference, but the LR was definitely worth the price increase in my book and I know that I made the right choice after going back to the SR for a little bit. Just my 2 cents \f\u000f",

This is 75 miles a day, 300 miles a week, potentially 15,000 miles in a year.\n\nMy existing 2014 Lexus CT200h has about 195,000 miles amounting to about 21,000 miles/year. I\u0019ve had the head gasket issue resolved, was rear ended once but insurance covered the repair, have typical wear and tear on it but do have some dents/scratches on hood and side mirror as bike fell off rack and separate freeway incident involved shovel smashing the side mirror light cover. Aside from the cosmetics, it\u0019s been running great and feel like it may be able to keep going another 200K keeping note of brake maintenance with rotors and pads change and potential hybrid battery change some time too.\n\nTrade-In and some quick quotes on the car have been demoralizing at $2000. I was hoping it would be at least $12,000.\n\nSelling it for $12K made me have hope to bring in a new Tesla Model 3 to finance and have autopilot for a potentially less stressful commute experience and take advantage of solar and charging at home.\n\nNot sure what private sale would look like on my car, any idea? But main question for here is if you were in this position, do you take advantage of the $7500 fed and $2000 ca EV credits and get the Tesla. Or do you ride out the Lexus til it dies and explore public transportation instead (drive to metrolink station and take that for the commute)?\n\nAny feedback on the car and scenario would be amazing!",

      "text": "Based on all these recent posts from owners like me, 3 years into ownership, I highly recommend everyone to think about preventative replacement of 12v. \n\nThe cost is roughly $120 by Tesla. They do it as a mobile service. They will also likely do the wiring harness recall at the same time, which is the harder job of the two. \n\nThe upside is knowing your battery is good to go.\n\nThe downside of not doing this is as seen in the sub, car found dead, car stuck on the side of the road. \n\nNot everyone gets the warning messages. Don't rely on it. \n\nI tested my 12v before replacement, but because it was being charged by the HV battery, it always showed 13v on the multimeter. You can also access this info in the service menu. Under \"low voltage\" system. \n\nMy car had the symptom of severe vampire drain before changing the 12v. Losing about 1% an hour with sentry off, cabin overheat off, no api access, no checking in the app. \n\nI suspect this post will be deleted by mods but whatever. Its an important note that owners need to know.",

      "text": "We are excited to celebrate our one year anniversary of taking delivery of the Model 3, LR, AWD with 18\u001d aero wheels.  The car is beyond fun to drive and the car\u0019s feedback loop is continually making the car better.  Over the past year we have given demo rides to numerous friends, family members, co-workers, early adapters in our community and even some who have simply stopped to ask questions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq5ocjetbnf31.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d195b4fe9839bdc64575950d23b1d06d91cece60\n\nPeople often ask us about range anxiety and maintenance costs. To celebrate our experience we offer you our one year summary:\n\nWe took delivery on August 10th, 2018\n\nPut snow tires on at 6,800 miles (we live in a rural area)\n\nRotated snow tires at 13,000 miles\n\nPut summer tires back on 19,700 miles\n\nRotated summer tires at 27,000 miles.  We will replace our summer tires next spring when we take our snow tires off.\n\nFilled windshield washer fluid twice.\n\nChanged cabin air filter at 28,500 miles.  Note this was completed by Tesla\u0019s Mobile Service saving us a six-hour, round trip to our closest service center in Eden Prairie, MN at no extra cost!\n\nWe have washed our Model 3 more over one year\u0019s time than we had all our previous cars put together!\n\nNormally we charge at home at night using a NEMA 14-50 outdoor wall plug that uses off-peak power.  We love waking up to a car that\u0019s charged to meet our daily needs whether that is a 65% charge or 100% charge.  During the last year we have super charged 79 times for a total cost of $449.88. Our average cost per charge was $5.70 and our average super charging time has been 32 minutes.  We also used destination chargers at lodging facilities and two RV parks to charge in remote areas.\n\nDuring our trips, we used \u001cA Better Route Planner\u001d and loaded it into the car\u0019s computer to display on the screen.  We personalized the planning data based upon our current situation (average wh/mi, temperature, wind, road conditions). We set our lower battery arrival level at 20% to cover for unknown elevation changes and weather conditions (temperature, precipitation and wind).  Using their recommendations, we selected superchargers or destination chargers from the Tesla listings.  Most of our miles have been driven on Enhanced Autopilot.  \n\nOur lifetime wh/mile for the year is unknown but we started with TeslaFI on January 1st, 2019.  Since that time TeslaFI has tracked 17,350 miles with a 269 wh/mile average with our average temperature being 55 degrees F.  Over the same time period, our battery has degraded 2.4%  Since January, we have received 8 over the air updates averaging 22 days between each update.  \n\nOne of our most memorable experiences was while we were supercharging at the Flying J Travel Center in Fort Stockton, Texas.  A father came up with his twelve-year old son while we were eating in the Travel Center.  He asked if were were the owners of the Model 3.  It was the first one they\u0019d seen.  The son knew everything about the specs of the Model 3.  They both smiled as we showed them our car.  His son\u0019s knowledge, excitement and pure joy in witnessing an all-electric vehicle gave us hope for the future.\n\nThis photo was taken at Inspiration Point, located 2 miles west of Lanesboro, MN.",

      "title": "Why I Chose the Model 3 RWD over the Model 3 LR",
      "text": "Hello everyone, if you were wondering if you should go for the Long Range Model 3 or the RWD Model 3 like me, maybe you can benefit from my post. I live in Southern Ontario, and my daily commute is about 60 km round trip. My current car (old car) is (was) a 2013 Genesis Coupe. I have loved this car and I will miss the manual transmission, but it's time to move on and I cannot justify an ICE car. I have done a ton of research into the different trims of Model 3 and I have looked into buying used vs buying new as well. I have decided on buying a new 2023 Model 3 RWD. This was not an easy decision, but I have decided to go with the RWD over the LR for the following reasons:  \n1. **LFP Battery.** The biggest reason was the new LFP battery. Though less dense, it will last a lot longer and can be charged to 100p. I believe it's rated to go 750k km. Thats ALOT. I won't have to worry about degradation for the most part, and for me, that is my biggest concern with EVs. It affects resale value, anxiety, and range over time.  \n2. **Meets My Needs.** I don't need the extra 100 km. I don't need better audio. I don't need an extra 2 seconds shaved off my acceleration from stop. This car is already leaps and bounds better than my current car.  Acceleration from 30-60 is very similar across all trims too.   \n3. **Save 12k**. The price difference between the LR and RWD Model 3 is about 15% ish. I am financing the car, so that means less interest and smaller monthly payments. The interest rates now are already high, shaving the price down now makes a big difference over time. I'm already spending 400 a month on gas, and after down payments, my payment will be the same. Currently, federal rebates are 5k for both cars, so this isn't a factor. Ontario as of 2023 does not give cash rebates for EVs. \n\n4. **Lighter Car.** Only by 200 pounds ish, but still, better for cornering.  \n5. **White Seats.** In Canada, the LR did not have the white seat option. This a small factor, but still a factor.\n\n6. **Range**. The range is plenty good for my needs. Over time, the gap between the LR and the RWD will close when it comes to the max range due to degradation rates between NCA and LFP batteries. I plan on keeping this car for at least 5-6 years.\n\n7. **Winter.** Honestly, with winter tires, my Genesis was fine. This car will be fine too with winter tires. I have talked to a few people with the RWD that have had it in our Ontario winters, and they said it was fine. I was worried about the LFP battery in the winter, but I can deal with the estimated 300 km range in the winter. \n\n8. **I'm not into showing off**. I know I'm buying a Tesla, but I am buying the CHEAPEST Tesla. There is some comfort in that. \n\n9. **RWD M3 is the most efficient Tesla ever built. Nice.**   \n\n\nHope this helps anyone trying to decide.",

      "title": "Tesla's EV-Tax Credit Problem (Speculation on why they turned off M3 LR orders)",
      "text": "After thinking this through a bit, Tesla has an issue due to the M3 RWD using the CATL LFP packs. Since the battery is manufactured in China and the materials most likely come from countries that would disqualify it from the tax credit completely, They are in a strange position if they were to make the Model 3 LR priced at $55k for it to be eligible for the tax credit. \n\nIf they drop the price of the M3 LR, it would effectively cost $47500 to the customer while the M3 RWD would cost $47000 with no tax credit and sales would be extremely constrained.\n\nThe only way to solve this problem would be to sell through the CATL LFP packs and then come out with a RWD variant with 2170 cells that would qualify for the tax credit. This allows the customer to get the full benefit of the tax credit while Tesla keeps the profit with the costs being $47500 and $39500 respectively.\n\nTo solve this, the best solution is to simply not allow Model 3 LR orders and force anyone who wants a Model 3 to either pay a premium for the Performance (shortest wait time), or buy the RWD which will help them sell through these cells.\n\nI'm not buying the wait time/order back log comments. The wait time for the Model 3 LR with any upgrade before the shut down was November - Jan 2023. This is much less of a wait time than the Model Y LR which Tesla has no problem taking your order for.\n\nThis is totally speculation, but seems to make perfect sense given the potential issues of having the RWD not qualify for the tax credit and the LR qualify.",

      "text": "The other day I saw a message on my screen about my 12-volt battery needing service soon. I thought I might just change it myself because I don't mind doing that sort of thing but it turns out the battery is impossible to find.\n\nI made a service appointment using the phone application and it said The soonest I could get a mobile service technician would be in about a week. I went ahead and made the appointment.\n\nThe next day I received a text message from Tesla Mobile service offering an earlier repair date of Wednesday. I accepted the offer and was excited it would only take 3 days to get the appointment.\n\nin the meantime the car did act completely normal even though I had the message whenever I was driving.\n\nTesla mobile service showed up on time and replaced the battery in about 30 minutes. My car is under warranty and is only about a year old with about 17,000 miles. I haven't seen an invoice or anything but I don't expect to be charged.\n\nI asked the technician if this was common and he said not really. He said the battery actually tested pretty good at 12.3 volts but that the car had noticed it was needing to top the battery off more by the high voltage system. He said it is more frequent charges required by the 12-volt battery that triggers the message.\n\nI have never had any other car company come to my house to make a repair. Absolutely awesome. it normally requires one or more trips to the dealership to drop the car off arrange for a ride to work or home etc.",

      "text": "One week in, here are my thoughts\n\n1. Best car I have ever owned. Previous cars were BMW 335 and 525, which I loved&but this car is better in several ways. Drives better, rides better, better visibility.\n2. The turn signals are&super easy and intuitive. What\u0019s the fuss? SO EASY!!\n3. White interior is beautiful and easy to keep clean. As many other people have said, just keep a can of any kind of interior wipes on hand.\n4. I installed the Tesla wall charger the day before I picked the car up, I plug it in every day and keep the battery at 80% as per Tesla\u0018s recommendations. Just so easy.\n5. Fit, finish, and build quality are top notch. Literally zero rattles. I believe the driver door might be slightly misaligned due to a \u001ctapping\u001c noise it makes right when I close it, kind of like a \u001ctap-thunk\u001dinstead of just a \u001cthunk\u001d. I have a service appointment next week to have that looked at.\n6. After driving this for a week, and then driving my gas powered 335, the Bmw just feels& Stupid and old? Clunky, noisey, sluggish.\n7. Several days ago I had the fronts tinted with 50% ceramic, rear passengers and back glass at 35% ceramic, and sunroof with 20% ceramic. Initially I was afraid the sunroof was too dark, but then yesterday was very sunny with the sun directly overhead, and realized I\u0019m very happy with it. Plenty bright inside the car still but no excessive glare. Although I can\u0019t tell if the car heats up any slower, or if it heats up less, I can definitely tell that I do not feel the heat from the sun on my arms or on my head while I am in it.

      "text": "Made a 210 Mile round trip today in my M3P today.  I've done this drive many times on just 90% battery.  Typically arrive home with about 5-10% depending on how fast I drive.  I didn't think anything of it and today was not a typical day.  The drive is majority interstate and the supercharger on my stretch of the interstate was down temporarily so I had no backup.   There is also a major storm in the Southeastern US that I did not plan correctly for.  Arrived about 3 miles from my house with 1% left and the car just died on me and I was stranded on the side of the road.  I live more rural/small town so it is a little time consuming to get a tow, but I called AAA and they had someone to me within an hour.  \n\nMoral of the story, I need to plan better for non typical situations and not rely on the 0% buffer I so nonchalantly relied on in the past. I will from now on only plan for when I can charge either at my house or with a supercharger with at least 5% to save me a future headache.",

Power steering, brakes, screen, headlights and hazards were not working, so I had to coast on the highway at 1 am till it stopped on its own accord. I even had to pop the emergency exit on the door. Right now I\u0019m suspecting my 12v battery as I got a warning regarding it earlier in the day, but can that auxiliary battery cause this type of failure?\n\nEdit- the brakes did not fail, the power assistance and steering went out.\n\nEdit 2- it did end up being my 12v, and after changing it myself everything ended up working fine. The Tesla tech that I ended up picking up the battery from told me that it the screen should\u0019ve told me to pull over immediately and given me an emergency warning ahead of time, so I assume ethier my batteries failure was due to something\ncoming loose or breaking, or a glitch in the system of my Tesla.",

      "text": "**Customer service is always going to be the most important thing to me.** I don't blame Tesla for there being vehicle faults at all. These things happen, and they can happen at any given time to any product. However, Tesla seems to struggle in providing a \\*consistent\\* (key note: consistent) positive experience at the service level. There appears to be some positive experiences, but there appears to be \\*so many\\* poor experiences mixed in there.\n\nMy vehicle broke down on 10/31, and it's a 2022 M3P that I picked up in June. I absolutely love the car, but it was an unexpected fault that left me stranded for a few hours on Halloween. I wasn't really unhappy about that, as I understand that these things happen. I was patient as I waited for roadside service, and I've been patient throughout the repair process. Unfortunately, Tesla replaced the drive unit inverter, and now realize that they need to replace the entire drive unit or need another inverter. It's a little unclear, but they've advised that it could be weeks more before I have my car back. Again though -- that's not something I'll hold against them. If it were any other car, these things could and may happen.\n\nIt seems that I'm one of the lucky ones that got a loaner after 8 days of asking. I say I'm the lucky one because it seems most people don't seem to get one at all. They don't have an ETA right now but said it could be weeks before they have the part that they need. The lack of transparency is of course frustrating. The fact that the loaner, an M3 SR from 2019 was absolutely filthy was a bit frustrating. It was given to me with \\~20 miles on the battery, and it was just grossly unmaintained. The vehicle had caked on dirt, grime, garbage in the back, sand on the seats, and not a single surface had been wiped down (possibly ever, haha). I'm grateful for having a loaner -- I'm just not feeling that it was an appropriate way to provide one. A little extra care to clean the vehicle would've been the right thing to do, and would've shown some respect/understanding for the unfortunate situation.\n\nI really hope that Tesla is doing something to enhance the consistency of their customer service. As other manufacturers begin to produce viable alternatives, it becomes even more crucial for them to do so. Again -- when it's working, I \\*LOVE\\* the car... I've wanted a Tesla for over a decade, and I've defended the vehicle beyond the flaws/shortcomings. Even now as family members driving Toyotas tell me how absurd it is for a 65K vehicle to break down in 4 months, I brush it off... but it's a lot harder to brush off the feeling of under appreciation. Tesla needs to show some respect and appreciation for their customers, or they may not be lifelong customers.\n\nWe all deserve the very best from Tesla. I hope to see an improvement in their service in the future.",

I thought this would be perfect way to test the claim that the prices raises make supercharging more expensive in states where gas is cheap.  The articles cited Texas as a state with cheap gas.  To be fair, the Texas superchargers charge by the minute and not the kw/h, but the articles didn't give credit for this.  Testing done on a Model 3, LR AWD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left my house with 90% charge, and arrived at the first supercharger at about 45%.  I pay 13 cents a kw/h at home, so we will go with $4.39.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1st stop:  $5.94\n\n2nd stop:  $7.37\n\nLast stop:  $4.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrand Total:  $22.56\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got home with around 25% battery life.

      "text": "I recently rented an EV and was given a Polestar 2 (was originally supposed to be a Model Y).  Just wanted to throw out a little comparison to my Model 3 SR+.  \n\nPros: Ride quality is really good.  It is smooth and quiet.  Range was decent at \\~300 miles with a full charge.  This was the single motor long range version (82 KWH battery).  Carplay and SiriusXM were built in.  \n\nCons: Visibility is terrible.  The view from the rearview mirror is awful and you can only see a small sliver of back glass.  The front view is about like a normal sedan and not nearly as open as the M3.  The interface is no intuitive and hard to find basic settings.  Cruise control only works in increments of 5mph and temperature can only be set to even numbers.  There is a large hump in the rear middle seating area that makes is uncomfortable for anyone riding in that position.  The center console area is bulky and not well thought out.  Acceleration feels sluggish compared to the M3.  The quality of the interior seems cheap (cloth seats and easily scratched up plastic).  Quality/Resolution of the cameras is not great (definitely not high definition).  There is a 360 degree view, but it looks like crap.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall it was fine for driving for a few days for a rental, but man I missed by M3.  The tech and interface is leaps and bounds ahead of Polestar.  The price of the car is higher than the SR+ M3 and lacks many of the features that Tesla includes.  Polestar has a lot of work to do to catch up.  ",

      "text": "Hello everyone\n\nI though I'll share my experience as a TM3LR owner of six months.\n\nI am from Denmark so prices will be in DKK, distances in KM, dates in DD/MM/YYYY format.  \n100 DKK = 13,52 USD  \n100 DKK = 13,45 EUR  \n(rates of 19/08/2022)\n\nStarting with the ordering &amp; delivery\n\nI ordered my MSM LR 18aero on the 14/12, nothing special happened.  \nAt that time ETD window was May 2022.  \nI had the money for the downpayment, so no issues.  \nIt hasn't moved until 04/02.   \nAt that time it became 17/02 - 03/03. I though cool, 3 months earlier.\n\n15/02 - ETD moved to 21/02 - 04/03  \n22/02 - ETD moved to 25/02 - 07/03 - I could schedule delivery so the next day I did, contracts, invoices signed, car registered to my name, licenseplate etc. done.  \n23/02 - ETD moved to 02/03 - 02/03  \n28/02 - Tesla called me that there is some issue with the car and they cannot deliver on 02/03, so i need to reschedule so ETD 04/03  \n03/03 - Tesla called again, that the delivery for tomorrow is not gonna happen, the car cannot connect to mobile network, service is on it, and if i want to I can pick it up tomorrow, but there will be no mobile connection and ranger service will fix it. I said ok, I can hotspot my phone, no biggie.  \nLater that day I got called again, that I cannot take the car, since the mobile connection is needed for the SOS service, so it is considered a safety issue if it doesn't work. ETD 10/30  \n9/03 - ETD moved to 18/3 during the evening so I couldn't call Tesla.  \n10/03 - ETD moved to 11/3 (I don't even remember why...)  \n11/03 - ETD moved to 18/3, I had another MSM LR assigned to my account with 19´´ sport wheels. I called Tesla (Aarhus), they said that the issue with my car for not connecting to LTE is that it has a dead gsm module and they need spare parts, however, they found another MSM LR in another city (Odense), they will switch the wheels to the 18´´, and bring it to my home address so I don't have to go to the service center.  \n12/03 - after discussing the above details, delivery was scheduled to 15/03.  \n15/03 - I got my car. MIC TM3LR MSM 18aero\n\nThis was about the delivery experience. Not the best, but it doesn't really matter in retrospect, I still got my car 3 months earlier than initially expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuality of the car\n\nAt delivery, the car was perfect.  \nNo panelgaps, no scratches, no squeaky anything.  \nToday, after driving a total of 21000kms so far, only a few minor issues came up: the trunk lift motor/damper is moving in a bit of a wobbly way and depending on temperature, it creaks.  \nThe other is the front left suspension which gives out a thumping sound every now and then when I go over a speedbump. Both are going to be checked in two weeks.\n\nApart from these, all is still perfect.\n\nNo fogging of the taillights, no misaligned doors, no squeaking control arm, no sagging of seats. Nothing.  \nPaint has scratches - some are my fault for scrubbing dried seagull droppings too enthusiastically, some are from normal wear.  \nI have some tiny stonechips on the windshield - inevitable... I had one slighlty more concerning chip, but got fixed the next day at carglass - free of charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCost\n\nThe car itself of course is not the cheapest, but I bought it before the price spikes recently, so it was 460000DKK (+20k for the loan interest). As comparison, today with the same conditions it would be 505k +22k interest.\n\nRunning cost is cheap. I have a subscription for unlimited charging for 670DKK a month so charge is almost no cost (using supercharger only on roadtrips outside the nordics), especially when I carpool a colleague of mine, then it is almost 0DKK in a month.\n\nInsurance is a bit more than what I had with my previous car (Skoda Fabia 1,6TDI sportline), but not crazy expensive.\n\nEnvironmental tax is the lowest 600DKK/Year (my skoda was 3600/year)\n\nThat is for the upkeep, and then of course I bought some accessories for a total of 4600DKKThese were: Display swivel, knick ring, spoiler, jackpads, center tray, screen protector, matte black front emblem and tesla letters for the trunk, wheelcap set, black pedals and a intake vent protector.\n\nI pay for the convenience of the premium connectivity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsumption\n\nI keep track of two consumptions - one I call net, which is purely the consupmtion of driving and the gross, which is the total electricity consumed broken down to kilometers driven.Since I have sentry always running, I am also cooling the car whenever it gets warm, gross is ofc. higher.\n\nNet: 151,3 Wh/kmGross: 228,2 Wh/km\n\nSo far, compared to my previous car, I saved on fuel 12000DKK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter these 21000kms drive, I still think this is the best car I've owned. Ride is a bit rough, but that's a price you pay for a heavy EV in this pricerange, and not worse than the Skoda I had.  \nThe seats are comfortable even on long rides.Sound system is amazing.  \nCargo space is plenty, only the opening of the trunk makes it difficult sometimes.  \nI drive a lot on highway and now I couldn't imagine my daily commute without autopilot.   \nI have only the standard, but i can count on one of my hands the occasions of phantom slowings (not breaking, it never slammed on it so far)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand for the end, some pictures of charts and the car itself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There she is, on a roadtrip to Copenhagen](https://preview.redd.it/tqcxtf7hini91.jpg?width=1119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7fd214cc8def439363d1535a3e5dc0b9704533)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla-inspired stats for the total charing](https://preview.redd.it/ln5x4ygjini91.jpg?width=1304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d3de267fb3a19b310d52a83eb9ff3166d608e9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla-inspired stats for the last 31days of charging](https://preview.redd.it/ii9vfl93jni91.jpg?width=1303&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab72e7e422dbcb8cbf24bb85c490ec0b576e8ef0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monthly cost breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0inwmgwjini91.jpg?width=1308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa91dc8eb3feb6b55c0036cbbf3aba69337ae384)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More detailed cost and consumption breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/71snihakini91.jpg?width=1309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3755b16634fc2363cc1bb28bcf7c7c7dfcebd1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some battery degradation estimate](https://preview.redd.it/x0zi4kczkni91.jpg?width=1689&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d1b62fe5984bd26210929dc1964a7bd2a78a78)",

      "title": "my cross country drive: A supercharger summary",
      "text": "I recently traveled back from New York to Los Angeles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, 18\" Aero wheels (which I've named Marvin) after spending a couple months with my mom during the COVID-19 crisis.  I decided to head back home to LA since the restrictions are loosening in NY at the time of departure and my mom is getting along well.  I took minimal breaks and doing no sightseeing as I traverse the country, and figured I'd write up my experience for anyone interested.  I'll have summary statistics at the end with total distance, kWh used, efficiency, and total cost.  I'm happy to answer any questions about my trip!\n\n\ntl;dr: 4 days, 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86\n\n\nNight 0/Day 1 -\n\n\nStony Brook area to Ridgewood.  Stayed the night with family there, and did not charge that night.  I woke up around 8 AM and started out west from there.  My first charging stop was in Allentown, PA.  The drive was overall pleasant, through mostly suburban highways.  Most of the driving was 2 lane, very little traffic and autopilot worked flawlessly.  There was a $1 toll for one of the small bridges on my route.  I didn't calculate the total miles and efficiency, but the Ridgewood to Allentown portion was roughly 100 miles at 253 Wh/mi.\n\n\nAllentown supercharging spot:\n\n- Large strip mall.  There's a number of smaller eateries and a drive through fast food place, including a Jamba Juice that is great for breakfast smoothies.  8 stalls all of 150kW speed, I actually got around 120.  During my roughly 30 minutes there only 1 other car showed up.  Unfortunately, there's no obvious public restroom here.  Overall this stop is very clean and well maintained, but unremarkable.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 3.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility (ease to find from the highway): 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic Views: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal price: $14.31\n\n\nDrive to Somerset:\n\n210.3 miles, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- There were some really beautiful mountains and tunnels on the route from Allentown to Somerset.  The winding PA Turnpike through the Blue Ridge mountains was incredible, and rural PA is super pleasant to drive through.  Unfortunately there was a good bit of construction that brought it down to one lane with a 40 MPH speed limit, but due to light traffic this wasn't much of a problem.  Again, autopilot handled this very well, but I took over during the construction zones out of an abundance of caution.  There was a toll on the PA Turnpike, but I don't know how much it is yet due to bill by mail.\n\n\nSomerset, PA supercharging spot:\n\n- Right next to the highway.  The only eatery in the area is a Wendy's which seems to be the only spot with an accessible restroom; the charging spot is between a Verizon, the Wendy's, a car wash, and what I think is a dance studio?  I'm getting my advertised 120 kW of power, but of the 6 stalls I'm the only car here for the full half hour that I'm charging.  This station is well but not exceptionally maintained and clean, but not particularly great.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal price: $13.52\n\n\nDrive to Cambridge, OH:\n\n154.8mi, 236 Wh/mi\n\n- A very nice scenic drive through the forest of western Pennsylvania, the country (OK, interstate) roads of West Virginia, and eastern Ohio.  As soon as I left Somerset it started raining lightly, so I was slowed a bit by that.  I-70W was closed through Wheeling, WV so there was a small detour onto 470.  Autopilot did have a small issue in a construction zone where the old lane lines were still visible and there were diverging lines on the left, making the car think the lane was turning when it was staying straight.  Again, there was a small toll on the highway, but I don't know how much it was due to bill by mail.\n\nCambridge, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a Sheetz gas station less than a mile off the highway, with a traffic light to help you make the left heading back to the highway.  This serves as the primary eatery and restroom in the area; there is a Denny's next door about a 300 foot walk.  Bathroom is very clean, as is the parking lot.  Also in the strip mall here is a Dollar General which I guess you can pick up something if you need to.  Again, I am the only car here out of 8 stalls, pulling 125kW, but it dropped to 100 kW when about 60% charged.  Overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.64\n\n\nDrive to Cincinnati, OH:\n\n177.6 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- I wasn't sure if I was going to stop at this one or Columbus in between.  As I was driving into Columbus I saw that I would have a rated ~160 miles to get the ~100 miles further to Cincinnati, so I went for it and made it here with about 10% left on the battery.  As I entered Columbus and the scenery shifted from wooded to more open plains, the skies opened up as well with large heavy thunderstorms.  These caused autopilot to become unavailable with the \"Take control immediately\" message popping up.  The heavy rains dropped my efficiency pretty significantly for this leg of the journey so I had to slow down a bit to make it to Cincinnati with enough charge to be comfortable.  This was definitely the most strenuous but most enjoyable leg of the journey so far.  Driving through the rain was beautiful and I really felt in control.\n\nCincinnati, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a meijer supermarket parking lot.  It's about 2 miles off the highway with a number of turns and traffic lights to get to it, and the GPS took me in through the delivery/loading docks.  The spots for this charger are freshly paved in stark contrast with the rest of the lot.  Also in this parking lot is a Target, so there are probably accesible bathrooms.  Best place for food is going to be the meijer supermarket.  No garbage cans anywhere near the chargers.  For the charge itself, there's me and one other car charging in the 10 stalls and I started with pulling 120kW but that dropped throughout my charging session.  This is a fine enough location but a bit difficult to find/out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $7.15\n\n\nDrive to Louisville, KY:\n\n104.2 mi, 262 Wh/mi\n\n- Somehow Cincinnati was the first city that I actually drove through and not just around.  I got a good view of the baseball and football stadiums from the highway, and the roads were very manageable.  On the woodsy highway through Kentucky, I was surprised how many highway patrol cars I saw with their lights off in the shoulder after dusk.  I finally checked in to my hotel around 10PM after a very full day of driving.  My hotel is about 3 miles from the supercharging station and I forgot to track my actual distance and usage for this short bit.\n\nDay 2:\n\nLouisville supercharger:\n\n- Located at a college annex building's parking lot, the associated bakery has been sadly shut down.  The stalls are nice and well kept but I didn't note my actual power draw while there as I walked over to the bakery to find it closed instead.  There are no garbage cans in this lot, and there is a coffee shop in easy walking distance across the street.  The station is right off the highway and it's very easy to get back on.  There was 1 other car there out of the 8 stalls.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: ??/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.94\n\n\nDrive to Bowling Green, KY:\n\n113.5 mi, 271Wh/mi\n\n- Another rainy segment as the skies parted as I exited Louisville and closed again when I entered Bowling Green.  Mostly 3 lane highway, very easily navigable.\n\nBowling Green, KY supercharger:\n\n- Located at another meijer supermarket, this one is off to the side by a large field.  It's about 4 miles off from the highway, making it less accessible for road tripping purposes.  It's a very pleasant suburban drive down to the charger along relatively large county roads.  Other than the meijer, there are no shops or eateries in easy waling distance.  I'm the only car here of the 8 stalls, pulling between 100 and 115kW.  Overall it's a nice spot if a little out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 4/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Dickson, TN (West of Nashville):\n\n102.5 mi, 264Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped for lunch with a cousin in the suburbs.  Very easy pair of segments.  Nice transition into mountainy roads, beautiful scenery and view of the Nashville skyline on the way.\n\nDickson, TN supercharger:\n\n- At a Holiday Inn Express, 2B appears damaged like someone backed into it.  I'm the only car here at the 8 chargers getting 130 kW.  There's a restaurant nearby in walking distance.  No nearby trash can.  Easy to get here from the highway.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Jackson, TN:\n\n94.6mi, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- Nothing special, but very pleasant.  Good wooded road well paved and fast moving.\n\nJackson, TN supercharger:\n\n- By far the nicest supercharging spot that I've been to so far on this trip.  Unfortunately, the spot is a bit awkward to get to from I-40W as the exit takes you one way and you need to take a U-turn on a surface street.  Luckily, that side street goes by a number of drive-throughs and I got my guilty pleasure that's only a southern thing - Cookout.  Had I not, I would have gotten to eat at the general store, a traditional bakery and had time to explore a small gift shop and train museum, or even play a round of mini-golf (were it not closed due to the pandemic).  There was a classic Pullman car directly in front of the chargers and this was a really cool atmosphere.  I highly recommend a stop off here even if it's just to top off.  I didn't pay attention to my charging speed, but it was plenty fast.  I was the only car of 8 stalls.  There are also a few Blink chargers installed next to the Tesla ones.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: ?/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.52\n\n\nDrive to Memphis, TN:\n\n74.9mi, 267 Wh/mi\n\n- Another wooded segment very similar to the last.  Unfortunately due to the turn off onto I-240 I didn't really get a good view of the Memphis skyline, but that's fine.\n\nMemphis, TN supercharger:\n\n- In a strip mall next to a free standing First Horizon bank.  Good accessibility from the highway and a number of eateries in the area.  Not sure where would be a good bathroom here, but the Taco Bell nearby could be a nice option.  Very clean but no garbage cans near the chargers. I'm one of 2 cars here and I'm pulling around 90kW, the slowest charge I've had all trip.  Nothing special, a little slow, but you can't go wrong here.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.89\n\n\nDrive to Little Rock, AR:\n\n168.5mi, 245 Wh/mi\n\n- I took a small detour to see the exterior of Graceland on my way out of Memphis; it was cool but not too exciting from the outside.  The landscape opened up a bit from the wooded background to more of a mix of farmland and wooded areas.  Nice view of Little Rock going through the city.  The highway had very little construction throughout my drive, and the only traffic I experienced was due to an accident in Memphis itself.\n\nLittle Rock, AR supercharger:\n\n- This one is in an outlet center between the mall, a Hooters and a movie theater.  The view here is also pretty nice with flower beds and excellent landscaping all around.  It's very close to the highway, though the GPS took me off an exit too early.  Very easy to get back onto the highway.  No garbage can right at the chargers, but there are plenty in the mall itself.  I'm one of 2 cars here in the 10 spots, pulling around 140 kW.  Overall, it's a really nice place for a stop off.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 4.5/5\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.08\n\n\nDrive to Texarkana, TX:\n\n135.3 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!  Once again a heavy thunderstorm restricted my ability to use autopilot for a good stretch of the drive.  I had to take over manually for a while, and even when cruise control returned the auto lane change was disabled.  The bolts of lightning across the sky made for an incredible backdrop\n\nTexarkana, TX supercharger:\n\n- At an Olive Garden on the outskirts of a mall.  It's right up against a one-way highway service road, and if you miss the turn off into the parking lot then it's a long way back.  If you're not from Texas, navigating the service roads can be tricky.  I missed a right turn ramp to make a U-turn which added 2 miles to my trip from the exit ramp to the charger.  Definitely confusing if it's your first time here and coming in on I-30W.  The station itself is nice enough.  I'm the only car here of 8 spots and I'm getting roughly 135 kW.  Seems well maintained, but finding it was a little bit of an issue.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nDrive to Sulphur Springs, TX:\n\n97.5 mi, 299 Wh/mi\n\n- The speed limit jumped up to 75 for almost the entirety of this stretch, which really drove down my efficiency as I set cruise control to 82 MPH for almost the entirety of the stretch.  I saw a few ranches along the way and a couple really huge churches.  Really easy drive.\n\nSulphur Springs, TX supercharger:\n\n- In a stand-alone parking lot next to a police station.  To get here from the highway, there's a quick turn off ramp that you'll need to cross a couple lanes within 500 feet of the highway exit to make the right.  To get to the charger, it's about a 2 mile scenic drive through a residential neighborhood and a classic American small town main street that I would love to come back to visit.  The Tesla spots are a nice brick paving, and well maintained.  Of the 8 spots, I'm the only car here and pulling 140 kW.  Definitely a great location to park and walk around in.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Arlington, TX:\n\n95.8 mi, 268 Wh/mi\n\n- A transition from the 2-lane highway of rural Texas to the 5+ lane highways of the Dallas metroplex.  Were it not for a thick fog and persistent rain, I would have gotten a great view of the Dallas skyline.  But coming off the highway I got a great view of Six Flags, and it really put in perspective how much taller Titan is than the New Texas Giant (both great rides from prior experience)\n\nArlington, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located behind the e-sports arena, very easy to get here from the highway - less than a mile off of it.  It's got great views of AT&amp;T stadium, Globe Life Ballpark, and a bit of the Six Flags park, with well manicured lawns surrounding this portion of the parking lot; it overlooks a small pond.  I'm not sure how accessible this would be on a game day, but at 10AM on a Saturday with no events it's plenty available.  10 stalls here, and it's me plus one other car.  I'm drawing 100 kW from this very central to activities location.  It doesn't look like there are any food or bathroom options around, but there is a nerby trash can.  If you're looking to get something to eat, use a different charger.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5 (But I can see this being a huge issue if there's a Rangers game)\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.29\n\n\nDrive to Cisco, TX:\n\n121.6 mi, 353 Wh/mi\n\n- Pouring rain until about 5 miles outside Cisco, so no autopilot this entire leg.  Nice open plains once I got further out from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nCisco, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Flying J / Shell gas station with a Denny's.  In addition to the 8 supercharger outets, there's a single J-1772 that appears to be free (I didn't check if it worked).  Bathrooms insude the gas tation, and there are windshield cleaners in the gas station area.  There's also a small outdoor seating area here.  Very easy highway on/off, and a well maintained area.  I'm the only car here, puling arorund 130 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Sweetwater, TX:\n\n86.4 mi, 303 Wh/mi\n\n- I thought this leg was thoroughly uneventful, but it seems as though I got splashed by a huge mud pile on my driver side, so I'll have to find a car wash.  Didn't notice this while driving, just when I got out of the car for a delicious steak fries lunch at a local eatery before charging.\n\nSweetwater, TX supercharger:\n\n- Back behind a Holiday Inn express.  2 other cars out of 8 spots here when I got here, and I'm around 90 kW.  A couple guys rode in on their single wheel electric skateboard type things (sorry, I don't know what they're called), so that was exciting enough.  Garbage can present and the hotel has usable bathrooms.  Fine enough, but nothing great.  No food in walking distance.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.40\n\n\nDrive to Midland, TX:\n\n113.5 mi, 276 Wh/mi\n\n0 This leg was pretty cool to see.  There were a number of oil fields along the way as well as some processing plants.  With that, there was a lot of wide open road and open big country views.  I was just disappointed by about 10 miles straight of road work that was stripped to textured pavement giving a loud, bumpy ride.\n\nMidland, TX supercharger:\n\n- At the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel next door to a Love's gas station.  The souveniers in the Love's shop are pretty cool and very \"Texas.\"  It's right off the highway with easy on and easy off, and not too hard to find.  There's some food in the gas station, but nothing great.  There's a nearby garbage can and the view is pretty meh.  Clean.  I'm the only car here of the 8 spots, drawing around 140 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Pecos, TX:\n\n90.1 mi, 259 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful mountain shaddows in the backdrop.  Wide open road and the speed limit goes up to 80.  I'm surprised how good the efficiency I got was given the speed I was going, and how my AC is going strong (it's 94 F outside with a hot sun up above).\n\nPecos, TX supercharger:\n\n- Extremely easy to get to and very easy to find.  Right off the service road at a Flying J next to the Travelodge.  The travelodge has a nice little gazebo to sit at right next to the chargers.  Good size convenience store in the Flying J with available trash cans and restrooms.  8 chargers here and I'm the only car.  I'm ulling around 130 kW so a pretty good speed of charge.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $1.26\n\n\nDrive to Van Horn, TX:\n\n90.2 mi, 311 Wh/mi\n\n- Mostly wild flowers and small bushes.  My windshield has unfortunately become an insect graveyard.  Super easy drive.  Transition to plateaus is beautiful.\n\nVan Horn, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Hampton Inn.  Only amenity is bathrooms, and there is nothing in easy walking distance of this Hampton Inn.  This stop is very easy to get to from the highway and it's simple to get back on.  Views of the mountains are pretty nice from here with a lot of open space.  I'm the only car here right now, and unfortunately I'm only pulling between 30 and 60 kW (at 4A) so I may be here for a little while before heading to my next leg.  No outdoor garbage can, but it looks like someone left just a bag of trash by the big charger box.  This is probably one of the bottom few stations that I've visited on my trip.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 1/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.27\n\n\nDrive to El Paso, TX:\n\n131.1 mi, 272 Wh/mi\n\n- The drive through El Paso is pretty interesting, and the mountain backgrounds and surroundings on the way in look really nice.  You can get a good look at Ciudad Juarez as well as you're driving in.  I have somehow spent all sunlight today in Texas despite driving West and leaving at 7AM central, along with having no traffic.\n\nEl Paso, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at Rudy's Bar-B-Q (and not the Hampton Inn behind it).  Very easy highway access.  Because I missed my turn in I learned there's a touchless automatic car wash about a half block west of it, and after the long drive today my front windshield had become a Jackson Pollock painting of fly caracasses I decided to give it a go.  Sadly, the right hand side of the machine was broken so I don't recommend using this place.  When I got here, there were 2 other Teslas taking up chargers plus one charger that was ICEd with the family having a picnic in the charging spot next to their truck.  I'm starting to see a few more Teslas now as I'm going west.  The facilities here look pretty fine and well maintained.  Despite sharing 4A/4B (I wasn't going to park next to the truck) I'm still pulling 120 kW.  This is certainly a good spot to stop at, even if it's not pretty and there's no greenery.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.08\n\n\nDrive to Deming, NM:\n\n91.6 mi, 289 Wh/mi\n\n- It was dark out but the drive was easy.  I went through a border control checkpoint to the west of Las Cruces which was really simple.  Now, for sleep after charging.\n\nDeming, NM supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Valero gas station.  8 chargers and I'm the only car here.  Roughly 130 kW of power.  The chargers are off to the side of the building and while they're easy to find the area is poorly lit.  The Valero likely has a \npretty good selection and bathroom, but I didn't go in.  Garbage can is present.  The stop is about 1 mile north of the highway.  No real green space to walk around, but a couple cute cacti around the gas station.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.04\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nDrive to Wilcox, AZ:\n\n139.4 mi, 274 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful desertscapes.  Easy drive.  Smooth highway.  After charging the previous night, I had to backtrack a little bit to get to my hotel.\n\nWilcox, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Holiday Inn Express less than a mile from the highway.  Pretty ugly area; next to a large truck parking area.  Garbage can and bathrooms available within the hotel.  8 stalls, and only me + 1 other car, I'm getting around 120 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.52\n\n\nDrive to Casa Grande, AZ:\n\n146.5 mi, 232 Wh/mi\n\n- I absolutely love the desert landscape with the amazing natural rock formations.  This was my favorite set of scenery to drive through so far.  Except for the drive next to Tucson.  Tucson is really ugly from the highway.  There were also a couple instances where the autopilot detected me on the service road thinking the speed limit was way lower than it actually was and causing me to basically brake check myself.  Other than that, it was a pretty smooth drive.\n\nCasa Grande, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located behind a Chase bank in a strip mall.  There's a good set of food options here and the area is well maintained.  3 cars here now with 8 spots and I'm getting 110 kW.  Very easy to find from the highway and exceptionally easy \non/off.  Nicely manicured rockscape around, but unfortunely the chargers are parked such that you're facing into an active roadway/alleyway (this is basically a driveway onto it) where cars are flying down.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $2.50\n\n\nDrive to Buckeye, AZ:\n\n84.6 mi, 226 Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped in Phoenix on the way to do a quick socially-distanced walk through a park with an old friend, otherwise I would have driven around Phoenix and not through it.  But this did give me some nice views of the city's skyline.  Otherwise this segment is plenty pleasant with more of the manicured desert views.  However, Hank Hill said it best.  \"Phoenix is a testament to man's hubris.\"\n\nBuckeye, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Great location just off the highway in a small strip mall at a Carl's Jr.  There's plenty of food options and bathrooms here, and there's extremely easy highway access.  3 cars here including me at the 8 charging spots, and I'm getting roughly 110 kW.  The mall did a fine job on the landscaping but nothing too exciting.  I'll probably make a stop here each time I travel to Phoenix as it's pleasant and on my way.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 4.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Ehrenberg, AZ:\n\n116.9 mi, 291 Wh/mi\n\n- Nice desertscape with a few mountains.  Easy drive.  Very boring.  Almost back to CA!\n\nEhrenberg, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Very easy to get to via a roundabout.  Located between a Best Western and a Flying J that has a Wendy's.  A little bit of open green space in front of the chargers, but there's a giant gas tank on it and a weird smell here.  There are 8 chargers here, and I'm one of 3 Teslas plus 1 ICE here.  For about half a minute I was drawing the full rated 250 kW, but I've settled down around 170 for most of my charging session.  Definitely stop here instead of the Quartzsite location - they're about 15 miles apart on the same highway, but this one offers so much more.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.89\n\n\nDrive to Cabazon, CA:\n\n140.4 mi, 296 Wh/mi\n\n- I've done the later portion of this many times as I visit Palm Desert a few times a year.  The drive through the windmills is really cool.  Nice drive, open highway, this area always reminds me of home.\n\nCabazon, CA supercharger:\n\n- Located in an outlet mall with a really good variety of shops.  Right behind a McDonalds at one end of the outlets, these are all pull-forward stalls, with over a dozen available stalls, but I have had to wait for one due to heavy traffic here in the past.  There's a lot of trash all around here with a dumpster between a couple stations.  Very easy on/off.  One thing different about the CA superchargers - you pay by the kW, not by the minute leading to a much higher total price for supercharging, almost double the rate at other chargers around the country.  I'm getting a consistent 110 kW here.\n\nCleanliness: 2/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $9.24\n\n\nDrive to home:\n\n114.8 mi, 215 Wh/mi\n\n- I live in the San Fernando Valley, so I navigate on autopilot through a variety of freeway interchanges until I am finally home.  This has been an incredible road trip, I just wish it were under better circumstances.  I'm still shocked how easy this was to do and hope my experience can help others as they plan massive trips - it can certainly be done in an EV!\n\nDay 1: 746.9 mi, 257.5 Wh/mi\n\nDay 2: 689.3 mi, 262.1 Wh/mi\n\nDay 3: 917.8 mi, 292.8 Wh/mi\n\nDay 4: 742.6 mi, 258.0 Wh/mi\n\nTotal: 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86",

What time should I start charing my car to have the cheapest charge rate, Did I precondition my car enough when its cold outside, etc\n\nIs there a learning curve to knowing all of this and does it eventually get easier where you just plug in at home and forget? Or do you find yourself always checking your car's status?\n\nAs a comparison, with an ICE car, obviously, you fill it up, and you're done.

      "title": "How to use the energy \u001cTrip\u001d display.",
      "text": "I see a number of posts , especially with, new Tesla owners having anxiety about being able to reach their destination. Most of the responses say to use a better route planner (ABetterRoutePlanner.com), which is good and fine, but for me it seems like an unnecessary complication and personally just another software step to keep track of. You have a perfectly good navigation tool built into your Tesla when you learn how to use it properly. \n\nI am writing this to help the new owners make better use of the built in tools the car comes with and to reduce the range anxiety some of you have. New owners make use of the little battery symbol with either the milage or percentage left, to gauge, how far they can go. That\u0019s the worst way to figure out whether you will reach your destination without running out of battery storage. \n\nIf you want to figure out whether your Tesla can reach your destination, don\u0019t just guess, let the navigation system and \u001cTrip\u001d energy display help figure it out for you. Use the navigation system at all times when traveling any substantial distance or when you\u0019re not sure the Tesla will reach the destination. Entering the destination into your navigation system will do several things to help you get there:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. It will tell you if you can make the destination on your current charge level. \n2. It will route you through a supercharger if needed. \n3. It will tell you the percentage estimate of charge left at the end of the trip.\n4. It will tell if you can make the return trip  at the bottom of the navigation menu. That way you can see if you have enough charge for the whole round trip.\n\nIn addition, use the energy screen to show the progress on your trip. Use the \u001cTrip\u001d display setting to show you how well you are doing. The \u001cTrip\u001d setting can only be used after you have put in a destination into the navigator system. \n\nSee image 1 as an example of a trip I took. The trip display shows you two lines in the graph. The grey one shows you the predicted energy usage for the whole trip. The green line shows your actual energy usage as you drive the route. At the beginning of the trip the lines will be on top of each other, making it look like one line. The end point will show the predicted charge left at the end of the trip. But as you drive it will show what energy you will actually end up with. The location of the car shows how much energy you have right now. The slope of the line shows how much energy is being used at any particular moment on the trip. A higher energy usage will have a steeper downward slope of the line. That happens when going up a hill or going much faster than the predicted speed. A flatter line shows less energy usage, which usually happens when going down a hill. With a long decent it can even go slightly up. It means that you are gaining energy. (This never happens in an ICE.) \n\nThe predicted grey line takes into account the altitude changes on the road and the speed limit of the road. The actual energy usage green line will be below the predicted energy usage line when you use more energy to get to the destination than the prediction. It might be because you are going too fast or you have a strong headwind, or maybe it\u0019s cold out and you\u0019re using the heater more. The solution would be too slow down or reduce your heating. \n\nWhen you use navigation the Tesla also tells you when you are getting low and directs you to a supercharger in range. If you ignore the Tesla information then you could run out and it tells you that also when you can\u0019t reach a supercharger from your current location. It also tells you to slow down to a specific speed if it thinks you will not make it to your destination at the speed you are going. It will recommend the speed to travel at. It cannot do that if you have not entered a destination into the navigation system, because it does not know where you are going.. So always enter a navigation destination when you are not sure whether you can reach the destination, even when you know the route by heart.\n\nImage 1 shows the trip from Salt Lake supercharger to Beaver in Utah. Speeds were pretty high some at 80 to 85 mph. Earlier in the trip I was going the speed limit, pretty much but noticed I was doing better than calculated so I went faster which narrowed the actual to the predicted energy usage. You can do that when you know from the \u001cTrip\u0019 graph what your usage is. It shows you your Tesla position as you are traveling and always shows the percentage charge left at the end for the predicted and actual as you get closer to your destination. The photo was taken at the end of the trip.\n\nImage 2 shows a shorter hilly terrain trip. It also has the trip view enhanced to show exaggerated difference between actual and estimated usage. You do that by pushing the plus sign on the top right of the trip energy display. Note that in some parts the energy usage lines go up for quite a bit, meaning the route was going down hill, gaining energy. Also note that the car estimated that I could do a lot better, except I was driving, uh, let\u0019s say a little spirited on the winding road, faster and more aggressive than I should have. But what the heck I was still getting 168 Wh/mi or about 200 MPGe relative to an ICE car.\n\nWhen you use navigation to help you with your trip energy consumption and the route it suggests is not the road you want to drive, for example, you want to take a scenic route, don\u0019t worry about it. Just take the road that you want to take. The navigation system will recalculate the route to the destination from the new road you are on and do the energy recalculation on the trip energy display. That way you will always know whether the charge in your battery is enough to reach your destination. \n\n[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/amukp86hbj151.jpg?width=2348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e94d92ef6618214f7990ef3cf63e59c51eb4b00)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Image 2](https://preview.redd.it/rv0xdh4jbj151.jpg?width=767&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138c4f1d016b9cd093b6850588dcf9720a18b90a)",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nThis morning I woke up to go to work and my car was not unlocking. I tried phone key, app, and keycard, nothing worked to open the doors. The headlights and brake lights would turn on when I click the unlock button in the app or touch the handles, but it wouldn't unlock.\n\nI thought it was the 12v, but Tesla customer service said the car has been asleep for 13 hours and there were no errors to indicate it's the 12v battery. Even if it was the 12v, I'm not sure how I could replace it if it's under the backseat and I can't get inside the car.\n\nI scheduled service but they can't come until Monday and I'm also out of warranty. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Any idea how to get inside the car to replace the 12v battery assuming that's the issue? Thank you!\n\nEdit: thanks for all the help! It was the 12v battery. New one from Tesla service center cost me $95, I was able to replace it myself by using a jump starter I got from Walmart to open the Frunk and turn on the car to unlock the doors and get inside. I have a 2021 M3P btw.\n\nEdit 2: in case it happens to anyone else, the Frunk can't be opened using the cables from tow hole using a battery charger, it has to be a jump starter.",

      "title": "my cross country drive: A supercharger summary",
      "text": "I recently traveled back from New York to Los Angeles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, 18\" Aero wheels (which I've named Marvin) after spending a couple months with my mom during the COVID-19 crisis.  I decided to head back home to LA since the restrictions are loosening in NY at the time of departure and my mom is getting along well.  I took minimal breaks and doing no sightseeing as I traverse the country, and figured I'd write up my experience for anyone interested.  I'll have summary statistics at the end with total distance, kWh used, efficiency, and total cost.  I'm happy to answer any questions about my trip!\n\n\ntl;dr: 4 days, 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86\n\n\nNight 0/Day 1 -\n\n\nStony Brook area to Ridgewood.  Stayed the night with family there, and did not charge that night.  I woke up around 8 AM and started out west from there.  My first charging stop was in Allentown, PA.  The drive was overall pleasant, through mostly suburban highways.  Most of the driving was 2 lane, very little traffic and autopilot worked flawlessly.  There was a $1 toll for one of the small bridges on my route.  I didn't calculate the total miles and efficiency, but the Ridgewood to Allentown portion was roughly 100 miles at 253 Wh/mi.\n\n\nAllentown supercharging spot:\n\n- Large strip mall.  There's a number of smaller eateries and a drive through fast food place, including a Jamba Juice that is great for breakfast smoothies.  8 stalls all of 150kW speed, I actually got around 120.  During my roughly 30 minutes there only 1 other car showed up.  Unfortunately, there's no obvious public restroom here.  Overall this stop is very clean and well maintained, but unremarkable.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 3.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility (ease to find from the highway): 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic Views: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal price: $14.31\n\n\nDrive to Somerset:\n\n210.3 miles, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- There were some really beautiful mountains and tunnels on the route from Allentown to Somerset.  The winding PA Turnpike through the Blue Ridge mountains was incredible, and rural PA is super pleasant to drive through.  Unfortunately there was a good bit of construction that brought it down to one lane with a 40 MPH speed limit, but due to light traffic this wasn't much of a problem.  Again, autopilot handled this very well, but I took over during the construction zones out of an abundance of caution.  There was a toll on the PA Turnpike, but I don't know how much it is yet due to bill by mail.\n\n\nSomerset, PA supercharging spot:\n\n- Right next to the highway.  The only eatery in the area is a Wendy's which seems to be the only spot with an accessible restroom; the charging spot is between a Verizon, the Wendy's, a car wash, and what I think is a dance studio?  I'm getting my advertised 120 kW of power, but of the 6 stalls I'm the only car here for the full half hour that I'm charging.  This station is well but not exceptionally maintained and clean, but not particularly great.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal price: $13.52\n\n\nDrive to Cambridge, OH:\n\n154.8mi, 236 Wh/mi\n\n- A very nice scenic drive through the forest of western Pennsylvania, the country (OK, interstate) roads of West Virginia, and eastern Ohio.  As soon as I left Somerset it started raining lightly, so I was slowed a bit by that.  I-70W was closed through Wheeling, WV so there was a small detour onto 470.  Autopilot did have a small issue in a construction zone where the old lane lines were still visible and there were diverging lines on the left, making the car think the lane was turning when it was staying straight.  Again, there was a small toll on the highway, but I don't know how much it was due to bill by mail.\n\nCambridge, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a Sheetz gas station less than a mile off the highway, with a traffic light to help you make the left heading back to the highway.  This serves as the primary eatery and restroom in the area; there is a Denny's next door about a 300 foot walk.  Bathroom is very clean, as is the parking lot.  Also in the strip mall here is a Dollar General which I guess you can pick up something if you need to.  Again, I am the only car here out of 8 stalls, pulling 125kW, but it dropped to 100 kW when about 60% charged.  Overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.64\n\n\nDrive to Cincinnati, OH:\n\n177.6 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- I wasn't sure if I was going to stop at this one or Columbus in between.  As I was driving into Columbus I saw that I would have a rated ~160 miles to get the ~100 miles further to Cincinnati, so I went for it and made it here with about 10% left on the battery.  As I entered Columbus and the scenery shifted from wooded to more open plains, the skies opened up as well with large heavy thunderstorms.  These caused autopilot to become unavailable with the \"Take control immediately\" message popping up.  The heavy rains dropped my efficiency pretty significantly for this leg of the journey so I had to slow down a bit to make it to Cincinnati with enough charge to be comfortable.  This was definitely the most strenuous but most enjoyable leg of the journey so far.  Driving through the rain was beautiful and I really felt in control.\n\nCincinnati, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a meijer supermarket parking lot.  It's about 2 miles off the highway with a number of turns and traffic lights to get to it, and the GPS took me in through the delivery/loading docks.  The spots for this charger are freshly paved in stark contrast with the rest of the lot.  Also in this parking lot is a Target, so there are probably accesible bathrooms.  Best place for food is going to be the meijer supermarket.  No garbage cans anywhere near the chargers.  For the charge itself, there's me and one other car charging in the 10 stalls and I started with pulling 120kW but that dropped throughout my charging session.  This is a fine enough location but a bit difficult to find/out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $7.15\n\n\nDrive to Louisville, KY:\n\n104.2 mi, 262 Wh/mi\n\n- Somehow Cincinnati was the first city that I actually drove through and not just around.  I got a good view of the baseball and football stadiums from the highway, and the roads were very manageable.  On the woodsy highway through Kentucky, I was surprised how many highway patrol cars I saw with their lights off in the shoulder after dusk.  I finally checked in to my hotel around 10PM after a very full day of driving.  My hotel is about 3 miles from the supercharging station and I forgot to track my actual distance and usage for this short bit.\n\nDay 2:\n\nLouisville supercharger:\n\n- Located at a college annex building's parking lot, the associated bakery has been sadly shut down.  The stalls are nice and well kept but I didn't note my actual power draw while there as I walked over to the bakery to find it closed instead.  There are no garbage cans in this lot, and there is a coffee shop in easy walking distance across the street.  The station is right off the highway and it's very easy to get back on.  There was 1 other car there out of the 8 stalls.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: ??/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.94\n\n\nDrive to Bowling Green, KY:\n\n113.5 mi, 271Wh/mi\n\n- Another rainy segment as the skies parted as I exited Louisville and closed again when I entered Bowling Green.  Mostly 3 lane highway, very easily navigable.\n\nBowling Green, KY supercharger:\n\n- Located at another meijer supermarket, this one is off to the side by a large field.  It's about 4 miles off from the highway, making it less accessible for road tripping purposes.  It's a very pleasant suburban drive down to the charger along relatively large county roads.  Other than the meijer, there are no shops or eateries in easy waling distance.  I'm the only car here of the 8 stalls, pulling between 100 and 115kW.  Overall it's a nice spot if a little out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 4/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Dickson, TN (West of Nashville):\n\n102.5 mi, 264Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped for lunch with a cousin in the suburbs.  Very easy pair of segments.  Nice transition into mountainy roads, beautiful scenery and view of the Nashville skyline on the way.\n\nDickson, TN supercharger:\n\n- At a Holiday Inn Express, 2B appears damaged like someone backed into it.  I'm the only car here at the 8 chargers getting 130 kW.  There's a restaurant nearby in walking distance.  No nearby trash can.  Easy to get here from the highway.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Jackson, TN:\n\n94.6mi, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- Nothing special, but very pleasant.  Good wooded road well paved and fast moving.\n\nJackson, TN supercharger:\n\n- By far the nicest supercharging spot that I've been to so far on this trip.  Unfortunately, the spot is a bit awkward to get to from I-40W as the exit takes you one way and you need to take a U-turn on a surface street.  Luckily, that side street goes by a number of drive-throughs and I got my guilty pleasure that's only a southern thing - Cookout.  Had I not, I would have gotten to eat at the general store, a traditional bakery and had time to explore a small gift shop and train museum, or even play a round of mini-golf (were it not closed due to the pandemic).  There was a classic Pullman car directly in front of the chargers and this was a really cool atmosphere.  I highly recommend a stop off here even if it's just to top off.  I didn't pay attention to my charging speed, but it was plenty fast.  I was the only car of 8 stalls.  There are also a few Blink chargers installed next to the Tesla ones.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: ?/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.52\n\n\nDrive to Memphis, TN:\n\n74.9mi, 267 Wh/mi\n\n- Another wooded segment very similar to the last.  Unfortunately due to the turn off onto I-240 I didn't really get a good view of the Memphis skyline, but that's fine.\n\nMemphis, TN supercharger:\n\n- In a strip mall next to a free standing First Horizon bank.  Good accessibility from the highway and a number of eateries in the area.  Not sure where would be a good bathroom here, but the Taco Bell nearby could be a nice option.  Very clean but no garbage cans near the chargers. I'm one of 2 cars here and I'm pulling around 90kW, the slowest charge I've had all trip.  Nothing special, a little slow, but you can't go wrong here.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.89\n\n\nDrive to Little Rock, AR:\n\n168.5mi, 245 Wh/mi\n\n- I took a small detour to see the exterior of Graceland on my way out of Memphis; it was cool but not too exciting from the outside.  The landscape opened up a bit from the wooded background to more of a mix of farmland and wooded areas.  Nice view of Little Rock going through the city.  The highway had very little construction throughout my drive, and the only traffic I experienced was due to an accident in Memphis itself.\n\nLittle Rock, AR supercharger:\n\n- This one is in an outlet center between the mall, a Hooters and a movie theater.  The view here is also pretty nice with flower beds and excellent landscaping all around.  It's very close to the highway, though the GPS took me off an exit too early.  Very easy to get back onto the highway.  No garbage can right at the chargers, but there are plenty in the mall itself.  I'm one of 2 cars here in the 10 spots, pulling around 140 kW.  Overall, it's a really nice place for a stop off.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 4.5/5\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.08\n\n\nDrive to Texarkana, TX:\n\n135.3 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!  Once again a heavy thunderstorm restricted my ability to use autopilot for a good stretch of the drive.  I had to take over manually for a while, and even when cruise control returned the auto lane change was disabled.  The bolts of lightning across the sky made for an incredible backdrop\n\nTexarkana, TX supercharger:\n\n- At an Olive Garden on the outskirts of a mall.  It's right up against a one-way highway service road, and if you miss the turn off into the parking lot then it's a long way back.  If you're not from Texas, navigating the service roads can be tricky.  I missed a right turn ramp to make a U-turn which added 2 miles to my trip from the exit ramp to the charger.  Definitely confusing if it's your first time here and coming in on I-30W.  The station itself is nice enough.  I'm the only car here of 8 spots and I'm getting roughly 135 kW.  Seems well maintained, but finding it was a little bit of an issue.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nDrive to Sulphur Springs, TX:\n\n97.5 mi, 299 Wh/mi\n\n- The speed limit jumped up to 75 for almost the entirety of this stretch, which really drove down my efficiency as I set cruise control to 82 MPH for almost the entirety of the stretch.  I saw a few ranches along the way and a couple really huge churches.  Really easy drive.\n\nSulphur Springs, TX supercharger:\n\n- In a stand-alone parking lot next to a police station.  To get here from the highway, there's a quick turn off ramp that you'll need to cross a couple lanes within 500 feet of the highway exit to make the right.  To get to the charger, it's about a 2 mile scenic drive through a residential neighborhood and a classic American small town main street that I would love to come back to visit.  The Tesla spots are a nice brick paving, and well maintained.  Of the 8 spots, I'm the only car here and pulling 140 kW.  Definitely a great location to park and walk around in.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Arlington, TX:\n\n95.8 mi, 268 Wh/mi\n\n- A transition from the 2-lane highway of rural Texas to the 5+ lane highways of the Dallas metroplex.  Were it not for a thick fog and persistent rain, I would have gotten a great view of the Dallas skyline.  But coming off the highway I got a great view of Six Flags, and it really put in perspective how much taller Titan is than the New Texas Giant (both great rides from prior experience)\n\nArlington, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located behind the e-sports arena, very easy to get here from the highway - less than a mile off of it.  It's got great views of AT&amp;T stadium, Globe Life Ballpark, and a bit of the Six Flags park, with well manicured lawns surrounding this portion of the parking lot; it overlooks a small pond.  I'm not sure how accessible this would be on a game day, but at 10AM on a Saturday with no events it's plenty available.  10 stalls here, and it's me plus one other car.  I'm drawing 100 kW from this very central to activities location.  It doesn't look like there are any food or bathroom options around, but there is a nerby trash can.  If you're looking to get something to eat, use a different charger.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5 (But I can see this being a huge issue if there's a Rangers game)\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.29\n\n\nDrive to Cisco, TX:\n\n121.6 mi, 353 Wh/mi\n\n- Pouring rain until about 5 miles outside Cisco, so no autopilot this entire leg.  Nice open plains once I got further out from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nCisco, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Flying J / Shell gas station with a Denny's.  In addition to the 8 supercharger outets, there's a single J-1772 that appears to be free (I didn't check if it worked).  Bathrooms insude the gas tation, and there are windshield cleaners in the gas station area.  There's also a small outdoor seating area here.  Very easy highway on/off, and a well maintained area.  I'm the only car here, puling arorund 130 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Sweetwater, TX:\n\n86.4 mi, 303 Wh/mi\n\n- I thought this leg was thoroughly uneventful, but it seems as though I got splashed by a huge mud pile on my driver side, so I'll have to find a car wash.  Didn't notice this while driving, just when I got out of the car for a delicious steak fries lunch at a local eatery before charging.\n\nSweetwater, TX supercharger:\n\n- Back behind a Holiday Inn express.  2 other cars out of 8 spots here when I got here, and I'm around 90 kW.  A couple guys rode in on their single wheel electric skateboard type things (sorry, I don't know what they're called), so that was exciting enough.  Garbage can present and the hotel has usable bathrooms.  Fine enough, but nothing great.  No food in walking distance.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.40\n\n\nDrive to Midland, TX:\n\n113.5 mi, 276 Wh/mi\n\n0 This leg was pretty cool to see.  There were a number of oil fields along the way as well as some processing plants.  With that, there was a lot of wide open road and open big country views.  I was just disappointed by about 10 miles straight of road work that was stripped to textured pavement giving a loud, bumpy ride.\n\nMidland, TX supercharger:\n\n- At the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel next door to a Love's gas station.  The souveniers in the Love's shop are pretty cool and very \"Texas.\"  It's right off the highway with easy on and easy off, and not too hard to find.  There's some food in the gas station, but nothing great.  There's a nearby garbage can and the view is pretty meh.  Clean.  I'm the only car here of the 8 spots, drawing around 140 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Pecos, TX:\n\n90.1 mi, 259 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful mountain shaddows in the backdrop.  Wide open road and the speed limit goes up to 80.  I'm surprised how good the efficiency I got was given the speed I was going, and how my AC is going strong (it's 94 F outside with a hot sun up above).\n\nPecos, TX supercharger:\n\n- Extremely easy to get to and very easy to find.  Right off the service road at a Flying J next to the Travelodge.  The travelodge has a nice little gazebo to sit at right next to the chargers.  Good size convenience store in the Flying J with available trash cans and restrooms.  8 chargers here and I'm the only car.  I'm ulling around 130 kW so a pretty good speed of charge.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $1.26\n\n\nDrive to Van Horn, TX:\n\n90.2 mi, 311 Wh/mi\n\n- Mostly wild flowers and small bushes.  My windshield has unfortunately become an insect graveyard.  Super easy drive.  Transition to plateaus is beautiful.\n\nVan Horn, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Hampton Inn.  Only amenity is bathrooms, and there is nothing in easy walking distance of this Hampton Inn.  This stop is very easy to get to from the highway and it's simple to get back on.  Views of the mountains are pretty nice from here with a lot of open space.  I'm the only car here right now, and unfortunately I'm only pulling between 30 and 60 kW (at 4A) so I may be here for a little while before heading to my next leg.  No outdoor garbage can, but it looks like someone left just a bag of trash by the big charger box.  This is probably one of the bottom few stations that I've visited on my trip.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 1/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.27\n\n\nDrive to El Paso, TX:\n\n131.1 mi, 272 Wh/mi\n\n- The drive through El Paso is pretty interesting, and the mountain backgrounds and surroundings on the way in look really nice.  You can get a good look at Ciudad Juarez as well as you're driving in.  I have somehow spent all sunlight today in Texas despite driving West and leaving at 7AM central, along with having no traffic.\n\nEl Paso, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at Rudy's Bar-B-Q (and not the Hampton Inn behind it).  Very easy highway access.  Because I missed my turn in I learned there's a touchless automatic car wash about a half block west of it, and after the long drive today my front windshield had become a Jackson Pollock painting of fly caracasses I decided to give it a go.  Sadly, the right hand side of the machine was broken so I don't recommend using this place.  When I got here, there were 2 other Teslas taking up chargers plus one charger that was ICEd with the family having a picnic in the charging spot next to their truck.  I'm starting to see a few more Teslas now as I'm going west.  The facilities here look pretty fine and well maintained.  Despite sharing 4A/4B (I wasn't going to park next to the truck) I'm still pulling 120 kW.  This is certainly a good spot to stop at, even if it's not pretty and there's no greenery.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.08\n\n\nDrive to Deming, NM:\n\n91.6 mi, 289 Wh/mi\n\n- It was dark out but the drive was easy.  I went through a border control checkpoint to the west of Las Cruces which was really simple.  Now, for sleep after charging.\n\nDeming, NM supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Valero gas station.  8 chargers and I'm the only car here.  Roughly 130 kW of power.  The chargers are off to the side of the building and while they're easy to find the area is poorly lit.  The Valero likely has a \npretty good selection and bathroom, but I didn't go in.  Garbage can is present.  The stop is about 1 mile north of the highway.  No real green space to walk around, but a couple cute cacti around the gas station.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.04\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nDrive to Wilcox, AZ:\n\n139.4 mi, 274 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful desertscapes.  Easy drive.  Smooth highway.  After charging the previous night, I had to backtrack a little bit to get to my hotel.\n\nWilcox, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Holiday Inn Express less than a mile from the highway.  Pretty ugly area; next to a large truck parking area.  Garbage can and bathrooms available within the hotel.  8 stalls, and only me + 1 other car, I'm getting around 120 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.52\n\n\nDrive to Casa Grande, AZ:\n\n146.5 mi, 232 Wh/mi\n\n- I absolutely love the desert landscape with the amazing natural rock formations.  This was my favorite set of scenery to drive through so far.  Except for the drive next to Tucson.  Tucson is really ugly from the highway.  There were also a couple instances where the autopilot detected me on the service road thinking the speed limit was way lower than it actually was and causing me to basically brake check myself.  Other than that, it was a pretty smooth drive.\n\nCasa Grande, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located behind a Chase bank in a strip mall.  There's a good set of food options here and the area is well maintained.  3 cars here now with 8 spots and I'm getting 110 kW.  Very easy to find from the highway and exceptionally easy \non/off.  Nicely manicured rockscape around, but unfortunely the chargers are parked such that you're facing into an active roadway/alleyway (this is basically a driveway onto it) where cars are flying down.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $2.50\n\n\nDrive to Buckeye, AZ:\n\n84.6 mi, 226 Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped in Phoenix on the way to do a quick socially-distanced walk through a park with an old friend, otherwise I would have driven around Phoenix and not through it.  But this did give me some nice views of the city's skyline.  Otherwise this segment is plenty pleasant with more of the manicured desert views.  However, Hank Hill said it best.  \"Phoenix is a testament to man's hubris.\"\n\nBuckeye, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Great location just off the highway in a small strip mall at a Carl's Jr.  There's plenty of food options and bathrooms here, and there's extremely easy highway access.  3 cars here including me at the 8 charging spots, and I'm getting roughly 110 kW.  The mall did a fine job on the landscaping but nothing too exciting.  I'll probably make a stop here each time I travel to Phoenix as it's pleasant and on my way.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 4.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Ehrenberg, AZ:\n\n116.9 mi, 291 Wh/mi\n\n- Nice desertscape with a few mountains.  Easy drive.  Very boring.  Almost back to CA!\n\nEhrenberg, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Very easy to get to via a roundabout.  Located between a Best Western and a Flying J that has a Wendy's.  A little bit of open green space in front of the chargers, but there's a giant gas tank on it and a weird smell here.  There are 8 chargers here, and I'm one of 3 Teslas plus 1 ICE here.  For about half a minute I was drawing the full rated 250 kW, but I've settled down around 170 for most of my charging session.  Definitely stop here instead of the Quartzsite location - they're about 15 miles apart on the same highway, but this one offers so much more.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.89\n\n\nDrive to Cabazon, CA:\n\n140.4 mi, 296 Wh/mi\n\n- I've done the later portion of this many times as I visit Palm Desert a few times a year.  The drive through the windmills is really cool.  Nice drive, open highway, this area always reminds me of home.\n\nCabazon, CA supercharger:\n\n- Located in an outlet mall with a really good variety of shops.  Right behind a McDonalds at one end of the outlets, these are all pull-forward stalls, with over a dozen available stalls, but I have had to wait for one due to heavy traffic here in the past.  There's a lot of trash all around here with a dumpster between a couple stations.  Very easy on/off.  One thing different about the CA superchargers - you pay by the kW, not by the minute leading to a much higher total price for supercharging, almost double the rate at other chargers around the country.  I'm getting a consistent 110 kW here.\n\nCleanliness: 2/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $9.24\n\n\nDrive to home:\n\n114.8 mi, 215 Wh/mi\n\n- I live in the San Fernando Valley, so I navigate on autopilot through a variety of freeway interchanges until I am finally home.  This has been an incredible road trip, I just wish it were under better circumstances.  I'm still shocked how easy this was to do and hope my experience can help others as they plan massive trips - it can certainly be done in an EV!\n\nDay 1: 746.9 mi, 257.5 Wh/mi\n\nDay 2: 689.3 mi, 262.1 Wh/mi\n\nDay 3: 917.8 mi, 292.8 Wh/mi\n\nDay 4: 742.6 mi, 258.0 Wh/mi\n\nTotal: 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86",

I can confirm this - I actually thought there was something wrong with the car after they were installed. \n\nBetter grip/traction. Nothing scientific here but I can say that the vehicle does seem to handle better. But the Michelins were at about 3mm so who knows. \n\nEfficiency improvement. Image speaks for itself. Other than a quick stop off at a bucees\u0019s we maintained about 70-75mph after we left stop and go (yellow) in Atlanta and the graph is SOLID green after that. We beat projected arrival in Chattanooga by over 12% battery (originally expected to have 8% on arrival). \n\nFor only $1400 for a set of 4 tires with 50k tread warranty - I\u0019m gonna go ahead and say - first impression is solid.",

Tried a firmware redeploy. Tried the EA CCS and CHAdeMo chargers. Nothing would convince the car to fast charge. \n\nI ended up at a 6kW L2 charger in Roseburg for 12 hours. And then I made the hard choice to return to Portland (170 miles) The next service center headed south would have been Chico (315 miles)\n\nDropped the car off at the Tigard Service Center, and they diagnosed it as the high voltage controller. I should have the car back in another day or two with a cost of less than $750. \n\nSo I guess I\u0019m stuck drinking awesome beer for a couple days!\n\nPs: this is a 2018 model 3 with about 190k miles on it. First issue in 140k miles. I still love the car AND Tesla service centers.",

      "title": "What to expect at 100k miles",
      "text": "Hey guys. I just crossed over 100k miles! 2018 M3 LR AWD, 19\u001d wheels, acceleration boost. Here\u0019s some info you can expect.\n\nTL,DR: drive in chill mode, don\u0019t give Tesla service your business, road trips are good (even with base autopilot), expect the squeaks, enjoy the fuel savings\n\n1. Depreciation- my car was worth ~$55k when new in 2018, and it is now worth &lt;$20k, nearly 70% depreciation in 6 years\n\n2. Battery- I bought my M3 at 23k miles, and it reported 280 miles as max range. It now reports 267, which is 86% of its original EPA rating of 310\n\n3. Range- I have never gotten more than ~230 miles on a full battery when road tripping. Part of the reason is I don\u0019t need to go that far between charges, another reason is most of the time when road tripping, the weather was cold.\n\n4. Road trips- since my car is pre-heat pump, I genuinely estimate my wh/mi as 340. The car is EPA rated for 242 wh/mi, but due to the cold and the sport rims, when road tripping in the winter, I get that kind of efficiency. This means in the winter I can expect an 80% range estimate at about 150 miles.\n\n5. Charging- I\u0019ve lived in apartments close to free public chargers for the life of the car, so I have paid very little in charging costs. I estimate my effective charge rate as about $0.06/kwh (including supercharging) or about $1300 in 3 years and 77k miles. Do that in a gas car that gets 30mpg and it costs $7,000\n\n6. Charging (contd)- people are very inconsiderate at public chargers. I imagine this isn\u0019t an issue with a home charging setup, but often in apartment living, you battle self-entitled teslas and chevy volts that don\u0019t move their cars away from the free chargers for days at a time. This has forced me to go to super chargers in the past, costing me time and money\n\n7. Car washes- I\u0019ve only ever used touchless, manual spray washes on the car. As a result, I\u0019ve never gotten crazy scratches all through the paint, and I\u0019ve never had condensation in the lights. I clay and polish the paint once per year. When I detail the interior, everything looks brand new.\n\n8. Service- Tesla service is awful. I had my AC go out, which they estimated as a $400 repair. I asked if they could fix a squeak in my back left wheel (it squeaks loudly when I reverse while turning). They quotes me $600 for everything, and I decided to pay because the sound was annoying. They went in, without my permission, and replaced all 4 brake pads, and some calipers, and charged me $1900\u0013and the service was already completed, so I felt like I had no choice but to pay. Looking back, I\u0019ll never make that mistake again and I\u0019ll laugh in their face. They didn\u0019t even fix the issue, and I\u0019ve been dealing with it for the last 30k miles now. For the rest of my ownership, I will be performing my own repairs or finding a 3rd party to do them. Discount tire can handle alignments, tire rotations, and other wheel services, and squeaks and rattles are just a thing. Just get used to them, or else the service center will make things worse by trying to help.\n\n9. Drive- I come from rural Illinois, and when I was there, the AWD performance was excellent. In snow it was great, and going for a sporty drive with lots of 0-60s was so fun. Now I live in the city in Texas, and there are so many people on the road I can\u0019t gallop! Also, I keep the car in chill now 95% of the time\u0014even normal acceleration in standard/sport causes the tires to spin, and wears them down significantly faster. Base autopilot is great too, you don\u0019t need anything more.\n\n10. Insurance- Tesla insurance is very adaptable. I used to drive 25k miles in a year for work, my premium was $210/mo in TX with a 96 safety score. Now I drive &lt;9k miles per year since I work remote and only sometimes commute 40mi round trip to the office, now my premium is $122/mo with a 99 safety score. It\u0019s the lowest price insurance you can find\u0014if a bit annoying for dinging you for driving past 11pm at night.\n\n11. Accessories- I have 4 accessories with my car. \n-Jeda V4 wireless charger for legacy M3 (gives the original M3 the alcantara charger like the 2021+\n-USB A to USB C adapters for rear\n-A small plastic clip on the driver side visor to prevent it from buzzing and making noise\n-Alcantara center console tray to hold my sunglasses, J1772 adapter, and change\n\n12. Noise- I have one of the unfortunate early M3 owners flaws, which is the motor whine issue. Newer cars don\u0019t have this, I believe, but my front motor whines pretty loud when driving. I try to ignore it. Also, when driving on the highway, there\u0019s a whipping sound of the air hitting my driver side mirror- I took it in to service twice for them to fix this, and they did nothing both times. The car creaks when going over curbs and speed bumps. The reversing squeak comes back all the time (the one I had to pay $1900 for that Tesla didn\u0019t fix)\u0014the solution is to go to a manual car wash and blast water into the brake calipers and on the rotors real good. The sound goes away for about 4 weeks. A GOOD noise I hear is the sound system which is amazing.\n\n\nConclusion: If I needed a new car today, I\u0019d think twice about getting a tesla. For the cost of the monthly payment, I\u0019d honestly probably go with an older used Lexus instead\u0014purely because of public charger inconvenience, poor tesla service, and poor tesla quality control. Don\u0019t kid yourself and think Tesla has figured out their quality control\u0014see for yourself that they\u0019re still misaligning doors (ambient lighting issues), their steering wheels are creaking, and there\u0019s condensation under the lights. With an older ICE vehicle, at least you have control over your own service, and for the cost of a $500+ monthly tesla payment, it\u0019d be much easier to own an older car outright in this economy.\n\nI\u0019ll keep the Tesla until it dies. But it\u0019s just a car. And that\u0019s okay. Just lower your expectations.",

      "text": "I'm usually excited to try the holiday update, but v11 has introduced some issues that are quite annoying:\n\n1. I left this morning on a road trip to Los Angeles from Napa, California. The battery was full and the supercharging stop was 200 miles away (Kettleman City), but the Model 3 started preconditioning the battery for fast charging immediately - 200 miles away from the supercharger! Because of this, my efficiency was very low - about 380wh/m. I let it go for about 30 miles to see if it would correct itself. It didn't, so I cancelled the navigation and it stopped preconditioning, so my wh/m soon went down to normal (about 230 wh/m in my case, as I try to drive efficiently).\n2. I have a very large dog (Alaskan Malamute, 126 lbs) who is often with me and takes up the entire back seat. Due to his panting, I need to regularly use the windshield defogger, but it's now no longer 1 tap away on the bottom button bar. I appreciate that the Tesla UI designers want to make it easier to use, but making common controls \\_more\\_ difficult to get to is not at all good. Right now I have to tap the temperature once to turn it on, tap it again to bring up the controls, then tap the windshield defogger. Ugh, so very annoying.\n3. The wh/m and other efficiency statistics are now only accessible via the global settings, and they overlay the entire map. For those of us who endeavor to drive as efficiently as we can, having it available via a simple swipe was great. No more, apparently - also so very annoying.\n4. When using navigation, the mini-nav view that displayed on the left if the right side of the screen was busy (i.e. when showing the efficiency statistics that now require navigation into global settings to see) is now gone. More ugh.\n5. Oh, but we get more colorful icons now. Great. I appreciate the ability to put the apps I want in the app bar, but I would like to put individual controls there - say, the windshield defogger, so I can toggle it with 1 tap like I could with v10.\n\nSeriously, so disappointing. I read that Tesla knows about some of these issues, so I hope they fix them soon. Right now, v11 is a large step back in usability in my case from v10.\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn",

Long story short Tesla told me it was the 16 volt battery and they won\u0019t have it in stock for 2 weeks so I need to fly back home. Is this a common issue or will I have to worry about the battery going out every 2 years?\n\nThey told me they can\u0019t ship it back to without it coming out of my pocket. also said I would need to fly back to pick it up but I\u0019m definitely going to fight back on that.\n\nUpdate #1 08-07-23\n\nI got an email saying they ordered a HV battery and will be arriving in 2-3 weeks. I asked for clarification but I\u0019m assuming that\u0019s the high voltage battery and this is worst case scenario. Luckily we are still well into our warranty, (only had the car for about 18 months) Will update when i confirm / will let everyone know what they reimburse. \n\nA lot of people have been asking why I didn\u0019t stay or try to fix it myself. I was on a quick 2 day vacation to the beach, the service center was closed over the weekend and we had to get back home for work so we took a flight out. We also get married in one month so everything is just on a tight time crunch. They claimed they will reimburse for all the expenses but I will be sure to update where I\u0019m at after the car is repaired. From what it seems like they will process everything after the car is repaired.\n\nUpdate #2  08/08/23 \n\nI called Tesla and they confirmed they ordered a high voltage battery and will be down for about 3 weeks. The LV original diagnostic was a virtual one when they didn\u0019t have the vehicle in the SC yet. When the car arrived they confirmed it was the HV battery. \n\nWorking with my local SC back home for a loaner, my insurance told me they won\u0019t cover a rental unless I was involved in a accident. Will update what my local SC says when they open up today.\n\nUpdate #3 08/08/23\n\nThis will likely be the last update until my car is fixed. My local SC told me they don\u0019t have any loaners available. They also mentioned their hands are tied since my vehicle isn\u0019t even at their SC. Apparently it\u0019s a new policy they can\u0019t allow cars to cross state lines / loan a car out to someone who\u0019s car isn\u0019t at that service center. At this point I\u0019m done, no point in raising my blood pressure any higher over this. I\u0019ll update everyone as soon as they say the car is ready / if they will hold their word on reimbursing me for all of my flights and Ubers. Car should be ready around August 28th.\n\nUpdate #4 12/25/23\n\nI\u0019ve had the car back since August 28th and it has been working normal since then. I\u0019ve charged it to 100 percent one time and the range actually read longer than the original range on the older battery. The SC ended up sending me a check for both of the flights to leave / come back to pick the car up. Will be sure to update if I have any issues.",

But definitely there. I\u0019m sure I could have been more authoritative and had something done right then, but new car&I want to drive it. \n\nWatch the YouTube videos your promoted to watch prior to taking off for the 1st time? Absolutely not, sir. I\u0019m out of there. For better or worse. \n\nIt\u0019s quick. Silly quick. \n\nDrive home was 100 highways miles, speed between 75-90, battery was 67% at time of pickup\u0014~15% on arrival. First time at supercharger was painless, less than 15 min to get it to the programmed (suggested?) 80%. \n\nThe wind noise heard from drive side window has to be a flaw. It sounds like the window is rolled down (\u001ccracked\u001d)\u0014but it could just be me coming from a \u001cluxury\u001d German brand and I\u0019m expecting too much? \n\nDid I mention it\u0019s quick, like scary (in the best way) quick. \n\nThe paint job isn\u0019t great. The hinges in trunk are half painted\u0014 half raw (maybe sealed?) metal, half painted color of car. Just looks sloppy. Petty, I know. But c\u0019mon. A little pride in your work would go along ways (am I the only one that feels that way). Other little flaws here and there, nothing awful. But literally any other car I would be pissed if it had a paint job like this. For whatever reason I\u0019m finding myself pardoning Tesla\u0014I don\u0019t know why, but I feel like it happens often\u0014giving Tesla a \u0018pass\u0019 on things like this. \n\nAnyways, probably haven\u0019t mentioned. It\u0019s incredibly quick.",

      "title": "2023 Model 3 RWD w/ No Upgrades - 1 Month In - My Feelings",
      "text": "I've been noticing a number of folks on this sub who are on the fence about the purchase of a Tesla Model 3 RWD. I purchased and took delivery of mine 3-4 weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nTo start, I go the most basic version you can get. Pearl White with 18\" Aero Wheels and Black Partial-Premium interior. I'm coming from a 2009 Mercedes E Class so this is my first car purchase is over a decade. Even at the most basic version of the model, the cabin experience is amazing. Quiet, comfortable, and everything feels high quality.  You get 95% of the same features of a M3P but for a much lower price. From the Tesla app, to the charging experience, to the exterior look and feel, the car has exceeded my expectations in every facet.\n\nThis is also considered the \"slow\" model but you could've fooled me. My favorite thing about this car is the instant acceleration and smooth-as-glass ride. It is indeed like a small space ship.  And for the money, after rebates, is a major value. Prior to looking at a Model 3 I was testing out more conventional brands hybrids and they were all just MEH at best. Cut to my first test drive of a Model 3 RWD and I was instantly sold. And when you factor all of the federal and tax incentives you get with the Tesla over a conventional hybrid, it really is a no-brainer. \n\nI went from driving hardly at all, to looking for excuses to get in my car every day. With the home charger installed, I feel like I'm somehow cheating the system.  \n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for 19\" wheels? NO**. I love the fact that I can go Aero Covers or Mag wheels depending on my mood. I bought lug nut and center wheel caps to give a sportier look when off.\n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for a different color? NO.** I didn't realize the white finish is actually slightly pearlescent, not flat white. With the black trim and blank tint, it's downright slutty. \n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for the Long Range battery? NO.** I have the charger in my garage which gives me 272 miles of range which is far more than I'll ever need between my house an a Supercharger. The LFP battery in the RWD is also a bit of a bonus as I'm learning because of it's longevity and ability to charge to 100% consistently. \n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for the faster Performance version? NO.**  I'm already pushing the speed limit every time I get in it and having a blast. Anything faster and I'd probably get in trouble.\n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for a white interior? NO.** I have kids.\n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for Advanced Autopilot or FSD? NO.** I will add these later when I feel the software is further along. \n\nTL;DR: Been driving a basic White 2023 M3 RWD and it's the coolest car I've ever owned.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the great feedback on this post. I just wanted to share my experience after 2 weeks with my M3. To address some commons questions:\n\n1. No, road noise/wind is not an issue for me. Maybe the dual pane glass is working better or maybe my previous car wasn\u0019t that quite, but it\u0019s not a problem.\n\n2. No, I am not a paid Tesla spokesperson but would welcome a job there any day!\n\n3. I charge at home using an L2 wall charger and usually top off from 85% - 90% to 100% daily which I\u0019m learning is not the best thing to do. The average cost in my area is $0.15 kWh. \n\n4. Glad to know the white interior is easy to keep clean. Next time I\u0019ll go white for sure. \n\n5. Biggest complaint so far is the heat that came from the roof on sunny days. Going to invest in sunshades to help reduce thermal gain. \n\n6. First world problem complaint: the Frunk closing mechanism is not great. You can\u0019t shut it hard but yet simply closing it will not fully latch the frunk so you need to push hard to get it to close correctly. \n\n7. Yes I realize my feelings may be different in 2 years or 5 years or in winter or whatever. I\u0019m just saying that my initial 2 weeks has been wonderful.\n\n8. OTD price before federal tax incentive and sales tax/title etc was $39,030. With tax incentive closer to $32.5K. Again, a major value and no gas required.",

      "title": "Highland Model 3\u0019s are not worth buying right now",
      "text": "I know many will disagree and downvote me. But I want to share my perspective as an owner of two Model 3\u0019s for the past five years, as well as being a TSLA shareholder.\n\nTesla has a huge surplus of inventory right now, primarily with the Model Y. That has created a unique window where you can buy a Model Y for substantially less than the HIghland Model 3.  The combination of the available $7,500 instant tax credit along with significant inventory discounts make the Model Y a steal right now.\n\nContrast that with the Model 3 where you have to choose between the lackluster RWD model, or pay an extra $8,750 to upgrade to the LR AWD model.  Neither model is eligible for the tax credit and neither one can be purchased from inventory at a discount.  The RWD model is slower, lacks AWD, has shorter range and a lower end audio system.  \n\nA LR MY can be purchased after tax credit for $37,490.  Compare that with the LR M3 at $47,740 and you will pay an extra $10K+ for a smaller car with similar performance and range.  Even more compelling is the Performance Model Y, which can be purchased for $40K.  We don\u0019t know the price of the Model 3 ludicrous but we can assume it will be thousands of dollars above the price of the LR model.  I would guess the spread between MY Performance and M3 Ludicrous will be close to $15K.  And the M3 is the smaller car.  0-60 on the MYP is 3.5 vs 2.9 on M3 Ludicrous.  Both are very fast.\n\nThere is a lot of pent up demand for Highland right now.  It\u0019s a very nice upgrade with a lot of nice touches.  But even with the improvements it cannot justify the price premium over the Model Y.  I predict in six months Highland models will be plentiful and inventory discounts will begin to materialize.  However, unless they change the battery components it will still not qualify for the tax credit.\n\nSo why am I posting this? Because I predict there will be substantial discounts on Highland models once the initial orders are met.  Soon to be followed by a wave of people posting how they can\u0019t believe that Tesla lowered the price so shortly after launch and now they have lost thousands of dollars in equity on their cars.  And then this will be followed by people responding that cars depreciate in value so live with it.  The cycle keeps repeating itself.  But it doesn\u0019t need to.  You can be a well informed buyer and wait until it\u0019s actually a buyers market for the car.  \n\nIt\u0019s clearly a buyer\u0019s market for the Model Y and a seller\u0019s market for the Model 3.  So take advantage of the incredible deals on the MY right now or sit tight and wait for prices to drop on the M3\u0019s.  It will happen.  History has a way of repeating itself with Tesla.  It\u0019s only a matter of time.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI honestly wasn\u0019t expecting so much attention to my post. I appreciate all the feedback and certainly don\u0019t expect everyone to agree with me.  I wanted to follow up on a couple of things that people have brought to my attention.\n\nI should have mentioned that the pricing and tax incentives are specific to the US.  Other countries have different pricing and incentives which could easily change the logic here.\n\nIt was not my intent to suggest that anyone who bought a Highland M3 made a bad decision. My goal was simply to point out to people who are new to the Tesla world that prices of Tesla vehicles can change very fast.  We still hear about how under water people who bought in 2022 were.  But I also believe that you should buy what you want. So if Highland is your preference by all means go for it. There is nothing wrong with paying a premium for something you enjoy.  I just wanted people to have all of the information on the history of Tesla pricing so that they can make the best decision for their needs.\n\nThanks again for the great discussion!",

      "title": "I kept track of all my Model 3 costs. Here's the breakdown of all costs for those interested.",
      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI bought my Tesla Model 3 two years ago in Toronto. Since then, I\u0019ve kept track of every dollar I\u0019ve spent on it. Here\u0019s what I\u0019ve spent on the car after 50,000km of driving. I hope this can help anyone who might be on the fence or wondering about how much it costs to drive a Model 3 in Canada.\n\n[I also made a video if that makes it easier to follow.](https://youtu.be/DcMV0wqtitw) \n\n## Cost of the Car\n\nI picked up my car on June 5th, 2018. At that time, there wasn\u0019t much flexibility when it came to options. I could only choose the long-range rear wheel drive option.\n\nHere\u0019s the breakdown of the cost.\n\nBase price of the car was $45,600.00\n\nLong range battery upgrade was $11,900.00\n\nPremium upgrade was $6,600.00\n\nIn terms of options, I went with the Midnight Silver Metallic colour, which cost me $1300 and I purchased Tesla\u0019s enhanced autopilot package for $6600, which included things like summon, lane changes, and lane keeping.\n\nAfter taxes, the car cost me $83,169.35.\n\nBecause I got my car before the provincial election in Ontario, I was able to qualify for the EV rebate, which at the time was $14000 in Ontario. I received that about 6 months after purchasing my car. That brought the total cost of the car down to $69,169.35.\n\nInsurance is kind of high where I live. I used to pay $192/month for the first couple years and a few months ago, my premium went up to $265/month because of a speeding ticket and more claims in my area. Overall, I\u0019ve spent $5,668.00 on insurance so far.\n\n## Charging Costs\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0019ve driven my car almost 50,000km. Most of the mileage comes from my daily commute to work, but I also took quite a bit of road trips.\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0019ve taken 3 trips to NYC from Toronto, 1 to upstate New York, 1 to Montreal, and 1 trip to Saskatoon. In total, I\u0019ve covered about 15000 kilometres on the supercharger network. Tesla bills by the minute and your rate per minute depends on the speed of charging. In total, I spent $407.78 on supercharging across all my trips.\n\nLike most Tesla owners, I charge my car at home. In Ontario, we get a lower electricity rate during off peak hours, so I\u0019ve set my car to only charge during off-peak hours. In total, I\u0019ve spent approximately $593 on home charging.\n\nSo, the total cost of charging for driving almost 50,000 kilometres is about $1001.38.\n\nIn comparison, if I drove a BMW 3 series for the same distance, I\u0019d spend approximately $6000 on gas.\n\n## Repair and Maintenance\n\nIn terms of repairs and maintenance, there hasn\u0019t been much.\n\nI got unlucky during my first month of ownership and cracked my windshield twice while driving on the highway to work. The first time, it was only a chip, which I got fixed for $100 at Speedy Glass. The second time, I got a big crack, so I had to replace my windshield. That cost me a $500 insurance premium.\n\nBecause I live in Canada and we get a decent amount of snow up here, I decided to get winter tires. I opted for the Michelin X-Ice Xi3 Tires, which cost me $1,178.77. I\u0019ve been going to KalTire for seasonal tire replacement, which costs $137 each time as I didn\u0019t buy separate rims for the winter tires. In total, I\u0019ve spent $551.44 on tires changes in 4 seasons.\n\n## Mods and Accessories\n\nI hadn\u0019t made many changes to my Tesla Model 3. I had the car tinted when I got it for $250 dollars. This included the side windows and partial rear window. At the time, most of the shops in my area couldn\u0019t do the full rear window and the ones who could were charging 3 times the price of partial. I got used to the partial window pretty fast.\n\nApart from that, I partially wrapped the front of the car with clear wrap. That cost $650. I should\u0019ve got the entire front wrapped, so if I were to get a new car today, I\u0019d wrap the entire front of the car.\n\nBecause of the wet winters here, I decided to get all season floor mats. I opted for the 3dMaxpider mats after doing a bit of research and the mats cost me $210.17.\n\n## Total Cost\n\nSo, the total cost of the car after the provincial rebate comes to $79,279.11 after 2 years and 4 months of ownership and 50,000km of driving.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you found this helpful, please [consider subscribing here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrP4jrEMokSG_iR6u5C7XTA).

Most of my long distance driving is under 200-300 miles in California. In both SR and LR models, this is the same 1 stop in each direction.\n* For the majority of my day-to-day driving in the city there is no difference between a SR and LR\n* The SR LFP battery is less prone to fire and a theoretical fire would be less severe [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/4-benefits-of-lfp-batteries/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/4-benefits-of-lfp-batteries/) , [https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/cars/tesla-lfp-battery/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/cars/tesla-lfp-battery/index.html)\n* The LFP battery is more ethically sourced. The materials are abundantly available and have fewer ethical labor concerns, especially relative to cobalt in NMC batteries.\n* The LFP battery theoretically has slower range degradation and a longer lifespan. Over time, the range gap between theoretical SR and LR models will narrow.

I can plug it in, charge to 100% and forget about it.\n* The SR is \\~200lbs lighter than the LR, which I hope ekes out a little more on efficiency and is better for tire longevity and tire particle pollution (just a hunch, I have no proof for this).\n* I get 95% of the benefits of having a Tesla at a fraction of the cost - the charging network, technology, wide accessory support, direct-to-consumer model\n* If I were to sell, I am hoping the depreciation on a $30k car hurts less than the depreciation on a $40k car\n* I don\u0019t drive fast enough for the dual motors to be worth it for me.\n\nI felt that the LR benefitted peace-of-mind, but offered no practical differences in my driving scenarios.\n\nIn the end, I got a new Standard Range Model 3 for $27k after rebates and $33k after all taxes and fees. It would have been $2k lower if I qualified for the state rebate. Been driving it for 3 weeks and done 2 road trips with no regrets so far. For a new car, this Model 3 SR a great value!",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I live in Montreal and I am looking at buying a model 3 (standard range or long range - I\u0019m still undecided). I always keep my vehicles for 12 plus years. My current one is over 15 years old and close to 300k km. Are there any estimates / projections of what a model 3 battery pack replacement will cost in 10 to 12 years from now (if ever I needed a replacement)? Thank you for your help and advice.\n\n*** Update *** thank you for all your comments and advice. I was not expecting so many to respond! I understand that ICE vehicles have their share of expensive repairs (transmissions, engines, exhaust&) My question comes from the fact that i have been driving ICE vehicles for over 30 years and the most expensive repair was a 2500$ transmission (7 years ago). When I see people talking about 17K$ battery replacements (and I understand it\u0019s a small % and most are still under warranty right now) - I find it a bit shocking. My expectation is that the cost of battery replacement over the next 5-10 years should go down as newer technologies become available. I also understand that most batteries may last 15+ years and that I may never need a replacement. My questions was more if you guys have seen any reports talking about battery replacement cost over the next decade or maybe know of companies that are starting to specialize in this type of business. Thanks again.",

      "text": "I'm in Louisiana and was just hit by a major hurricane and was out of power for about 70 hours.  While my city was spared with avoiding serious damage, being out of electricity in the summer heat here is dangerous.  Heat index the past few days was at 100 degrees, and my house's temperature was in the mid 80s at night.\n\nHaving a Tesla was a HUGE benefit.  I charged the battery to 90% before the storm and slept in the car for 2 nights in camp mode.  In the worst of the heat, when my fans running around the house on generator power wasnt enough to keep cool I put me and my 3 dogs in the car and cooled off watching netflix for a bit.  Talk about handy when you spend 3 days just covered in sweat.\n\nOther major bonus - the Tesla supercharger was available so I could charge my car with just a little wait time.  Right now, gasoline is VERY hard to come by and people search for operating gas stations and wait for hours hoping they can find some for their vehicles and to keep powering their generators.  I was able to charge up to full, drive an hour away from areas hit by the hurricane and fill up a couple more gas cans to deliver to people in need.  \n\nIf anyone is near Ida's path and is looking to help, these folks need gasoline the most. Neighbors are sharing gas and generators where possible, but the scarcity of gas is really crazy right now. Water, food and other supplies are also good.",

      "title": "Model 3 LFP Review after 60k miles",
      "text": "Hopefully this post will provide some info/context to anyone considering purchasing an LFP Model 3. I\u0019ll keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI took delivery of my LFP Model 3 on February 21, 2022. I drive a LOT for work, and I chose the Model 3 for the potential gas savings and autopilot. I\u0019ll share my actual savings below as well as degradation and repairs.\n\n**Battery Degradation:**\n\nAs of today, I\u0019ve driven just over 60k miles. I\u0019ve experienced roughly 4% degradation in this time. Brand new, the car showed 272 miles of range. It now shows 261. This has not impacted my daily driving in any way. I charge to 100% every day. Electricity is a flat $0.09/KwH in my area. I live in the south, so winters are moderate.\n\n**Range Anxiety:**\n\nI would comfortably trust this car for \\~190 miles on the highway at highway speeds (80mph) during the summer. During the winter, 140-150 miles. Far less than the advertised range. For me, I don\u0019t mind stopping every 2.5-3 hours to charge. I would normally stop for bathroom breaks and to stretch my legs, so this isn\u0019t a huge deal to me. That being said, if money were no object, I would go with the long range. More for the charging speeds than range. This car is limited to 170KW supercharging, while long range models can charge at 250KW. Faster charging would be nice.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nRepairs are minimal with this car, but I\u0019ve had a few.\n\n1: The most significant issue was a drive unit failure. The car just suddenly failed on me during a road trip - I couldn\u0019t drive the car at all. Thankfully this occurred while parked. I had to get the car towed to the nearest service center (90 miles away). Took Tesla about 3 weeks to fix. They paid for the repair and my rental car during this process. No issues since.\n\n2: I\u0019ve had the seal repaired on both front windows three separate times. I was experiencing significant wind noise, and replacing the window seals has yet to fix the issue completely; it\u0019s \\~ 80% better, but I suspect the front windows are misaligned on the track within the door, causing an imperfect seal when fully rolled up, thus causing wind noise at high speeds. Not an issue for city driving. I\u0019ve decided it\u0019s no longer worth trying to fix and I just deal with it.\n\n3: I\u0019ve replaced tires once in 60k miles, costing roughly $1600. I didn\u0019t rotate tires properly during this period causing my back tires to wear rapidly. Tesla recommends rotating tires every 6000 miles or so.\n\n4: I had the back glass replaced due to a rock cracking it. \\~$800 repair.\n\n5: not technically a repair, but it cost me $1300 to have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet at my house. My mobile connector was included with the car at the time of purchase, but Tesla no longer includes these for free. This will add \\~$250 to your charging installation cost.\n\nNow onto savings. My previous vehicle was a 2014 Ford Fusion Energi (plug in hybrid) which got around 40mpg when running in hybrid mode. Over the last year according to the Tesla app, based on gas prices in my area and my previous car\u0019s MPG, I\u0019ve saved around $2200. Not quite the savings I was looking for, but if you\u0019re switching from a less fuel efficient vehicle your savings would be better. Gas is roughly $3.20 in my area as of Sept 18th 2023.\n\n**Things to consider when purchasing:**\n\nI live in a small town, and none of my local tire shops will accept any Teslas for tire rotations. The nearest Tesla service center is two hours away. This won\u0019t be an issue for me 99% of the time, but for any repairs larger than a tire rotation, I would have to drive two hours to have my car worked on. Thankfully, Tesla mobile service alleviates most issues. I can have my tires rotated for around $70 with mobile service. (Yes I will be doing this myself in the future, I\u0019ve since purchased the required tools)\n\nTLDR; After 60k miles, I\u0019ve experienced 4% degradation in my Model 3 LFP. 272mi -&gt; 261mi. I charge to 100% every day. I\u0019ve experienced range anxiety one time in 60k miles, but I drive an abnormal amount. Repairs have been minimal. Best car I\u0019ve ever owned, but if I could do it again I\u0019d get the long range for faster charging speeds.",

      "text": "Back in 2017 I wanted an affordable way to go all-electric.  So I decided to go with the refreshed Nissan Leaf 40 KWh.  I assumed that Nissan (having made the Leaf for years) knew what they were doing with electric cars.  I was badly mistaken.  The car was perfect for around the city trips.  It still is the quietest car I've ever driven.  But an overheating battery, poor efficiency, and unreliable dealership chargers (my sole method for road tripping) just made for a super miserable experience.\n\nI took what I learned from the Leaf, cut my losses, and decided that what I needed was a good charging network, a liquid cooled battery, and a CCS plug.  Enter the Chevy Bolt.  I heard about this new network called Electrify America and their plan to cover the United States and thought THIS was a good affordable car option.  And it would have worked perfectly, except there were still 2 issues that made some trips a bit of a drag... max 50 KW charging and Electrify America's truly awful reliability in the early days.  The reliability still is pretty bad with Electrify America but it is getting better.  Anything is better than how they were!\n\nThen in 2020, the Chevy Bolt battery recall hit.  At first I got extremely frustrated at all of the issues I'd had up to that point, plus this.  But I turned this issue into an opportunity to get rid of the Bolt with a buy-back and get into a Tesla.  I got the Bolt bought back at almost the full purchase price and then used that to buy a 2021 Model 3 SR+.  I'm extremely happy with the Model 3 and I'm blown away with the ease of charging!\n\nSo I hope you enjoyed my story of mistakes and suffering!  I wish every EV was like this, because this is how it should be.  And I hope y'all can appreciate just how good the Tesla hardware really is!\n\nOh and, because I feel the comments coming, I really wanted to own an affordable, non-luxury, hatchback.  I have a big dog and we go on adventures constantly, so a cheap hatchback I can tear up is still preferable... but I guess I can make the Tesla work :)",

      "text": " \n\nI have been a long-time tesla model 3 owner and made a decision long-time ago to never buy another ICE car. Our model 3 has been my daily driver and only car for the past 3 years and I have put 150k miles on it (I travel a lot for insurance industry).\n\nNow my wife is pregnant and her work location is little further away from home so we desperately needed a second car. But I really didn't want to spend 65k for model y so I was looking for alternates. I found a dealer who sold the Mach-E to me at MSRP so I thought we got lucky and picked up the car on October 26, 2022.\n\nInitially we liked the car. While there were some things that we missed coming from Tesla they were by no means a dealbreaker. The infotainment is by far Mach-E's biggest weak point and connecting apple car play everytime seems like such a step back to Tesla's experience of just using the in-built NAV system.\n\nHowever our experience changed drastically on November 6, 2022 when it suddenly stopped charging at home. Turns out it was an issue with battery management system and it took the dealer 3 weeks to repair it. While we didnt get a loaner for the first week we got a loaner later so it ended up being an acceptable outcome. We got the car back November 25, 2022.\n\nAnd on December 14, 2022 the car did the same thing again. It stopped charging and gave me the same error messages. This frustrates me so much since it seems like every 15 days the car breaks down for nothing. I want a car that can be my daily driver and since I put a lot of miles and plan to keep it for 10 years or more it has to be able to survive 500k miles and this does not give me confidence that this car can do that.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that its worth it to pay the extra 6k or so for the model y and get the reliability than go through this BS. I know I will get a lot of downvotes for this but frankly speaking Mach-E is not a reliable car and I plan to lemon law this car once it crosses 30 days out of service.\n\nMy advice is if you plan on putting a lot of miles on the car or if you plan to keep this car out of warranty then don't buy it because its not a reliable car.",

      "text": "I finally made the switched to an EV and picked up my beautiful new blue M3.  Some notes from my first day using the car that could help any other first timers to the Tesla ecosystem.\n\n1.  I was put off by the delivery experience at the dealer as my car was not ready in time.  Had to wait about 25 minutes past my appointment time to finally see my ride.  The worst part is that the battery was only 13% charged, which blew my mind when they told me this.  My first time rollout out with an EV and they throw my into battery anxiety straight.  I have never picked up an ICE car where the fuel wasn't 100% topped up - not a great experience Tesla.  I basically had to find a supercharger 5 miles away to ensure I could get home. \n\n2.  The turn signals are definitely taking some time to get used to.  The way it works when changing lanes is that once your lane change is completed the camera should pick this up and turn off the turn signal, but this only happens about 95% of the time.  I noticed a few times after completing my lane change, the turn signal did not come off and pressing it again does nothing.  I basically had to press the turn signal for the opposite direction to turn it off - so annoying!!\n\n3.  After I did my first quick charge at the supercharger, I then had to revisit again later in the evening only to find out that I am receiving a message that I cannot use the supercharger because of an issue with paying for the charge earlier in the day. I checked my credit card and the payment from earlier went through with no issues, I even checked on the tesla app and it was showed as paid.  After trying to troubleshoot for 20 minutes and trying to find an answer on google/Reddit, I called tech support and they said it was a glitch.  To resolve it I had to go into my profile and reconfirm my mailing address, and that resolved the issue.  It also took forever to get through to an agent. Hopefully this is the last glitch that I ever have to deal with. \n\n4.  The regenerative braking is easy and intuitive.  I read another recent thread where someone simply hated but I found it super easy.\n\n5.  FSD is no where close to optimal.  I only feel comfortable using it when there is very little traffic around.  It made several major mistakes where I had to take over control.  I would really only feel comfortable using it on highway driving with not much traffic.  I will never use it for merging onto or off  highways.  Also I'm finding it a bit jarring when taking control, I have to steer the wheel forcefully at times and it makes the car swerve a bit when it releases control to me.  I'm sure I will figure out a way to do this more smoothly as I get used to it.  ",

      "text": "So I haven driven my car for just over 1k km and I can definitely say it has been an amazing ride! I love the instant acceleration a lot!\n\nThings I love about my Tesla:\n- The acceleration: it definitely feels much faster and nimble than other ICE cars I have driven.\n\n- Light design: I really like the design and how less bulky it looks compared to the older models. (Picture with snow)\n\n- Defrost mode and warming up the car from a far distance! Like when you are in a shopping mall and the car is several hundred meters away. You will arrive in a warm car and it does warm up very very fast\n\n- high beams: I have read other people having issues that they aren\u0019t responsive enough for oncoming traffic but mine are dimming every time it detects lights of an oncoming car far ahead. Can\u0019t wait for the adaptive high beam assist!\n\n- The sentry cameras! They are very clear! I love that during winter they were the only parts that stayed unfrozen. Quite cool to see that. (Picture)\n\n- visibility of the windscreen! It sometimes feels as if there is no window at all! But this is also weather depending.\n\n- Almost 600L of trunk space! I can fit two check in bags and a carry on bag in it. Plus I can add another bag at the front! \n\n- Responsiveness of the infotainment system, finding signals and just the whole Tesla technology to keep you safe.\n\n- Blinkers: yes you adapt and overcome haha! It takes about a week to get used to it. The blinker at the top is always for the direction your thumb is pointing to. So when the blinker is on the left side then the top blinker is pointing in the same direction of your left thumb. When you are on a roundabout and the blinkers are upside down then it\u0019s on the right side so the top blink you feel will be for going to the left just like your right thumb is pointing at.\n\n- Tesla Supercharging convenience! And other charging stations. With so many charging locations it\u0019s hard to run out of battery in Europe these days.\n\nThings I don\u0019t like so far:\n- Automatic wipers. They turn on where the sun is blinding the camera. They are not frequent enough in auto mode when it\u0019s raining. Maybe they will release a better software update. During winter this results in smearing dirt over the window and then you have to use the fluid to clean it off. (Picture)\n\n- Spotify that starts playing as soon you unlock and enter your car. I wish it would just turn on when I press the button.\n\n- The menu / Spotify won\u0019t go down automatically so you have the swipe down every time to see the map again. I wish there was a back button or maybe I don\u0019t know about it.\n\n- Navigation: I wished it zoomed it when you need to exit the highway or change lanes to stay on course. I think with Apple car play or Waze it shows this better.\n\n- Tesla Map: wish it was more zoomed in a bit.\n\n- Mirrors in reverse: can\u0019t change the position of the side mirrors when going in reverse. Also the rear view mirrors seem to not dim as fast as I have seen in other cars with a little sensor under the mirror?\n\nAnyway all in all, I\u0019m really happy about this car and I wouldn\u0019t want any other one! Or maybe the S in 5 years",

      "text": "I own a 2020 Model 3 Long Range Performance and last month I experienced my first technical issue. What I found extremely anxiety inducing is Tesla pushes you to schedule a service appointment. To make matters worse, the issue I was experiencing was not explained. The notifications basically stated that my speed limits were reduced (to either 46 mph or 63 mph), that exiting and re-entering the vehicle *may* restore functionality and that it was ok to drive.\n\nThrough the Tesla app the earliest appointment I could reserve was 3 weeks out, but during that time the issue never came up again, so I cancelled the appointment. What drove me to cancel was also the $300 charge for a general service diagnostic that I was being told was mandatory. I've worked on cars my entire life and the only time I've ever needed a diagnostic performed was when I had a Mitsubishi Eclipse no start with no check engine code. That was over 20 years ago. My Tesla is leaps and bound smarter than that Eclipse so it shouldn't need a diagnostic, the car should tell them what needs to have done.\n\nOf course, the day after I cancelled the appointment the issue happened again and again. Twice it happened twice during the same trip. Trying to find a workaround online I found people mentioning there is a \"Service Mode\" that you can access by touching the Model 3 icon on the service screen and then entering \"service\" for the password prompt that pops up.\n\nService Mode blew my mind. Through it I was able to see that low battery coolant is the cause of the issue. The only posts I could find were about people taking their car to the repair center and them not having to pay much because they were covered under warranty. A couple said they weren't told what the issue was, and few said that the issue was fixed after Tesla replaced their \"super bottle\" which I learned later was Tesla's term for the coolant reservoir.\n\nFeeling helpless, not knowing that I could fix the issue, I set another appointment with the repair center. This time it was only two weeks out and this time the app recognized the low coolant reason and allowed me to choose it for the reason of the appointment. The estimate was only for a thermal coolant diagnostic, and it was only $24. I can live with that, but the Friday before the appointment I get a call from Tesla and it was from the person at the repair shop. He just wanted to confirm my appointment and let me know I wasn't going to have a loaner, nor would they be reimbursing $100 towards taking an Uber. The next day a notification came from Tesla regarding my repair appointment. The general diagnostic charges were added again making this appointment more than the last one. This time I had someone I can communicate to, but only through the app messenger.\n\nI questioned why an additional diagnostic fee was added and why did they need to do two tests. I was told it was necessary. I sent him screenshots of the service mode, but he said it was still necessary. I asked what happens when they discover the issue was manufacturer related, do I get reimbursed? The coolant isn't something I can maintain. He said that my Basic Warranty expired, and I am responsible for repairs. I said I just want more coolant added then. He said that can't be done. They need to discover why my coolant is low.\n\nThe night before the morning of my repair shop adventure I made one last effort to find a solution and by an act of God I found a blog where the Tesla owner posted that they fixed the issue I was experiencing by going to Napa Auto Parts and purchasing the battery coolant from them. He gave a [link ](https://www.napaonline.com/en/p/ZRX861583)in his post. I figured if this was the case then there should be instructions on how to do this yourself. That's when I found [https://service.tesla.com/en-US/](https://service.tesla.com/en-US/)\n\nThis site is not referenced in the Tesla app or on the Tesla website that you can login to see information about your car. The manuals on this official site are better than any Chilton's manual ever was. Also, the Service Mode that people made seem like a secret is explained how to use it on this site. They even tell you how to access it and what the password is.\n\nHope this helps whoever reads this. Thank you for taking the time to read my rant. I needed to get it off my chest and hope this helps the Tesla community.\n\nP.S. I refilled the coolant, which cost me $20 and have checked on the fluid levels daily, they haven't dropped at all. Best of all, I haven't been in limp mode, nor has the code come back. Oh, and I ran thermal tests and even purged the cooling system by using Service Mode as well. Enjoy the mode DIYers, it's amazing.",

      "title": "2000 Mile Roadtrip from LA to Colorado. First long road trip (Pics) =\n",
      "text": "I never write blogs or long posts but I just went on an amazing trip with my M3 LR RWD and wanted to share. I bought this car 2 years ago and due to work travel and COVID I only have 13K miles on the odometer.\n\nAn opportunity arose due to my friend getting married in Colorado and I\u0019ve never been to any of the national parks in the desert south west so I decided to make a rod trip out of it!\n\nI drove from the LA area to Bryce Canyon and stayed a few days, then to Moab UT for a night, then to Durango CO for 3 nights then home through New Mexico &amp; Arizona. Story and Pics follow.\n\nI left around 8am and drove to Bryce. It's a 530 mile trip and took \\~9 hours. I roughly mapped out the trip via ABRP with conservative settings to get an idea of the trip and made sure to stay at hotels that had destination chargers. My first and most range anxiety stop was at Primm, NV. The car said from the start I'd arrive at 7%. If you\u0019ve done this drive from LA after Baker there is a large uphill incline followed by a long decline to state line. Going up the hill I had less range than the distance to destination. My wife was super nervous as was I. I drafted behind a semi which BTW I'm not even sure I did properly as I don\u0019t know how to actually draft LOL. Anyway coming down the hill I regen\u0019ed almost the entire way and arrive with 6% and 19m range. I should have just realized and trusted the car from the beginning.\n\nThis was a pic during the moments of stress\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/lm6SMgG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lm6SMgG.jpg)\n\nSo hot&so many fires along the way \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/n8OlGTH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/n8OlGTH.jpg)\n\nMe charging in Primm, NV at 118 ambient. 130+ Kw\n\n[https://imgur.com/0oWgO2J.jpg](https://imgur.com/0oWgO2J.jpg)\n\nWe had lunch in the casino and headed on to St George UT. Since my wife was super nervous about range from the prior stop she asked we top off in Vegas so we did. This downtown charger was in a weird place with nothing around. We stopped for only 5 mins since there was nothing around, but it never mattered since we arrived at St George with \\~105 of range\n\n[https://imgur.com/1iE65bn.jpg](https://imgur.com/1iE65bn.jpg)\n\nSt George, UT was a challenge. It was so hot that day the heading across the NV desert my car registered in at 119F.\n\n[https://imgur.com/2Ppo7o4.jpg](https://imgur.com/2Ppo7o4.jpg)\n\nWhen I arrived in St George I had 104 miles and there was a line at the charger. I had to wait 15 mins then realized why there was a line. The car told me to charge for 20 mins but it took over an hour with \\~30Kw max charge speed. It wasn\u0019t just me as other cars were there a long as me and the line grew. I guess it was the heat...it was blazing hot although I charged in Primm at 118F and had no problems.\n\nThis was the only \u0018annoyance\u0019 in charging but we made the best of it and I made it to Bryce which is a large elevation gain with 29% SOC...i guess I waited too long in the St George heat and that slow 30Kw =\n\n\nWe stayed at the Bryce Canyon Best Western. They had 4 chargers. No problems although one of them requires you to park in a no parking spot to make the cable reach. Bryce is \\~8-9K feet so the temp was cooler. Still hot with highs in the 90s. I\u0019ve didn\u0019t know that any state had an 80mph speed limit but Utah does!\n\n[https://imgur.com/80kIrn2.jpg](https://imgur.com/80kIrn2.jpg)\n\nThis is the part where we deviate from the car a bit. Stayed 3 days. Hiked and road horses. Amazing place...breath taking\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZZpClbt.jpg](https://imgur.com/ZZpClbt.jpg) \n\n[https://imgur.com/TGM6CzI.jpg](https://imgur.com/TGM6CzI.jpg) \n\n[https://imgur.com/a5bAOVA.jpg](https://imgur.com/a5bAOVA.jpg) \n\n[https://imgur.com/oXgFycB.jpg](https://imgur.com/oXgFycB.jpg)\n\nFrom Bryce we headed to Moab and stopped at Green River which was a great charging station with a very good local restaurant across the street.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/q9cICow.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/q9cICow.jpg)\n\nMoab was very hot \\~110F, but Arches national park was as expected. I figured I\u0019d be able to drive through get out for a few mins, take it in, and get back into the car. I was able to do that. Camp Mode was awesome for this =\n Yeah yeah I know there are hikes and things I could have done but I wouldn\u0019t be in this trip if it weren\u0019t for the wedding so the time of year and temps were just part of the coincidence of me even having driven here in the first place.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KHyxV4p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KHyxV4p.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3h2Vg4v.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3h2Vg4v.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/f3uaBYh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f3uaBYh.jpg)\n\nIn Moab we went to a winery after an amazing drive along the Colorado river. I knew Utah had strict laws on drinking but man this was a let down if you like to relax and have a drink. I knew something was up with the tasting was $1 per person. The drive was amazing though and that\u0019s what matters\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ZuQaPDc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZuQaPDc.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/yX6GlSD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yX6GlSD.jpg)\n\nFinally, the wedding! I wish we had more time on Moab but alas we woke up and headed to Durango. In Durango our hotel had 4 destination chargers and no problems finding an open spot. We stayed at the Double Tree which was a amazing hotel on the local river.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/010ACw8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/010ACw8.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/5e2mbZc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5e2mbZc.jpg)\n\nDowntown Durango was very cool. Lots of small locals shops and a great Winery named Four Leaves\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/QDBTCGX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QDBTCGX.jpg)\n\nThis is an Aerial shot of the historic narrow gauge train depot\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/aPMQjQZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aPMQjQZ.jpg)\n\nDurango was beautiful and we took this awesome historic train ride from Durango to Silverton. This ride is 9 hours pre-COVID but only 3 now due to 50% capacity and the financial ability of the entire run. It was still amazing.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ric0c8o.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ric0c8o.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ik4KhcT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ik4KhcT.jpg)\n\nOh and we couriered the bride\u0019s vale all the way to the wedding! \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/BWCedu1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BWCedu1.jpg)\n\nAfter 3 days in Durango having a great time with friends, we headed home through New Mexico and Arizona. Coming into New Mexico from Colorado put us in the Navajo Indian Reservation. Talk about a depressing place. The landscape was ugly, the roads were bad, and there were \u001cdon't drink and drive signs\u001d all over the place including the do not enter signs all over the media separated highway which suggests a lot of people go flying down a divided highway the wrong way.\n\nWe stopped to charge in Gallup, NM which is a skip. There is nothing in walking distance at all. That said charging was fast! \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/YMrJjet.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YMrJjet.jpg)\n\nWe also stopped at Holbrook, AZ. We didn\u0019t need to charge but were hungry an there is a Burger King there. Now off to Flagstaff where we spent a night and hit local bars which was fun as it\u0019s a college town. We charged at the super charger which is in the hotel parking lot we stayed in and then woke up to head home the next day.\n\nOn the way home we stopped in Needles, CA just past the border. I suppose I forgot to take a pic because I can\u0019t find one but it\u0019s a good spot at a Dairy Queen which fortunately in this blazing hot place has partial shade on the chargers depending on on time of today you go. I was there about 9:30am\n\nFrom there we headed to Barstow which requires a solid charge as the elevation gain is \\~4K feet and it\u0019s one of the most desolate drives I\u0019ve ever done. There is absolutely nothing out in the Mojave desert except blazing heat and sand. Running out of charge or breaking down out here would suck. It was \\~150 miles and I used 250 miles of range to achieve it but I arrived with plenty.\n\nCharging in Barstow was nice. They have 12 stations and shade. There are several places to eat in a short walking distance.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/JNmsVmM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JNmsVmM.jpg)\n\nFrom there I was home in 90 mins!\n\nThis was a great trip and while my wife didn\u0019t really understand why i didn't want to fly for me in addition to seeing these amazing national parks I wanted to see what it was like to drive an EV thousands of miles and frankly as I mentioned at the beginning I\u0019ve had this car 2 years with only 13K miles and I wanted to road trip away from this COVID isolation. The trip was amazing, the car is amazing. A few closing thoughts\n\n1 - Charging is not slower than pumping gas. Yeah filling the tank takes 5 mins, and charging takes 15-30 mins but depending on the situation but after driving for hundreds of miles for multiple hours getting out to get a drink, stretch, grab a bite to eat is what I would have naturally done anyway and the time at the stop felt totally normal.\n\n2 - The issue in St George was an anomaly IMO. It was almost 120 degrees ambient and the charger was busy.\n\n3 - The trip was super smooth and EAP relieves a lot of driving fatigue. I don\u0019t know how to explain it but using EAP makes you far less fatigued than normal driving. I was able to stretch my legs, enjoy some scenery, and overall feel more after each leg of the trip.\n\n4 - Lastly&..it\u0019s amazing to me that we have technology that can hurl me across the desert in 100+ temps at 85mpg for hundreds of miles in luxury all using a battery!! I hope you all enjoyed reading this. I enjoyed writing it.",

I got a notification that said \u001cUnable to charge\u001d \u001cMaximum charge level and range may be reduced\u001d\n\nSo of course I went to the app to service schedule again! I was quoted 12k for a new pack. That\u0019s expensive as hell! So I\u0019m not sure what to do now!\n\nI figured out a way to reset it so that I can charge but that only last for so long!

      "text": "Hi guys, owner of a 2023 M3RWD here,\n\nI don't think this is as well known as it should be, but there are four disabled speakers in your M3 base models, 2 in each A pillar and 2 other surround speakers.\n\nI think there's been some posts about a Hansshow audio harness that they used to offer but as of 12/06/2023 has been taken off their website that goes for $59-85 that would enable such speakers with the tools included in the purchase. Seeing a few of the comments realizing that they ship from China, I thought to check Aliexpress for the exact same product now writing Hansshow as a dropshipper. Alas, the exact audio harness appeared on AliExpress for around the $30 price range.\n\nI was initially worried that noone has vetted this specific harness, and I might be wasting my time with a harness that doesn't actually fit my car, however, after one cut on my index finger, hour and a half of crawling upside down in my car meticulously pulling panel pieces off as gentle as I could. I eventually installed the harness, put my car back together, and the sound is extremely noticeable.\n\n**Sound before**: I was able to tell that the sound was coming from the bottom left of my vision (on the A pillar), weak bass response.\n\n**Sound After**: The sound surrounds from the entire windshield and the bass response now violently vibrates my drivers door as I rest my arm.\n\nI did all of this from utilizing one YouTube video (for my 2023 M3RWD):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK-M4I3B41Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK-M4I3B41Y&amp;t=647s)\n\nWith the harness I bought from this link:\n\n[https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805953967009.html](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805953967009.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.21ef18023pcf99&amp;gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)\n\nProof that I 'tore' apart my car:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/njWtLJzz](https://postimg.cc/njWtLJzz)\n\nRemember to disconnect the LV battery before starting to unplug any other cables y'all!\n\nI will be keeping my post open to answer any questions or concerns you guys may have. But for $30, this upgrade is a no-brainer and reduces the difference between your base model vs the LR by one difference. I also managed to not break any panels nor plastic screws so yay! This installation really wasn't that hard, I'd say this is on the same level as changing the oil in a Toyota in terms of difficulty.  \n\n\nEdit: As someone pointed out, disconnecting the HV battery may brick your Tesla, and isn't required! \n\nEdit 2, Electric Boogaloo: I found that the navigation voice is still very audible and understandable. It\u0019s not muffled as some other reports state and I am at the most up to date software version.\n\nEdit 3: I guess I have to clarify the \u001cextra bass\u001d that I have observed. The harness enables 2 tweeters at the window level door right at the base of the A pillar and the two midrange speakers at the top of the A pillar. I have great reason to believe this mid range speaker is responsible for the perceived additional bass response, as I can physically feel the intense vibrations coming from this speaker. You don\u0019t need a subwoofer to add bass! Mid range speakers even with a bandpass filter can asd onto the lower end as low as 150Hz even restricted!",

      "text": "2019 LR **RWD** with the 19's, black, 25k miles. One accident that required replacing the bumper, front right fender, mirror, and rocker panel ($15k in damage), repaired by a Tesla certified shop, looks and drives great. I was not at fault and received $6k for diminished value.\n\nI have regretted quite a bit not getting the dual motor, but I really wanted black and they only had white available in AWD in time before the tax credit halved again. I have since been planning to get a performance in a few years, but now...\n\nLike many of us, I am now considering taking advantage of the market and trading in. I'm thinking about a red LR, and I'd stick with the 18\" wheels this time around because I love the dark wheels with the new dark trim. Tesla's offer for my 2019 using their calculator is $35,800. I put $15k down and still owe $22k. Considering that I received $3750 in federal tax credit, another $2k in state tax credit, and $6k for diminished value, I feel that I'm not in a bad spot! I will of course lose the $3k for tint and PPF though.\n\nI could potentially go without a car for a little while, but this is not really practical. My hope would be to either get lucky and get an early VIN, or that the used car market is still crazy when my delivery time comes a few months from now and my trade value is similar to the $35k it is now. If the value of my trade is substantially lower (as I expect), I simply refuse delivery and I'm out $100, and some lucky person gets the VIN.\n\nOne additional concern is that I perhaps got one of the \"better\" model 3's in terms of having any issues. The car has been flawless and the PPF folks even commented that the paint and alignment was better than most they see. I would hate to get into a new one and have paint or other nagging issues that would inevitably fuel some regret.\n\nWhat would you do?",

      "text": "Very soon I'll have my Tesla Model 3 and today I noticed that fuel costs in Australia have risen crazily. I have a Toyota Hilux which uses about 16 L per 100km. This equates to about 26 cents per km in cost. A typical day of riding costs around $200 (car fuel, bike fuel, track fees, coffee / snacks) with fuel just for travel usually being around 50% of the total cost.\n\nThe approach with the Tesla is to use my home solar to primarily charge the car as much as possible (13.2 kW system). Therefore minimising the cost to fuel the vehicle to zero in an ideal scenario.\n\nResearch so far shows that towing has a huge impact on the Model 3 range. I can't really find a good example to compare though but it is significant. I can't tell if weight or aero is the biggest impact, as the worst example (caravans) is bad on both fronts.\n\nThe Tesla has a cited range of 491 km, and the trip to the track is 280km return. Research shows that the impact to an EV can be up to 57% when towing a caravan, and around 15-20% with aero altering accessories like bike racks and roof boxes.\n\n[https://www.zecar.com/resources/tesla-towing-guide](https://www.zecar.com/resources/tesla-towing-guide)\n\nI am thinking of gutting a box trailer I have (which was a bargain purchase of $200), with a target trailer weight of around 150 kg. The bike is around 100 kg, with perhaps 20 kg in fuel and track items I usually take with me. All up, the total payload is around 270 kg. To visualise the aero, probably looking to have a trailer which looks like this: \n\n[https://www.easytrailer.com.au/page38.html](https://www.easytrailer.com.au/page38.html)\n\nBased on a range of 491 and a travel distance of 280, a maximum drop in range of 43% would be permissible. I don't think the aero of a dirt bike and the weight of the trailer / bike would be worse than a caravan, but a limit of 43% would be touch and go perhaps?\n\nThere are no public fast chargers (or any chargers) available between the track and home.... the joys of Australia where infrastructure is spread huge distances.\n\nDoes this seem doable? Anyone have figures of the impact of a small trailer, like a box trailer, motorcycle trailer or foldable trailer?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm doing it to save $$$ (fuel and maintenance), trying to be green, and because I'm a geek. I'm also leasing as I expect the HW to change significantly e.g. battery technology by the time my lease is up. \n\nReading about 72 month purchase agreements, spending thousands (USD) on paint protection, \"deleting\" chrome , how to wash it to avoid \"swirls\" etc. puzzles me. At the end of the lease, Tesla's crap paint job won't be a \"normal wear and tear\" charge; leasing a Model 3 requires you to turn the car in at end of lease so that the cars can populate the forthcoming autonomous fleet. Trying to blame me for shitty paint is going to be a (legal) party.\n\nWhatever works for you is great, but: what was the base motivation for your decision? \"I want a cool car\" is fine; are there other decisions that \"rode along\" with that sentiment?\n\nAgain: not judging, just genuinely curious.

Most recently, last year; I bought a \u001822 Honda Accord Hybrid (I was not fully committed to all electric yet) and love the fuel economy and the smooth transition from gas power to all electric in certain conditions (especially cruising the last mile home on all electric). My commute is about 10 miles to work through light city/ highway traffic. With that said, I want to fully commit in the next year or two and get a Tesla. But I am not sure which is the right model. I have 3 small children between 11 and 3. 2 are in front facing car seats too. I have looked into the model 3 LR as the most practical financial option but the Y might have more rear room? I\u0019m not sure. And I\u0019m not sure if a used X would be worth it (I know they\u0019d have the room but I do not know if too old of one is worth the risk of mechanical issues (battery specific). Financially I can do anything up to the 60k range too. My current car is 75% paid off already.",

Note that all data is pulled from Tessie.\n\nDuring a 49 period where the car was parked inside an empty storage unit, it managed to drain 10.8 KWH of battery. While sentry mode was on, it was still inside a completely walled storage unit, so sentry mode never triggered, nor did cabin temp protection kick in(never went above 20 degrees Celsius).\n\nAdditionally, Tessie reports that my average fuel efficiency is only 60%. At 80% battery charge, my expected range is 258 miles, yet my real world range is only 150.\n\nIs it normal for your actual range to be halved of what Tesla expects it?\n\nThis car was originally from a rental company and has a total of 76000 miles, 75000 before I got my hands on it.\n\nIs this a potential issue that warrants a service appointment, or is this expected behavior for an EV?",

I'd say I'm driving about 2,000km per month.\n\nI don't necessarily need a new car, however, Tesla has recently dropped the prices of their Model 3 RWD to $54,990 in Canada which now makes them eligible for a federal rebate of $5,000.

Electricity here is $0.13/kWh.\n\nI'm #3 on the waitlist for the new Toyota Prius Prime but my dealer said not to expect anything until 2024. I would still prefer to have a plugin hybrid just for the flexibility and since the charging network isn't that extensive in New Brunswick yet. Although if I were to get the Tesla, I'd charge at home.\n\nFinances are good. The only reason I started looking at hybrids and EVs recently was due to the spike in gas prices last year. I'm not a fan of wasteful spending and since my Acura has 3.7L engine that powers an AWD system, it's not exactly fuel efficient.\n\nSo, thoughts?

      "text": "Okay so here is my situation. I am interested in purchasing a Tesla model 3 SR+ when my current lease is over but im afraid my credit isn't good enough. I currently have a car lease and another car that i helped cosign . My car lease is up in may but the person still owes about $7.5 K on the other vehicle. My current credit score is about 640. My current car lease was for $30K, and i have had a car purchase before for $24K which is the car that was refinanced and now has $7.5K on the loan, but during both those times someone helped me cosign. I am trying to buy this vehicle by myself  and im not sure if i will be able to get another cosigner for this vehicle. I am not getting any fancy bells and whistles. Just basic color and interior.   I am from California so i see they have a $1500 fuel reward.  I know this is a lot to ask but what are your thoughts, recommendations, or anything you can suggest that i should try to do to have a chance to purchase the vehicle. THANK YOU !",

Is getting a Tesla Model 3, they're one of the cheapest rental options even including gas vehicles, or should I just get a regular Camry or Mazda? Would the Tesla save me any money on fueling or the hassle of not having a home charger and only relying on public charging be a deal breaker? There's a supercharging station nearby my office, I figured I could work out and the gym and charge the car, and be set for the week. Or there's one at Whole Foods. Both I wouldn't even need to kill time theoretically it would just charge while I'm doing the errand I would be doing anyway. How much would the supercharging cost?

The idea is to objectively evaluate  the buy decision to go BEV vs ICE. At this point, EVs remain a luxury for the average person.\n\nToday, EVs make up less than \\~1.5% of total cars on the road. Thanks to induced demand due to blind government policies is going to make sure everyone will be riding a bike in the not far future.\n\nI am all for electrification provided it makes sense, what ever your reason, be it financial, environmental or pure bragging rights.\n\nIt's easy to focus on the fuel costs and push one opinion. However, for sake of the analysis the breakeven point for ICE vs BEV  happens @ 54.4¢/kWh\n\nIn California, for example, average kWh cost 30¢/kWh and with the current trajectory, it wont' take time before it hit 60¢/kWh...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT#2:**\n\n\\- added Chevy Bolt for those who are looking at other EV option\n\n\\- At face value, the Bolt comes on par with Corolla. However, this is only because of blind government policies and subsidies using your tax dollars. Those incentives are not going to last long.\n\n\\- Today, battery (65kWh) replacement cost would run you \\~17.5k cad\n\n\\- Battery costs and EVs are likely to increase over the next decade. Thanks to EVs rush.\n\nif you divide battery replacement cost  by average annual fuel cost for ICE you get\n\n17.5k/ 2.5k = 7 years pretty much negating any fuel savings\n\n\\- We have not discussed infrastructure bottleneck, grid capacity, MPU for Level 2 charger, inter-city travel, recycle waste, supply chain, geo-political issues, and the list goes on...\n\n\\- All to say, the cost of electricity is likely to sky rocket. So yes, enjoy EVs while you can\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT#3:**\n\nI am not suggesting 0.251 kWh/km is the EV's efficiency.\n\nThe EV efficiency is pretty much constant, i.e. in the case of Tesla it is the available usable capacity (kWh) divide by Range (km)\n\n57.5kWh/438km = 0.131 kWh/km\n\nNow, batteries do age over their lifetime @ \\~4.3%, this means, over the course of it's lifetime, you need to charge your battery more to squeeze the same mileage.\n\nCharging efficiency varies from install to install depending on cable run length and available voltage. A typical Level 2 charger can reach +90% efficiency.\n\nif you take your electricity consumption to charge the battery and divide by the odometer reading, you are going to be closer to 0.250kWh/km. Of course, this assumes you are charging at home.\n\n0.250kWh/km is what it will end up costing you to charge your car\n\nsee this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/152eouj/comment/jshdcmo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for more details\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT#4:**\n\nHere is a real life experience of BEV [WTF moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/158beq7/what_did_i_do_wrong_i_left_it_in_office_garage/)\n\nHere is a [real-life trip of 2,200 miles](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/15pkrga/comment/jw2bonk/)  and charging costs vs fueling costs\n\naverage efficiency:\n\n601kWh/2200mi = 0.272kWh/mi = 0.170kWh/km\n\naverage charging costs:\n\n$223.71/ 601kWh = 37.2 cent/kWh\n\nin contrast, a comparable ICE with 40MPG HWY fuel efficiency\n\n2200mi / 40mpg = 55 gallons\n\n$223.71 / 55gal = $4.05/gal which is slightly more than average gasoline costs of $3.94/gal at the time of the trip\n\n[https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\\_gas\\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nI am all for Electrification and EVs.

      "text": "Let me see if I can do the math correctly. For my particular situation.  \nPlease keep in mind I am just choosing this post to think about my own situation out load. There is no point I am trying to make. I am just sharing my math.\n\nSo my existing vehicle at the time was a Truck that got 14MPG\n\nMy wife's vehicle gets 40MPG\n\nThe Hybrid car I was looking at (users report real world MPG of 50-60-75) So let's call it 55MPG to take a lower estimate. (But knowing the way I drive, I bet I would have gotten 60-70.)\n\nGas in my area has been sub $3 to $3.10 for 3 months now. Electric is about 0.14 per kwh.\n\n2010 Toyota Tundra V8  \n2021 Tesla M3 LR AWD  \n2019 Kia Optima 1.6L  \n2022 Corolla Hybrid\n\nOk let's do Cent per mile\n\nTruck = 0.21  \nTesla = 0.04  \nCar = 0.07  \nHybrid = 0.06\n\nCost for 1 year of fuel at 20k miles (My average.)\n\nTruck = $4,200  \nTesla = $800  \nCar = $1,400  \nHybrid = $1,200\n\nUp Front Cost (Remember for MY situation I don't care about what ifs. this is a thought experiment for me. this also includes interest over 1 year. I pay off my cars in 1 year or less.)\n\nTruck = $0  \nTesla = $30,500  \nCar = $0  \nHybrid = $23,000\n\nCosts for fuel over 3 years (How long I intend to keep my Tesla.)\n\nTruck - $12,600  \nTesla - $2,400  \nCar - $4,200  \nHybrid - $3,600\n\nCost for fuel over 6 years (How long I might keep the Tesla.)\n\nTruck - $25,200  \nTesla - $4,800  \nCar - $8,400  \nHybrid - $7,200\n\nCost for Maint and Repairs over 6 years (Averaged From various cost to own websites.)\n\nTruck - $12,000  \nTesla - $8,000  \nCar - $7,000  \nHybrid - $7,000\n\nAverage cost to own over 6 years\n\nTruck - $37,200  \nTesla - $12,800  \nCar - $15,400  \nHybrid - $14,200\n\nMy cost to own over 6 years\n\nTruck - $37,200  \nTesla - $43,300  \nCar - $15,400  \nHybrid - $37,200\n\nSo it makes more sense for me to keep my Truck at 14MPG than get this Tesla.  \nIf gas prices went up to $4 tomorrow it would still take nearly the full 6 years to break even.  \nTundra - $46,200\n\nSo getting an EV make sense if I NEED to get another car. But keeping the same car even if it gets 14MPG is much less expensive. (And this is a Tundra we are talking about, it probably WILL outlive me. So getting rid of it will almost always be a choice never a need.)\n\nAnd yes going by reports and various metrics. A 15 year old Tundra with 300k will most likely be more reliable than a new Tesla as well. The corolla even MORE reliable.\n\nI got my tesla knowing it was NOT the best financial decision. I should have gone with a hybrid or even an older Corolla or Camry around $15k\n\nIf I installed solar it would cost at least $30k for a system that could zero my electric bill. It would make the Tesla a MUCH better deal As I would break even on Solar in about 7 years, but keep benefitting from the \"Free\" electricity\n\nThen when I got another EV that would help as well.\n\nSo i think EV math makes more sense over the course of 7+ years. But under 7 years I think I am losing money on this choice.\n\nOk all done. Please point out any failings in my math. I am sure I messed a bunch up.",

      "text": "Joined this sub recently but have been following Tesla for a while now and I feel the price has never been this great (even though its due to a lot of external factors) so want to get a few thoughts in to aid my decision making process. Currently own (finance) a 2022 Honda Accord Hybrid EX-L which has 25K miles on it - love the car but always wanted to get on a Tesla and was waiting for the right time to get on. So planning to trade/sell based on the following cost considerations:  \n\n\n* Upfront: I have $20K left on the loan and the best offer I have is $32K (purchase price: $39K after tax). Scored a killer 1.9% APR and best I can get for Tesla is just under 4.5%. Plan is to use at least $10K as down payment and majority of the tax rebates (I fully qualify for $7.5K Fed + $2K State) towards a quick pay off to offset the high APR cost. Plan to go for the Model 3 RWD which is at a 39K pre-tax.\n* Cost per mile: Daily commute 50 miles and in CA. Model 3 approximates 5 cents/mile vs the Accord's 12 c/mile and this is strictly based on charging/fuel costs. Need some insight on maintenance but strictly on fuel - the savings look considerable over a period of 5 years.\n* Long-term value: Not much difference from data that is available online but skeptical that the Accord might edge it given the design refresh that's coming out soon.\n* Charging: Plan is to have a Level 2 at home and also have 3 months of SC free if I order in 10 days. My Accord gives a 43.5 mpg consistently. Have seen in this sub that Model 3 is a no brainer with home charging.\n* Ride Quality: Have tried the Model 3 over a few demos and from friends - slightly prefer Accord's ride better but have heard EVs drive the same at Mile 1 and Mile 120K.\n\nEven though Tesla outright wins in the Tech/software department - does it make sense financially to make the switch given the long-ish commute and other factors? Are there some other obvious factors that I might be missing? Looking for some insight from folks who have made a similar switch.",

I live in Dubai and my work used to be in Dubai, I bought a Tesla model 3 2021 long range to save fuel during this fuel price crisis. Unfortunately, my work was tranfered to another emirate and I cannot change my home location due to some personal reasons. Anyways, I drive around 260 KMs per day ONLY for work. After some calculations I found out that I will lose my Tesla warranty in less than half of its period (less than 4 years due to reaching the warranty millage), and I am talking about the battery/motor warranty milage. Also I am living in an apartment which only allows me to charge with the 13 amp connection (I cannot fix a tesla wall charger). And there isnt any chargers on my way except 1 super charger and I dont wanna use it every single day since it will degrade the batteries over time. Also once the warranty is finished, my car price will drop significantly. My tesla can go for 450 +/- km on a full charge. So i was thinking to sell the tesla and buy a fuel efficient heavy duty car like a camry for instances, because I feel i am depreciating the tesla way too fast and i am scared from the maintenances costs after I lose the warranty in a very short time.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "A couple weeks ago my Model 3 started having issues with Autosteer and Steering assist.  I would get this message daily.  Called Service and was told that it's usually just that the car didn't fully go to sleep and that i could reset it with a full Power Down through the service menu.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xn6tvj17no31.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95525ed05b2693f58fd1e65f1ebc92be22ca34f2\n\nThis worked, but the message would re-appear. did this for a couple days until i was backing out of a parking spot and the wheel suddenly jarred and rotated about 45 degrees, and  the screen lit up with a bunch of new messages.  \n\nI completely lost power steering at this point...it was like driving a dump truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrsn2b338no31.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62b56d4b0574c4d5da32cd8dd9a8fc98e4ee4208\n\nThe meme was complements a co-worker who was with me when when this happened.   Ironically enough, I'm an Engineering Manager for a fuel system development and manufacturing company for automotive, so i was supporting the competition and our eventual demise as a plastic gas tank supplier when i bought a full electric.   For all of this to happen while we were driving to a meeting to review fuel system testing was poorly timed, but we couldn't help to laugh at it all.  \n\nThe car was really not safe to drive at that point so i got a hold of roadside assistance, they had it towed from Troy MI to The service center in Toledo, OH.  Tesla arranged for a loaner car (when ended up being a gas guzzling Yukon ).  Despite the loaner vehicle, i was fairly satisfied that this service experience was going to go fairly well...until i reached out to the Service center to arrange to get the car sent back to Troy\n\nI have only been able to contact the shop in Toledo via Texting...i have tried going through tesla service and they couldn't even get a hold of a person to speak to at the shop.   So when i asked about having the car towed or transported back to me I was pretty dismayed to be told that i was on my own to get the car which is 120 miles away.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qf6as59bno31.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5753fa551c20b3b2798b8738667114af436c854e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a concern of mine when i was thinking about making the jump to Tesla... I knew that there was a high chance the car could need to be serviced and being that there are no service centers in Michigan.  BOTH of the Tesla representatives i spoke with (Troy, MI Tesla Gallery, and the Cleveland Lyndhurst Dealership where the car was purchased) told me that Service and warranty items are very convenient and handled by roadside assistance.  \"They will get your car towed to the service center, provide you with a loaner until they return your vehicle to you\" \n\nI reached out to the Roadside Group again this afternoon and they did not even know how to handle this.  They could not get ahold of the local shop, and had to rely on sending emails hoping that something will be resolved tomorrow.  \n\nWondering what other's experiences are like in States that don't have Tesla Dealers or Service centers?  \n\nI am thoroughly unimpressed with the experience so far....I hope Tesla get's their act together and makes this right, but from what i'm reading in other posts. their customer service is a joke.",

Originally I was looking at Hybrid vehicles like the Sonata 23, Elantra, Camry, Prius, etc.\n\nMy price range is about $30K. The hybrids I was looking at were basically starting out at that price, with no government incentives (Illinois apparently dont consider hybrids or plug-in's).\n\nThen my boss told me about the price drop of the Tesla's. \n\nHe is a pretty enthusiastic Tesla owner of a Model Y (he was pissed about the price drop, having bought his a year earlier). I started doing some thinking and looking at the price. $39-40K right now and with the government incentive of -$3750 since I missed out on the full $7500 government incentive March deadline.\n\nIt is a little out of my range but.....\n\nMy questions are:\n\nAfter months or years with your Tesla Model 3, how is it? Has the whole no maintenance / oil change thing been that big of an improvement? \n\nWith the price drop, I'm sure even with the lower amount of incentive, not having to pay for gas moving forwards would balance out the additional upfront cost of the car itself. Is it worth it in your eyes?\n\nWould any of you regret your decision? Do any of you wish you'd have gone the hybrid or plugin hybrid route? What are your thoughts?\n\nI dont care about the whole political crap with Elon. I just want something fuel efficient and pleasant to drive.",

      "title": "First Year Ownership Experience and Review From The Perspective of a BMW Enthusiast",
      "text": "I have had my Model 3 for 1 year 10 months and 11 days. This post is long overdue. \n\nThough I am a relatively young driver at 26, the Model 3 is the most satisfying car I\u0019ve owned and one of my all-time favorites to have ever driven. That is not to say that the experience has been 100% positive. Moving from my 2015 3 Series to the Model 3 had little to no learning curve, but the refinement the Bimmer offered is noticeably absent. The following comparison best represents my experience coming to terms with the Model 3's features, personalities and quirks. \n\n**Exterior Styling**\n\nAggressive lines and large grills&where would we be without them? In a time where car designs are edgier than an angsty teenager, the clean flowing lines of Tesla\u0019s vehicles are a welcome sight. That\u0019s not to say I\u0019ve always felt this way. When the Model S got its facelift, I protested. When the Model 3 was unveiled, I swore it off due to its duck-lips-like front facia. The Model 3 just didn\u0019t look like a conventional car. Then again, isn\u0019t that the paradigm Tesla is working to uproot? The BMW now blends right into the crowd. From behind I\u0019d almost mistake the 2020 redesign for a Lexus. Almost.\n\n**Interior Design &amp; Finish**\n\nAs for the interior...well...it\u0019s somewhat of a tossup. Each get equal points for styling either for Tesla\u0019s take on the \u001cApple approach\u001d of elegant simplicity or the BMW\u0019s sense of familiarity and class. Yes, there\u0019s a lot of buttons and walnut but it\u0019s such an accommodating and inviting cabin. On Tesla\u0019s approach, I find the openness and natural light lends to a more relaxing environment. I love them both. \n\nNow let\u0019s talk about materials. Tesla\u0019s vegan \u001cleather\u001d disappoints only in the mind. I find the material much more satisfying to touch and feel when compared against the Napa leather seats I had in the Bimmer. They\u0019re also much more comfortable to sit in but they SORELY lack support when cornering. The rest of the cabin is also much more pleasant to touch in the Tesla where the BMW had some cold hard plastics in places it shouldn\u0019t have. \n\nHowever, premium materials and build-quality aren\u0019t mutually exclusive. Tap the various panels and compartments in the BMW and you\u0019ll find them satisfyingly solid where the Tesla is hollow. Sometimes too hollow. The upper interior panels of the doors in my 3 for example have far too much flex as does the headliner above the driver\u0019s seat. Don\u0019t get me started on the piano black center console. \n\n**Driving Dynamics**\n\nWhere the BMW is definitely the driver\u0019s car centered around the experience and connection with the road, the Tesla skips or misses the same level of engagement and response. That\u0019s not to say the driving dynamics are any less satisfying, but the experience\u0014exhilarating or otherwise does itself at times feel simulated. \n\nBMW: Sir, the outside wheel is slipping. We\u0019re about to go sideways. Shall we proceed?\n\nTesla: I\u0019ve corrected your mistake and allowed the rear to kick-out within manageable parameters. Wasn\u0019t that fun.\n\nIn the end, despite their fundamentally different behavior, I find them equally ready to be both the daily driver and the weekend warrior. \n\n**Technology**\n\nCars have become increasingly connected and complex machines. Tesla has a history of designing their automobiles from the ground up to be so much more. However, I find the more intriguing question to be whether or not it\u0019s as affective as it is disruptive. Is car culture ready for Autonomous Driving and the Tesla touch?\n\nWhile the Bimmer shamelessly outclasses the Tesla in equipment options, the Tesla holds a clear edge with its potential. Yes, there\u0019s no gauge cluster. There\u0019s \\*almost\\* no buttons and no tactile response. You WILL get over it. Touchscreens were a foreign concept when the iPhone first came out. Now, they\u0019re second nature.\n\nThis is not to say that Tesla\u0019s execution and adoption of Technology are perfectly implemented. Basic creature comforts are missing with no clear indication of why. There\u0019s no CarPlay. No routing options to avoid highways. No ventilated cooled seats. No HUD. No powered trunks. \n\n**Cost of Ownership**\n\nOne of the first things on anyone\u0019s mind when my Tesla comes up in conversation is its environmental and economic benefits. I\u0019ll admit that neither of these factors had much of an influence on my purchase, but I did make an effort to track these costs. As I have a daily commute of about 13 miles, I am able to easily top off with a 120v charger connected to a Currant smart outlet that monitors usage in real-time and provides a monthly report. \n\n2019 Tesla Model 3 AWD \n\nFuel: $545.04 (3,893.17 KWh @ $0.14c/KWh)\n\n Maintenance: $137.49 \n\n Repairs: $2,916.80 \n\n Insurance: $2,022.72/yr\n\n **Total: $5,622.05**\n\n2015 BMW 328i \n\n Fuel: $1,575 \u0013 estimated (20 MPG @ 3.50/gal for Premium)\n\n Maintenance: $283.99\n\n Repairs: $1,009.94\n\n Insurance: $1,887.60/yr\n\n **Total: $4,756.53**\n\n**Service Experience**\n\nTesla\u0019s service experience leaves A LOT to be desired. Facilities are few and far between with exceedingly long wait times. Service centers can\u0019t be reached by phone and the only way to communicate with a service advisor is via text.  I have had to wait an average of 6 weeks for body work and 1-2 weeks for general service and maintenance requests. Avoid damaging your car at all costs. \n\nMy experience with BMW\u0019s service centers was exceptional. My service advisor went above and beyond to be available and accommodate requests on my schedule. Repairs were carried out quickly, but did have one return visit for an issue that could have been easily avoidable. \n\n**Summary**\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Tesla\u0019s Model 3 and hope that those on the fence at least keep an open mind when shopping for their next vehicle. You'll experience some growing pains, but the convenience of fitting an Electric vehicle into your life might just surprise you.",

      "text": "Good morning everyone, swiss fellow here.\n\nI've always been a fan of EV vehicles and Tesla in general, but in the last months I've acquired some financial \"plus\" in my life and was contemplating the idea to switch from my first car (SEAT Leon 2013) to a Tesla M3 LR. I've read a lot, and I mean A LOT, about Tesla in general and moreover on the M3. So I have a few questions that I would be grateful if a Tesla/M3 User could actually help me with, even better if he's Swiss as he knows about EV chargers and so on...\n\nSome background for info: I'm 22YO (M) and I'm an accountant. I live in an apartment and probably in 1, max 2 years I'll go to live together with my fiancee.\n\n1)My biggest worry: range. I'll probably do 20-30 KMs a day for travelling from and to work + maybe 100/150 kms a week for groceries, shopping, friends etc...   \nI'm a 12k KMs/year guy. The range of the M3 is set to 614KM which I know effective are probably 450? 500 max? My question is: if I'll be living in a rent, and there will be no charger, is it really that bad? Or I can live without it and charge it maybe in the weekends in a supercharger (the closest is like 20-30 mins)?\n\n2)How does it feel driving? Does it really live up to the expectations? I read a lot of reviews, some saying it's a bit too clunky and some saying it's the best car they've ever driven. So I'm a little bit lost here.\n\n3)The display. I've seen videos where the fludity of the display was in a very bad state, like some iPad from 2010. Is it really the state of it or is it due to wrong use/outdate?\n\n4)Living in a not-so-big city, there aren't a lot of EV chargers around: if I would be obliged to charge it every week at a Supercharger, would it be a bad thing? wouldn't it be a nonsense considering I'm leaving the fuel also for its price?\n\n5)Wheels. I've read somewhere that they worn out pretty quickly and they cost a lot as they're 18\". Is this true?\n\n6)Engineering. I've seen a lot of posts, especially here on reddit, where some users would receive the delivery and find some little manufacturing errors. Is it really that common or you have to be unlucky?\n\n7)In general, people who switched from Fuel to EV: is it really worth it? Not just for the price, more like in general. Is it too early? Wouldn't it be better to wait a bit like 3-5 years?\n\nI've finished. Sorry for the long post and thank you to anyone who will reply!",

Any car maker that thinks it's all about the battery won't be able to make the transition, and that's most of them. It's not about the battery. It's about driving a car that knows things it can and should know about where it is and what's going on. A car that prevents you from hitting the car in front of you at a stop light. \n\nCar companies should have been inventing these features for years. But their idea of luxury is wood, leather, a $375 key fob and a sport mode. Some luxury cars have some of these features.

So yeah, this is a post about super cold winter driving.\n\n*Equivalent to approx 14mpg, at $1.33/L for fuel.\n\nMy 2007 Mazda 3 would have done this trip for $130-$150 (I know, I've traveled many winters with my Mazda).\n\nDrove from Regina to Saskatoon twice for $300. Insane :'(.\n\nIn the summer I can arrive in Saskatoon at around 30%, charge once, and come back to Regina at around 30%, then charge again. That would cost about $75 for 500km driving ($150 for 1000km) Equivalent to about 43mpg. Still not great, especially when people say Tesla's get over 100 MPGe LOL. So $150 vs $300....\n\nAnd another thing. At 1000 km, Tethla says I used 327kWh. Which at $0.60/kWh, equals $196. So I spent over $100 to warm up and precondition the car/battery???\n\nHaving a garage and exclusively using a L2 charger at a reduced rate is where the savings are. But that doesn't work for road trips...... And not every power company offers reduced rates during certain times of use.\n\nI love and hate Tesla.",

I looked at my home usage over the last 2 years, figured out a good pre TM3 benchmark and figures I would take a couple months more to see what my increased usage w an EV would be (I only charge at home). Long story short, the 3 weeks I had w the 20% less fuel efficient Model S totally threw off my expectation for solar panel coverage and made me realize how awesome it is to have a super efficient RWD TM3 (although slightly less fun acceleration).",

I love a reasonably loud turbo car, and the M2 has valves to make it loud when you want and quiet when you need it to be. Just a lot more aftermarket support and generally a lot more can be done because it has an engine.\n\nI did a weighted decision matrix, and even after adding a ton of categories that benefit ICE, the Tesla still won. However, where I'm at is that my heart says BMW and my brain says Tesla.\n\nAnyone else struggle with this?",

      "text": "So, I\u0019ve been interested in Teslas since I first heard about them in 2014 or so, just been out of reach financially. In 2019 I went to my local gallery and test drove a Model 3 with friends and ever since I\u0019ve got the bug. When my car died in 2020, I didn\u0019t think it was feasible to have a EV at that point, but my credit got to the point I could actually finance a new car. Went with a 2020 Toyota Prius AWD-e. It\u0019s been a workhorse, as my previous prii were. But with gas going up again, it\u0019s getting pricy having to fuel it every day/other day (I drive a lot). Even at 45-55mpg depending on the time of year, $20-$25 3-5 times a week ads up, and with my off peak electric cost at home it would only be like $6 to charge up when needed.\n\nI\u0019ve been eying the nice improvements that have been made in the past few years (heat pump, power trunk, revised center console, heated steering wheel, blacked out trim, etc), and almost pulled the trigger on a lfp SR+ these past few weeks. But of course the prices are high right now, and the config I would want (grey color with 18\u001d wheels and black interior) wouldn\u0019t be delivered until October. Would give me time to prep by having a 60 amp breaker and wiring ran out to my detached garage (about 100\u0019) once the ground thaws, install wall connector, and new garage door with opener. Probably looking at ~$1000 right there easy.\n\nBeen looking at used, and a nice 2018 LR RWD is a available local-ish, direct from Tesla. Previously repaired, and almost 100k miles though. But it would come with homelink and the 14-50 adapter being a older model I think.\n\nIf I were to go the used route, would be getting a aftermarket power trunk/trunk mod, and all the Jeda products. I\u0019m actually torn over the chrome delete, both look nice to me and the chrome door handles would stand out against the black paint making the doors easier to open I think. Not interested in FSD, and neither a new or used model comes with it without paying more.\n\nSo are all the upgrades worth getting a new model over used? Or should I stick with the Prius until it\u0019s paid off? Either way, would be financing the Tesla, and don\u0019t really want to to take on a second car note. Could do it and make the Prius a Turo car or something. I know Tesla has suspended trade ins, and you can\u0019t really trade in a car you\u0019re financing until it\u0019s paid off anyway.\n\nJust looking for advice really as to what my next move will be.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I do have a old Nema 10-5-0 outlet in my basement (there used to be a oven down there years ago when my grandparents owned the place) on my driveway side I could use for level 2, would need to buy a 10-50 to 14-50 adapter and a extension, which I found a combination for about $120 on Amazon, 20\u0019 10-50 extension and adapter, plus 20\u0019 on the mobile connector should be long enough, there\u0019s a window not too far from the outlet, could run it thru there temporarily.",

I\u0019m an expat, so fear of huge repair bills if things break down or age just bother me\n\nI\u0019ve booked a preowned \u001821 M3LR, Grey/White-interiors/Aero, about 70k kms on the odo.\nNo access to home-charging.\n\nWhat are some of the top things to know about the move in general?\n\nSome of the things that are on my mind:\n\n\n- not a fan of the aero wheels, thinking of getting 18\u001d uberturbine but it\u0019s costing a bunch to be delivered to Dubai from EU/US\n\n\n- white vegan leather - any maintenance tips?\n\n\n- were you able to adapt to charging outside of home? (bit spoilt in Dubai, as we have fuel on delivery service at no additional cost) \n\n\n- battery health in Dubai-like high temperatures, does it have any negative impact? what if the car is parked without shade during the day office hours \n\n\n- the car is basically going out of general warranty in 5000kms, so I NEED to make sure everything is in good condition so I don\u0019t have a repair bill that could have been avoided \n\n\n- M3LR surely has 300-500k kms or more driven cars with a healthy battery degradation. But I worry about the battery going wrong post warranty and essentially losing the near full value of the vehicle. Do ya\u0019ll plan to keep until eternity or until a regular upgrade OR sell forcibly before 1-2 years of battery warranty expiry?",

      "text": "Hey everyone. As a fairly recent Tesla owner, one of the biggest hurdles I had before purchasing was the worry of charging and battery health drainage. While I now know how little there is to worry about, I was very much worried about the warnings about Tesla battery repair costs and poor mileage. There's a lot of misinformation on the web about EVs, but not as much actual data from consumers about their battery health and range.\n\nFor that reason, I think having a mega thread or post where all of us post our model type and year, mileage, battery health, efficiency, and IRL miles would help counteract the incorrect stereotype on the web.\n\nLet me start\n\nI drive a 2022 Model 3 LR Dual Motor \n\nI have 80k miles and 94.1% battery health, which means I have an effective battery capacity of 73.2KWh\n\nMy fuel efficiency is 257WH/Mile\n\nWhich means my IRL range is 289.3 Miles per charge.\n\nAnd finally, I have 484.9 charge cycles so far.\n\nHow are your cars doing?",

I understand that Tesla\u0019s don\u0019t need a traditional annual service like your typical ICE car, and that certain filters are due to be replaced every X amount of years. Asides from this, does a Tesla need an intervalled \u001cservice\u001d/health check? If so, when would such a thing be due and what kind of costs could I be expecting? \n\nOn a side note - I generally cover around 350 miles per week, could charging overnight on a 3 pin household socket be viable for me?\n\nThanks",

Can anyone weigh in on this who has gotten the CVAP applied? I know that the CFR and CVRP are taken off of the bottom line total, so you\u0019d till pay full-price sales tax.\n\nAdditionally, CVAP offers a $2,000 prepaid card for EV charging, which I will be taking advantage of once I take delivery. You have to wait 60 days after taking delivery with a CVAP credit before applying for the prepaid charging card. I\u0019ll provide updates as my progress moves along.",

      "text": "Current Vehicle gets average 16mpg at average cost of $4/g for mid grade.  I averaged 1337 miles/month over the last 2 years.  Cost to fuel is approximately $336/mo. or $4,000/year. Current payment $578/mo. at 2.4%, insurance is $150/mo.\n\nModel 3 long range priced currently at $44,880. (I qualify for $7,500 Fed credit, $5,000 state credit, $500 charge install credit, and $500 referral credit).  Monthly would be approx $600 before tax, and insurance would be $200.  Electricity cost for same mileage would be approximately $800/yr.\n\nNetting out all the numbers, monthly cost would be roughly $194 or $2,300/year less with the Tesla.  This part makes sense.\n\nThe issue: From what I gather the Model 3 depreciates very slowly for a vehicle.  The numbers above are using Tesla's current 6.1% rate at 84 months.  I shopped a number of banks and credit unions, and could not find a better rate (credit score is &gt;800).\n\nIf I want to take advantage of the current price/incentives, without increasing (actually decreasing) monthly vehicle expense, does it make sense to enter the deal with Tesla's 84 month option, and plan on refinancing when rates drop?  This sounds dumb to me - but I'm not sure why.  (I do realize I could decrease the term and increase the monthly expense to break even with current expense, and that this would be prudent.  I guess I am looking at this as a sort of middle ground, but having trouble with the 84 month thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "text": "I pulled the trigger on putting down a deposit for a new Model 3 Highland a few weeks after the official reveal. Have been thinking of EVs for awhile but the price tag and design have always been major deterrents. Tesla Model 3 pricing in my country was super compelling, at half the price of similarly spec-ed EVs, mainly due to tax benefits. After watching a few videos on youtube and some quick research, decided to pull the trigger. \n\nFor context, I do enjoy driving, but not necessarily an enthusiast. Currently own a G20 BMW 330i, and used to own a PHEV F30 BMW 330e. My current car does put a smile to my space when I floor it from time to time. The planted feeling when cornering in my BMW at high speeds feels amazing. Just some of the few reasons why \n\nThe main reason for my decision to switch to an EV is mainly for fuel savings. My beamer is quite the gas-guzzler, and my estimations put fuel savings at a few hundred bucks a month. I am able to install a charger at home (which Tesla is giving out for free), so I won't have to rely on public chargers.\n\nAnd the second reason being that at the price, the Tesla Model 3 appears to offer quite compelling value, considering the Highland's upgrades all around. Of course I have reservations - no stalks (not exactly a dealbreaker I guess) and no USS! (most worried about this, but I pray software can improve its reliability). Also not to mention any issues that could be discovered with this facelift version as more drivers test it in the real-world. \n\nAs I am approaching delivery day, I am oscillating between excitement (new car, first EV, novelty of a Tesla) and buyer's remorse (EV???, downgrade in terms of build quality?, no USS!). \n\nThoughts would be helpful, but I most likely will go through with it. \n\nWill do an update on delivery and my first 1000 km!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

In our current vehicle we fuel up about every 2.5 weeks and it generally says it gets about 338-340 miles per tank, so allegedly comparable to the LR. Should we expect to charge about as much as we fuel up?\n\nI guess what I\u0019m looking for is are there others in our situation, and if so how often do you find yourself charging if not daily? \n\nSince we\u0019re in a garage we\u0019d likely not use sentry or anything like that so hopefully battery drain would be relatively minimal outside of actually driving \n\nThanks all for the help!",

      "text": "[EV Hybrid Comparison spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k1pjTIgYo4nfhJzqTU51JLMg78q_G7tO18ShBceiJcA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI was spending the past couple of months running the numbers between owning a efficient hybrid versus a used budget EV. And my conclusion is that unless you have very cheap home charging or consistent free public charging and drive a lot of miles per month, more than 1500. The hybrid is a better choice.\n\nOn the calculations for the hybrid, I chose a Corolla hybrid new version. I live in California so the gas prices is around $5 a gallon. I tried to keep the cost of maintenance, insurance, repairs, fuel costs roughly consistent. \n\nFor the EV, I chose a Tesla Model 3 used. Because currently you can get a used evade that cost under $25,000, at least 2 years old, if you qualify, you get $4,000 off. Also with my electricity provider, Southern California Edison, there's an also another $4,000 off of pre-owned electric vehicles if you qualify for the low household income. The cost of electricity is about 33 cents per kilowatt flat rate, and if you use more than 500 kilowatts per month the cost increases to 43 cents. There is also a time of usage rate, TOU-prime, which is 25 cents per kilowatt during off peak hours, but electricity usage during on peak hours which is 4:00 p.m. To 9:00 p.m. Is 63 cents per kilowatt hour which doesn't seem better than the flat rate. \n\nSo in the best case scenario, the upfront cost of the Tesla is significantly cheaper. However the cost per month of ownership is roughly the same and often more than an efficient hybrid, simply due to the fact of high electricity cost, and also very high insurance and renewals fees. Since EV's don't pay for gas they don't pay for the gas tax for road maintenance so the state is trying to put that cost onto the registration fee instead. If electricity costs are low, and you drive a lot per month then it might make sense to get an electric vehicle. But for everyone else a hybrid makes much more sense. \n\nThis also does not take into account that batteries do not last forever, however most car companies offer a pretty long warranty for the battery, 8 years or 100,000 miles. However once the warranty is up, you're out of luck in terms of the battery and you'd have to pay for it yourself. And from my experience from looking online, I rarely see people last that long with their battery, and their battery goes under 70% capacity left. It seems more likely that the high voltage battery just stops working randomly due to bad cells, and stops charging and then people have to get it replaced through warranty, such just a refurbed pack.\n\nSo I think that in summary, if you're getting an EV, you are definitely not saving money, unless you drive a lot of miles amount per day, 80 or more. The main justification for buying an EV is because you like the driving experience of electric vehicles mostly, you don't go on road trips often, and you can charge at home easily.",

      "text": "I've been ogling Teslas for years but now that one of our cars is approaching end of life, we're giving serious thought to purchasing a Model 3.  My wife's work commute is far, so we ideally want something with good mileage. \n\nI have some concerns and doubts. My commute is about 3 miles one way, my wife about 40. We're thinking for my wife to drive the car. \n\nThe standard range is really pushing our budget for what we wanted to spend on a car.  But I figure 140 miles is enough. \n\nThe thing is we also drive some distances on weekends. Between 45-115 miles one way often.  Granted, we have car seats, etc, so likely take the minivan for family trips. \n\nSo the concern would be charging when we get to a destination. \n\nHow accurate is the miles range on the car? I know it fluctuates on a gas car, but we can generally get a good idea. \n\nI can't get solar panels since my house direction isn't optimal for sun. I could get a charger installed, but obviously that helps me only home. \n\nMy other concern is longevity. Obviously it's too early to tell, but we easily put 15-20K miles on a car in a year.  We also ride our gas cars for a good 10 years.\n\nSo I'm trying to work out if the logic makes sense to get a base model 3, maybe even extended drive, or stick with a good fuel efficient car for a while. \n\nKind of rambling questions here. Hope to get some good advice and feedback.",

I started thinking about purchasing a tesla, because i have some money in my savings (10k ¬) and wondering if that would be a good investment, since i havent used that money for 2 years,it is practically losing its value, + the country where I live, the government gives 5k benefit for everyone who wants to buy an electric car. That means I'd need to pay like 30k more in 5 years,which is about 500¬ per month. \n\nWhat do you guys can advise me, in comparison with a diesel or petrol car,does it really cost less to maintain, and should i be looking for a new tesla or a used one with like 100k km on the road (they cost way less)?",

      "text": "Edit: this data is for battery failures (the article notes that the gathered data is either from 12V or HVB) \n\nThe Tesla Model 3 has annihilated its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts in a new reliability study from Germany.\n\nThanks to the incredible mechanical simplicity of electric vehicles, it should come as little surprise that EVs are, on average, significantly more reliable than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts. A new study from a German vehicle analysis firm, the ADAC, highlighted this reliability advantage, finding that the Tesla Model 3 handily beats the vast majority of its gas-powered competition.\n\nThe ADAC study, which primarily focuses on vehicle breakdowns, is an annual study for vehicles that are over three years of age, and it now includes four electric vehicles sold in the German market, including the Tesla Model 3, BMW i3, Volkswagen ID.3, and Renault Zoe. According to the ADAC\u0019s data, electric vehicles not only lead their gas counterparts on average but the Tesla Model 3 beat both gas vehicles and EVs in average reliability by a wide margin.\n\nThe ADAC found that out of 1,000 2020 model-year Tesla Model 3s, only 1.1 vehicles broke down annually, which surprisingly is a slight increase from the 2019 Model 3, which only had 0.9 breakdowns per 1,000 units. Comparatively, the average gas vehicle had 6.9 breakdowns per 1,000 units, and the average EV had 4.9 breakdowns per 1,000 units.\n\nBesides the Tesla, the BMW i3 and VW ID.3 also shined as reliable within the EV segment and their size classes. The cars both scored just 0.2 breakdowns per 1,000 units. However, as noted in the ADAC study, these vehicles may benefit from fewer units on the road, potentially skewing data.\n\nStrangely, looking at the most common breakdown problems, gas and electric vehicles share a common top breakdown reason, dead battery. In the case of ICE vehicles, the study references the starter battery. Still, it remains unclear if this statistic was in reference to the 12-volt battery or the larger vehicle battery found in EVs.\n\n\nSource: \n\nhttps://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/unfall-schaden-panne/adac-pannenstatistik/?fbclid=IwAR0lzVzqPmr3kFK7KxUfXRpMo6EzpZWp5q9aY8h_c1HfudgBmZs3PCJAOfU\n\nhttps://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-crushes-reliability-study/",

Would prefer a MYLR (mainly because i prefer SUVs) but it seems it's more then i would want to get into. I have been 'researching' to why i should get a Tesla and seeing if it would benefit me in the long run.\n \nHere is what I've been going over, my job requires me to drive a good amount of distance (anywhere from 190-256mi from home), have the vehicle parked for two weeks then drive back home and enjoy my week off. Back at home i don't drive much but there are destination chargers and a one supercharger location at a hotel i can use until I get a home charging kit. The commute to work has one station which is 166mi from home. No other charging stations in the towns I work at. \n\nClosest Tesla dealer is 4(+/-)hrs/258mi so if there is some sort of inconvenience it'll be a good drive to have any warranty work done and if i have to leave it, it'll be a while before i can go get it due to my work schedule. I have been thinking of changing careers which would also be away from home,111mi, living quarters not available so more than likely I'll have to sleep in the car during the work week and then go home on my days off. \n\nI would imagine these vehicles are great especially on hwy, but just like all vehicles it depends on how heavy your foot is (which i do have because i like to go fast) that would affect the distance/battery. I also don't like to stop for anything once i hit the road to and from work. Even fueling up takes too much time for me so i would imagine waiting while charging will be a killer. \n\nWith all that, I'm not sure if buying a Tesla would be great for going to work and home, or just leasing one and using it at home. Sorry for the long post, just a conundrum that's been going through my head to see about justifying a Tesla.\n\nThank you",

      "text": "Hello all. I just purchased a used 2018 Tesla Mid Range.  It has 43,000 miles.  I went used because I purchased to save fuel on days I don\u0019t need my truck. So wanted a smaller payment.  My concern is the range degradation.  I am not sure if it is normal for this age and mileage.  At 80% charge I sit at 187 miles of range, and 230 at 100%.  The original range for this model was 260.  I\u0019ve rented a few Teslas (standard, and mid range) on Turo around the same age or older, and it seems those had better range than this. I have until 8pm tonight and return.  I love this car, but should I be concerned over degradation?  And find another?",

To further confuse the situation, when I search for used M3 LR on Autorader, there seems to be two different versions with a different (claimed) range - 348 miles and 389 miles - is this how you can tell which is the refreshed version?

      "title": "What to expect at 100k miles",
      "text": "Hey guys. I just crossed over 100k miles! 2018 M3 LR AWD, 19\u001d wheels, acceleration boost. Here\u0019s some info you can expect.\n\nTL,DR: drive in chill mode, don\u0019t give Tesla service your business, road trips are good (even with base autopilot), expect the squeaks, enjoy the fuel savings\n\n1. Depreciation- my car was worth ~$55k when new in 2018, and it is now worth &lt;$20k, nearly 70% depreciation in 6 years\n\n2. Battery- I bought my M3 at 23k miles, and it reported 280 miles as max range. It now reports 267, which is 86% of its original EPA rating of 310\n\n3. Range- I have never gotten more than ~230 miles on a full battery when road tripping. Part of the reason is I don\u0019t need to go that far between charges, another reason is most of the time when road tripping, the weather was cold.\n\n4. Road trips- since my car is pre-heat pump, I genuinely estimate my wh/mi as 340. The car is EPA rated for 242 wh/mi, but due to the cold and the sport rims, when road tripping in the winter, I get that kind of efficiency. This means in the winter I can expect an 80% range estimate at about 150 miles.\n\n5. Charging- I\u0019ve lived in apartments close to free public chargers for the life of the car, so I have paid very little in charging costs. I estimate my effective charge rate as about $0.06/kwh (including supercharging) or about $1300 in 3 years and 77k miles. Do that in a gas car that gets 30mpg and it costs $7,000\n\n6. Charging (contd)- people are very inconsiderate at public chargers. I imagine this isn\u0019t an issue with a home charging setup, but often in apartment living, you battle self-entitled teslas and chevy volts that don\u0019t move their cars away from the free chargers for days at a time. This has forced me to go to super chargers in the past, costing me time and money\n\n7. Car washes- I\u0019ve only ever used touchless, manual spray washes on the car. As a result, I\u0019ve never gotten crazy scratches all through the paint, and I\u0019ve never had condensation in the lights. I clay and polish the paint once per year. When I detail the interior, everything looks brand new.\n\n8. Service- Tesla service is awful. I had my AC go out, which they estimated as a $400 repair. I asked if they could fix a squeak in my back left wheel (it squeaks loudly when I reverse while turning). They quotes me $600 for everything, and I decided to pay because the sound was annoying. They went in, without my permission, and replaced all 4 brake pads, and some calipers, and charged me $1900\u0013and the service was already completed, so I felt like I had no choice but to pay. Looking back, I\u0019ll never make that mistake again and I\u0019ll laugh in their face. They didn\u0019t even fix the issue, and I\u0019ve been dealing with it for the last 30k miles now. For the rest of my ownership, I will be performing my own repairs or finding a 3rd party to do them. Discount tire can handle alignments, tire rotations, and other wheel services, and squeaks and rattles are just a thing. Just get used to them, or else the service center will make things worse by trying to help.\n\n9. Drive- I come from rural Illinois, and when I was there, the AWD performance was excellent. In snow it was great, and going for a sporty drive with lots of 0-60s was so fun. Now I live in the city in Texas, and there are so many people on the road I can\u0019t gallop! Also, I keep the car in chill now 95% of the time\u0014even normal acceleration in standard/sport causes the tires to spin, and wears them down significantly faster. Base autopilot is great too, you don\u0019t need anything more.\n\n10. Insurance- Tesla insurance is very adaptable. I used to drive 25k miles in a year for work, my premium was $210/mo in TX with a 96 safety score. Now I drive &lt;9k miles per year since I work remote and only sometimes commute 40mi round trip to the office, now my premium is $122/mo with a 99 safety score. It\u0019s the lowest price insurance you can find\u0014if a bit annoying for dinging you for driving past 11pm at night.\n\n11. Accessories- I have 4 accessories with my car. \n-Jeda V4 wireless charger for legacy M3 (gives the original M3 the alcantara charger like the 2021+\n-USB A to USB C adapters for rear\n-A small plastic clip on the driver side visor to prevent it from buzzing and making noise\n-Alcantara center console tray to hold my sunglasses, J1772 adapter, and change\n\n12. Noise- I have one of the unfortunate early M3 owners flaws, which is the motor whine issue. Newer cars don\u0019t have this, I believe, but my front motor whines pretty loud when driving. I try to ignore it. Also, when driving on the highway, there\u0019s a whipping sound of the air hitting my driver side mirror- I took it in to service twice for them to fix this, and they did nothing both times. The car creaks when going over curbs and speed bumps. The reversing squeak comes back all the time (the one I had to pay $1900 for that Tesla didn\u0019t fix)\u0014the solution is to go to a manual car wash and blast water into the brake calipers and on the rotors real good. The sound goes away for about 4 weeks. A GOOD noise I hear is the sound system which is amazing.\n\n\nConclusion: If I needed a new car today, I\u0019d think twice about getting a tesla. For the cost of the monthly payment, I\u0019d honestly probably go with an older used Lexus instead\u0014purely because of public charger inconvenience, poor tesla service, and poor tesla quality control. Don\u0019t kid yourself and think Tesla has figured out their quality control\u0014see for yourself that they\u0019re still misaligning doors (ambient lighting issues), their steering wheels are creaking, and there\u0019s condensation under the lights. With an older ICE vehicle, at least you have control over your own service, and for the cost of a $500+ monthly tesla payment, it\u0019d be much easier to own an older car outright in this economy.\n\nI\u0019ll keep the Tesla until it dies. But it\u0019s just a car. And that\u0019s okay. Just lower your expectations.",

      "text": "I own a Model 3 since summer 2019, so almost 3 years. Before that, I owned (relatively cheap) premium German cars (entry-level Mercedes Class C then E) respectively 2 and 5 years. My car is quite important to me: my twice 30 minutes daily commute is the only time I really have for me: during the day, I cope with all the stress of working during the day, and I have to deal with my lovely, and very healthy, children at night. Probably, many fathers feel the same.\n\nWith my previous cars, after owning them less than 2 years, I started feeling the need to shop around and looking for a new car. I do not feel the same need with my Model 3 and here is why:\n\n* Software updates are great. I may have had a few complaints about the latest major change of user interface, but just the fact of changing the interface brings a feeling that my car is new. Adding new video-games here and there (I loved Skyforce, and it was nice to play Sonic again after 30 years) is also a great way to feel good about the car\n* The style of the car does not look dated. While I have some complaints about the interior quality and the sound-proofing, generally, the cars age well, both the outside shape and the interior atmosphere\n* The car comes well equipped by default, so I have no regrets of not choosing, amongst the hundred possible options of my German car, the 10 I will really need for the next 10 years.\n\nSo in the end, even if my LR M3 was a costly purchase, I may keep it for quite long, and this will make it, in addition to low fuel cost and limited maintenance, a quite cost-conscious purchase.",

      "title": "Model 3 LFP Review after 60k miles",
      "text": "Hopefully this post will provide some info/context to anyone considering purchasing an LFP Model 3. I\u0019ll keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI took delivery of my LFP Model 3 on February 21, 2022. I drive a LOT for work, and I chose the Model 3 for the potential gas savings and autopilot. I\u0019ll share my actual savings below as well as degradation and repairs.\n\n**Battery Degradation:**\n\nAs of today, I\u0019ve driven just over 60k miles. I\u0019ve experienced roughly 4% degradation in this time. Brand new, the car showed 272 miles of range. It now shows 261. This has not impacted my daily driving in any way. I charge to 100% every day. Electricity is a flat $0.09/KwH in my area. I live in the south, so winters are moderate.\n\n**Range Anxiety:**\n\nI would comfortably trust this car for \\~190 miles on the highway at highway speeds (80mph) during the summer. During the winter, 140-150 miles. Far less than the advertised range. For me, I don\u0019t mind stopping every 2.5-3 hours to charge. I would normally stop for bathroom breaks and to stretch my legs, so this isn\u0019t a huge deal to me. That being said, if money were no object, I would go with the long range. More for the charging speeds than range. This car is limited to 170KW supercharging, while long range models can charge at 250KW. Faster charging would be nice.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nRepairs are minimal with this car, but I\u0019ve had a few.\n\n1: The most significant issue was a drive unit failure. The car just suddenly failed on me during a road trip - I couldn\u0019t drive the car at all. Thankfully this occurred while parked. I had to get the car towed to the nearest service center (90 miles away). Took Tesla about 3 weeks to fix. They paid for the repair and my rental car during this process. No issues since.\n\n2: I\u0019ve had the seal repaired on both front windows three separate times. I was experiencing significant wind noise, and replacing the window seals has yet to fix the issue completely; it\u0019s \\~ 80% better, but I suspect the front windows are misaligned on the track within the door, causing an imperfect seal when fully rolled up, thus causing wind noise at high speeds. Not an issue for city driving. I\u0019ve decided it\u0019s no longer worth trying to fix and I just deal with it.\n\n3: I\u0019ve replaced tires once in 60k miles, costing roughly $1600. I didn\u0019t rotate tires properly during this period causing my back tires to wear rapidly. Tesla recommends rotating tires every 6000 miles or so.\n\n4: I had the back glass replaced due to a rock cracking it. \\~$800 repair.\n\n5: not technically a repair, but it cost me $1300 to have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet at my house. My mobile connector was included with the car at the time of purchase, but Tesla no longer includes these for free. This will add \\~$250 to your charging installation cost.\n\nNow onto savings. My previous vehicle was a 2014 Ford Fusion Energi (plug in hybrid) which got around 40mpg when running in hybrid mode. Over the last year according to the Tesla app, based on gas prices in my area and my previous car\u0019s MPG, I\u0019ve saved around $2200. Not quite the savings I was looking for, but if you\u0019re switching from a less fuel efficient vehicle your savings would be better. Gas is roughly $3.20 in my area as of Sept 18th 2023.\n\n**Things to consider when purchasing:**\n\nI live in a small town, and none of my local tire shops will accept any Teslas for tire rotations. The nearest Tesla service center is two hours away. This won\u0019t be an issue for me 99% of the time, but for any repairs larger than a tire rotation, I would have to drive two hours to have my car worked on. Thankfully, Tesla mobile service alleviates most issues. I can have my tires rotated for around $70 with mobile service. (Yes I will be doing this myself in the future, I\u0019ve since purchased the required tools)\n\nTLDR; After 60k miles, I\u0019ve experienced 4% degradation in my Model 3 LFP. 272mi -&gt; 261mi. I charge to 100% every day. I\u0019ve experienced range anxiety one time in 60k miles, but I drive an abnormal amount. Repairs have been minimal. Best car I\u0019ve ever owned, but if I could do it again I\u0019d get the long range for faster charging speeds.",

      "text": "I finally made the switched to an EV and picked up my beautiful new blue M3.  Some notes from my first day using the car that could help any other first timers to the Tesla ecosystem.\n\n1.  I was put off by the delivery experience at the dealer as my car was not ready in time.  Had to wait about 25 minutes past my appointment time to finally see my ride.  The worst part is that the battery was only 13% charged, which blew my mind when they told me this.  My first time rollout out with an EV and they throw my into battery anxiety straight.  I have never picked up an ICE car where the fuel wasn't 100% topped up - not a great experience Tesla.  I basically had to find a supercharger 5 miles away to ensure I could get home. \n\n2.  The turn signals are definitely taking some time to get used to.  The way it works when changing lanes is that once your lane change is completed the camera should pick this up and turn off the turn signal, but this only happens about 95% of the time.  I noticed a few times after completing my lane change, the turn signal did not come off and pressing it again does nothing.  I basically had to press the turn signal for the opposite direction to turn it off - so annoying!!\n\n3.  After I did my first quick charge at the supercharger, I then had to revisit again later in the evening only to find out that I am receiving a message that I cannot use the supercharger because of an issue with paying for the charge earlier in the day. I checked my credit card and the payment from earlier went through with no issues, I even checked on the tesla app and it was showed as paid.  After trying to troubleshoot for 20 minutes and trying to find an answer on google/Reddit, I called tech support and they said it was a glitch.  To resolve it I had to go into my profile and reconfirm my mailing address, and that resolved the issue.  It also took forever to get through to an agent. Hopefully this is the last glitch that I ever have to deal with. \n\n4.  The regenerative braking is easy and intuitive.  I read another recent thread where someone simply hated but I found it super easy.\n\n5.  FSD is no where close to optimal.  I only feel comfortable using it when there is very little traffic around.  It made several major mistakes where I had to take over control.  I would really only feel comfortable using it on highway driving with not much traffic.  I will never use it for merging onto or off  highways.  Also I'm finding it a bit jarring when taking control, I have to steer the wheel forcefully at times and it makes the car swerve a bit when it releases control to me.  I'm sure I will figure out a way to do this more smoothly as I get used to it.  ",

      "title": "My 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; AKA whatever the opposite of brevity is. ",
      "text": "Here's my 2024 Model 3 Performance Review; an exercise in word vomit.\n\n**Review context:** Over a decade of driving Audis, a 2019 B9 S5, a 2015 B8.5 S4, and a 2010 B8 A5. The B9 S5 and B8.5 S4 could not have been more different in temperament. The S4, with a 6-speed manual, was an absolute thrill. Pulling to redline was a neck hair standing crescendo of supercharger whine and unadulterated exhaust noise. The B9 S5, with the ZF8 was the polar opposite, a wave of torque that died out above 5k RPMs and an exhaust note that rivalled a belabored wet fart. Don't get me wrong, the B9 was an ultra comfortable highway cruiser, with the capabilities to carve up the twisties, it just really became an appliance to and from work 99% of the time, with 1% side dish of fahrvergnügen. I have a Mk1 Volkswagen to drive for fun, so I didn't really need my daily to be a true driver's experience. The B9 elapsed its warranty, and with the impending prospect of new tires, new brakes, a 50k service, coupled with all the reports of rocker arm failures, I decided it was time to abandon U-boat and apply those funds to something new.\n\n**Ordering Experience / Delivery:** Both the S5 and S4 sort of found me. My Audi sales manager knew my preference for any color as long as it was gray, sport package equipped, late run S cars. He'd often call me when he would have a leftover, typically in the middle of winter, when he couldn't sell a car on summer tires to anyone other than a moron *(me)*. Entire car purchase on both the S5 and S4 took no more than 3 days, and were completely painless. Ordering a Tesla was as far from that process as you can get, granted it was generally what I had expected. I placed my order for the M3P on April 25th after watching the Jason Camissa and Top Gear reviews at 1am. Not being able to \"haggle\" with the dealer, let alone communicate with a human being was strange. The only time I communicated with what I thought was a human *(likely ChatGPT)*, was via Tesla app texts, typically them requesting documents or further ownership info. The estimated delivery date changed no less than 9 times, an Action Park \"Alpine Slide\" of emotions I'd have preferred not to have rode. My trade in estimate expired 3 times, however the trade in value remained the same from 4/24 through my pickup on 7/5, since I did not exceed the allotted 1000 miles. This kept me right-side-up enough to cover T,T,L,A and FMP of the Tesla. Carmax offered me $800 more, but the tax offset made this a pointless endeavor. Delivery was the first time I talked to a human being, a wide eyed late 20 something who clearly consumed entirely too much espresso *(and Elon Koolaid)* before he came to work. At the recommendation of other Tesla owner's I did not sign any final documents, or pay the \"final payment\" until after I inspected the car. I had been expecting the worst during inspection, after reading numerous horror stories on FB and reddit, however the only issue with the vehicle was a scratch on the carbon spoiler, which Tesla will be replacing free of charge at the end of the month.\n\n**Now onto the '24 M3P itself:**\n\n**Exterior / Styling:** I had always had my eye on the pre-Highland M3P, but the lack of differentiation from lower spec models kept me from taking the plunge. I really appreciate the unique front bumper, front splitter, rear diffuser and rear spoiler. I also think the Highland headlights and tail lights look much more refined in their styling. The lack of fog lights is a bummer, but I also felt the same with the lack of fogs on the S5, no biggie. The dimensional comparison between S5 and the M3P are almost identical, albeit the M3P is 2\" taller. I will say, the '24 M3P styling is enough to make me look over my shoulder when I walk away from it. I find the M3P to look aggressive, yet stealth, which is right up my alley. The little features and details do it for me. It's by no means Pininfarina or Giugiaro penned, but I think it has a clean modern aesthetic, especially with the new lights and bumpers.\n\n**Suspension:** Wow. I'm wholly impressed. Where the B9, that also rode on 30 series tires, felt harsh, clamoring over rode imperfections, the M3P feels so well sorted in comfort or sport suspension setting. Someone described hitting a bump in the M3P as \"one and done\" and that could not be more accurate. There is a marked difference between \"comfort and \"sport\", but neither are too far at the end of the spectrum. \"Sport\" definitely increases compression dampening, which influences body roll *(or lack there of)* but remains compliant and comfortable. In comparison, the S5, with dampers set to \"sport\", was liking having shocks filled with portland cement; I used that setting all of 3 times in my 4.5 years of ownership.\n\n**Chassis:** The low center of gravity of the M3P also contributes to the \"on rails\" feeling. Where the S5 window seals would sound like the intro to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\", creaking and groaning entering my driveway, the M3P makes not a peep. This indicates to my Neanderthal brain that the chassis is stiffer, a feat when you consider the entirety of the M3P roof is glass. On one \"bit too enthusiastic\" *(re: entirely too fast)* entry through a concrete paved exit ramp, the coefficients of friction and adhesion were communicated well through the car, the seat, and directly into my clenched *(yet perfectly cooled, more on that later)* derriere.\n\n**Steering:** On my mindless commute, I tend to forget how noncommunicative modern power steering is, however one drive in the Mk1 reminds me the fact that a steering wheel can tell you, in braille, what is is happening at the interface of rubber and road. The M3P and S5 are equally numb; you're feeling so faithless, lost under the surface, you just can't feel it there *(Chester Bennington croons in background)*. Ratio wise, the M3P feels a bit sharper than the S5, especially on turn-in. Turn the wheel, the nose tips in quickly and without drama. Lock to lock, there are less turns in the M3P, but similar resolution and control. In normal driving, the M3P's \"Light\" setting is perfect, for spirited driving \"Medium\" adds just enough preload to keep from being too darty. \"Heavy\" is akin to the the tiller at the helm of Moby Dick's Pequod, entirely too weighty, severely delaying steering inputs. I will likely never use that forearm vein bulging setting, due to the heft, which is pretty incredible when I'm reminded of the fact that the steering rack in the Mk1 has been failing and ejaculating fluid onto my garage floor for the better part of the last 3 years.\n\n**Power:** There is no comparison here. The S4 and S5 were by no means slow cars, I'd even say you could consider them fast when compared to most cars on the road *(F35 catapulted from the deck of a carrier when compared to the Mk1)*. The M3P is otherworldly. Instantaneous torque is an understatement, \"Ohm my f\\*cking god\" is more accurate. Acceleration builds just as quickly as the throttle pedal changes angle. My first time using \"Insane\" mode, which is so aptly named, caught me off guard and strained a muscle in my neck. Passengers have squealed in delight, excitement, and or *(mostly)* fear, gripping the seat base bolsters and door handle to stabilize themselves. I have driven 911 turbos, M3s, M4s, M5 and M8 competitions in anger *(thanks BMW Track Days!),* and while on paper, those cars have similar acceleration times, there is nothing that compares to the rapid torque delivery of an electric performance car. Yellow traffic lights? If you can see it, you can make it before you squeeze the tomato. The M3P is unwavering in pull up to the \\~110 or so miles per hour I've gotten it up to, with no interruptions for gear changes. I have no instrumented documentation, but I fully believe the 2.9 second 0-60 and sub 11 second quarter mile. It is a thrill, even sans a screaming cacophony of internal combustion, however, you are missing the auditory reference point to gauge speed. The acceleration is cocaine level addicting, and I need to keep Randy S. Alpert Esq., my faithful traffic attorney, whom I've previously funded braces for his children's teeth, at the ready on speed dial.\n\n**Interior:** While I dig the minimalist design, I had been having anxiety over a lack of dash cluster since long before delivery, contemplating adding an aftermarket screen to satiate my need for through the steering wheel data. 10 minutes of driving, that need was gone. The speedo at the corner of the main screen is in your periphery and was easy to adjust to. The lack of signal stalks on the other hand took longer to break 25 years of muscle memory to get used to. While the turn signal buttons are easy enough to use with the pad or side of the thumb, I still occasionally find myself reaching for a stalk that isn't there. I won't pontificate on the fact that all controls are through the screen, other than it must be purgatory for anyone aged boomer or above, as you are essentially driving a rolling smart phone. The seats are comfortable, and supportive, but at 6'3\" and 200lbs, I think I am right at the limit of what can fit between the bolsters, which were adjustable on the S5. My brother, a man of oxen-like man, at 5'9\", \\~270, plainly did not fit in the seats and mushed the seat bolsters to my chagrin. With not nearly as many adjustments as the Audi seats, which were awkwardly flat in shape, I was able to easily find a comfortable position in the M3P's contoured and supple seats. The air conditioned seats, which were not available in my Audis, are a welcomed addition to someone that would describe their basal state as diaphoretic. My significant other, whom while wearing a sundress, referred to them as feeling like \"menthol for your labia\" and I cannot stop chortling about that. Fit, finish and materiality is markedly better than the pre-Highland Model 3s I've driven / rode in. I would say I am generally impressed with the interior that is on par with the Audi quality I have become accustomed to. The addition of full acoustic glazing makes it a quiet place to be, though I rarely notice this due to what is underscored in the next section. I will say, I do miss having massaging seats, but I think that's a fair trade for icy angels singing sweet sonnets upon my sweaty taint. The only other cons I can think of are a lack of operable sunroof and a glass roof that allows heat to build in the interior faster than an air fryer can preheat for my late night dino nuggets. Thank the 'Lon for the ability to precondition from my phone.\n\n**Audio:** All 3 of my Audis were equipped with the Bang Olufsen sound system option. They were never impressive, with a lack of bass and a tinny sound that made the money thrown towards that option seem better spent on the aforementioned cocaine addiction. The Tesla in comparison is amazing. Weighty, mirror jiggling, bass, crisp highs; I've yet to find a track that has overextended the speaker cones. Of all the features, the M3 audio system caught me most off guard, I was not expecting such a strong sound system. Thoroughly impressed and soon in need of an audiologist.\n\n**Build Quality:** I guess time will tell here. I can say, the doors close with a satisfying thud akin to the German cars I've owned. Materials feel generally of high quality. The paint finish on the other hand is not of German car quality, with minor, yet noticeable, orange peel when viewed at oblique angles. On my example, panels gaps, while not post-Third Reich tight, are completely acceptable for a car of this price point. However, I can report that on a trip down the drive-thru line at Sonic for cherry limeades, the wheel aero covers make a highly annoying clicking / clacking noise. I will likely remove the covers this weekend. I can also report, the cup holders easily secure 44 fluid ounces of fast food beverage.\n\n**Summary:** All-in-all, I am very satisfied with the M3P. It is a dutiful appliance to get me to work, while still having the power and agility to provide some thrills. In the first 250 miles, I have saved $50 in fuel alone *(thanks free charging at work).* The reviews that led me to take the plunge, in my experience, are completely accurate. If I had to list my biggest complaint, it's the stigma of people thinking I'm an Elon supporter just by driving one. I love the movie \"The Hateful Eight\", does that make me a Harvey Weinstein supporter?\n\nI'll likely edit and add to this, as my fingers and brain fascia have become fatigued, but anyway, thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0imtz7kywbd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f779a4d5db1fd99b2ca22a00c429f88ca12887ca",

      "text": "Last week I wanted to prove to my coworkers and friends that a SR+ Model 3 is more than capable of driving across the country without any worry. So, I decided to drive back to my home state (Idaho) from Virginia, about 2,600 miles each way. And I have some thoughts about the trip. \n\n1.\tAutopilot really takes the mental fatigue away from driving. I\u0019ve done this drive before in an ICE car, and needed days of sleep to fully recover, when I got into Idaho, I went out for dinner with friends later in the day since I wasn\u0019t so mentally exhausted from having to constantly monitor the road. \n\n2.\tI used the car\u0019s built in trip planner and for the most part it estimated my range accurately. Until I got to colder climates, there was stretches that it was confident I could make, and I ended up driving to a closer supercharger since below freezing temperatures and driving 75+mph is going to destroy my range.  \n\n3.\tI was lucky that I got the V10 update before I left. Being able to watch something on Netflix or Hulu while charging made those sessions go by faster. I also would take naps during longer charging stops (1 hour or more) so I could drive throughout the night. I also felt that stopping every 2-3 hours to charge was better in the long run. I never felt as tired as I would be in the Ford I had previously. \n\n\nAll in all, it was the easiest road trip I\u0019ve ever taken. And it cost less than $200 for the entirety of the trip for supercharging. I couldn\u0019t get half way in my previous car before I\u0019d be above that in fuel costs. \n\nThe 3 year long wait from initial reservation to delivery was worth the wait. I love driving again!!",

      "text": "I got my M3 AWD a few days ago and have been doing lots of spirited driving. I've put 600km on the odo so far just driving around town. I used 125kWh for that driving. Based on my experience with a rented Mustang, I would say that comparable spirited driving in an ICE would be at least 14l/100km. That means I would have used 84l of gas at a cost of about $110.\n\nI have the Ontario ultra low overnight rate plan, so the 125kWh cost me $4 with taxes. That's over $100 in savings in less than a week!!! Even the cost of replacing the tires is a rounding error compared to the fuel savings.",

      "text": "I thought I would post about my ownership experience since I have reached 100,000 miles on my 2019 Long Range (dual motor).\n\nI am the 2nd owner and purchased it in May 2021 with 17,060 miles.\n\nCharging costs: $1554\nThis includes supercharging. I am fortunate to have access to a free nema 14-50 plug at my office so I try to charge as much as possible at work. My previous car was a 2018 A6 3.0T and I was spending on average $300 to $375 per month in fuel costs. I would have spent ~$11,000 in just fuel costs on the A6 \n\nEfficiency: lifetime average 272 wh/mi\nI am located in Michigan so this is with cold weather and snow. I run winter tires on the factory aero wheels and 18x9.5 Gram Lights with 265/40 performance tires in the summer. \n\nBattery Degradation: ~11% \nMy current estimated range has been fluctuating from 285 miles to 273 lately. \n\nMaintenance and repairs: \nTires- $1450\nOem tires wore out by 47k miles. My original winters were from my A6 so I got 2 seasons out of those. 265/40 Pilot sport AS4's were just under $1000 and I purchased new pirelli winters $450 (previous year inventory discounted)\n\nGlass- $200 (comprehensive deductible)\nMy roof glass and windshield cracked at different times from road debris.\n\nUnexpected repairs: $60 \nMy horns randomly failed at 85k miles. I found a low mileage set from a 2022 model Y on ebay and swapped them myself. My drivers seat occupancy sensor is bad as well but is unnoticeable other than the alert within service mode.\n\nSuspension/alignments- $958\nFront upper control arms, 2x alignments, 2x rear traction arms, 2x front compliance arms. I replaced the arms myself and front control arms were replaced at a discounted rate at my service center. I am on MPP Sport coilovers so compliance arm and traction arm wear may have been accelerated a little. \n\nOverall I love my 3 and absolutely would purchase another. I regret not buying a performance but in mid 2021 M3P's were still selling for too much. My next vehicle is going to be a 21+ S LR or a highland ludicrous.",

      "text": "5 of these pics are not my actual cars though they were identical; the Celica, both Nissans, BMW and the Honda.\n\nThis is more or less in reverse order.\n\nThe Celica was my first car, had it for only a few weeks until some clown crashed into it.\n\nI drove both Nissan Bluebirds into the ground. The Bluebird Maxima has a VG20ET and was my first turbo. The Bluebird SSS was an ATTESA model, precursor to the AWD in the GTR - it only had a CA18DET engine and was pretty underwhelming all things considered.\n\nThe FTO was one of my favourite ever cars. It had a 6A13TT engine (2.5 twin turbo V6 from a Legnum VR4). This was a freaking weapon. I kept this in my garage for over a decade and ultimately sold it to my sisters boyfriend. I\u0019d let it deteriorate while out of the city for a very long time working.\n\nThe BMW looks identical to what I had, though mine was only a 320i, but had the Motorsport treatment from the factory. Was a nice car, I had it at the same time as the FTO as a daily. I got rid of it when I was working in another city.\n\nThe Fuga was only a 250GT, honestly piss weak, but nice to drive. \n\nThe Honda Sabre was a 2.5, don\u0019t remember much about it, I\u0019d left my job to study again and had to get a cheap car for transport.\n\nAfter graduating and getting back into a career, I bought the 2012 C7 A6 as we wanted something nice to travel in, got a good deal on it. It has the 3.0 supercharged V6 and DSG. Was a very good car, we used it as our wedding car. Good memories.\n\nNext up was my 2011 Jaguar XFR. 5.0 supercharged V8, but unfortunately it developed an engine problem and I rejected it, getting all my money back with the assistance of my lawyer. Only had it six months, entire time spent worrying that it would explode.\n\nI then bought the 2016 S3, which was a great wee car, but coming out of the XFR it felt slow and I\u0019d not sowed my V8 oats.\n\nTraded that in for probably my favourite ever car; my 2013 AMG E63 with the twin turbo 5.5 V8. This was a bloody weapon, but increasing fuel prices and maintenance meant that it was illogical to keep. I still greatly miss it.\n\nThat brings me to my 2019 Model 3 Performance. Still got it, though I\u0019m getting itchy feet again. Changing cars has become a bit of a meme for me.\n\nWhat\u0019s your journey?",

      "text": "Hello everyone\n\nI though I'll share my experience as a TM3LR owner of six months.\n\nI am from Denmark so prices will be in DKK, distances in KM, dates in DD/MM/YYYY format.  \n100 DKK = 13,52 USD  \n100 DKK = 13,45 EUR  \n(rates of 19/08/2022)\n\nStarting with the ordering &amp; delivery\n\nI ordered my MSM LR 18aero on the 14/12, nothing special happened.  \nAt that time ETD window was May 2022.  \nI had the money for the downpayment, so no issues.  \nIt hasn't moved until 04/02.   \nAt that time it became 17/02 - 03/03. I though cool, 3 months earlier.\n\n15/02 - ETD moved to 21/02 - 04/03  \n22/02 - ETD moved to 25/02 - 07/03 - I could schedule delivery so the next day I did, contracts, invoices signed, car registered to my name, licenseplate etc. done.  \n23/02 - ETD moved to 02/03 - 02/03  \n28/02 - Tesla called me that there is some issue with the car and they cannot deliver on 02/03, so i need to reschedule so ETD 04/03  \n03/03 - Tesla called again, that the delivery for tomorrow is not gonna happen, the car cannot connect to mobile network, service is on it, and if i want to I can pick it up tomorrow, but there will be no mobile connection and ranger service will fix it. I said ok, I can hotspot my phone, no biggie.  \nLater that day I got called again, that I cannot take the car, since the mobile connection is needed for the SOS service, so it is considered a safety issue if it doesn't work. ETD 10/30  \n9/03 - ETD moved to 18/3 during the evening so I couldn't call Tesla.  \n10/03 - ETD moved to 11/3 (I don't even remember why...)  \n11/03 - ETD moved to 18/3, I had another MSM LR assigned to my account with 19´´ sport wheels. I called Tesla (Aarhus), they said that the issue with my car for not connecting to LTE is that it has a dead gsm module and they need spare parts, however, they found another MSM LR in another city (Odense), they will switch the wheels to the 18´´, and bring it to my home address so I don't have to go to the service center.  \n12/03 - after discussing the above details, delivery was scheduled to 15/03.  \n15/03 - I got my car. MIC TM3LR MSM 18aero\n\nThis was about the delivery experience. Not the best, but it doesn't really matter in retrospect, I still got my car 3 months earlier than initially expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuality of the car\n\nAt delivery, the car was perfect.  \nNo panelgaps, no scratches, no squeaky anything.  \nToday, after driving a total of 21000kms so far, only a few minor issues came up: the trunk lift motor/damper is moving in a bit of a wobbly way and depending on temperature, it creaks.  \nThe other is the front left suspension which gives out a thumping sound every now and then when I go over a speedbump. Both are going to be checked in two weeks.\n\nApart from these, all is still perfect.\n\nNo fogging of the taillights, no misaligned doors, no squeaking control arm, no sagging of seats. Nothing.  \nPaint has scratches - some are my fault for scrubbing dried seagull droppings too enthusiastically, some are from normal wear.  \nI have some tiny stonechips on the windshield - inevitable... I had one slighlty more concerning chip, but got fixed the next day at carglass - free of charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCost\n\nThe car itself of course is not the cheapest, but I bought it before the price spikes recently, so it was 460000DKK (+20k for the loan interest). As comparison, today with the same conditions it would be 505k +22k interest.\n\nRunning cost is cheap. I have a subscription for unlimited charging for 670DKK a month so charge is almost no cost (using supercharger only on roadtrips outside the nordics), especially when I carpool a colleague of mine, then it is almost 0DKK in a month.\n\nInsurance is a bit more than what I had with my previous car (Skoda Fabia 1,6TDI sportline), but not crazy expensive.\n\nEnvironmental tax is the lowest 600DKK/Year (my skoda was 3600/year)\n\nThat is for the upkeep, and then of course I bought some accessories for a total of 4600DKKThese were: Display swivel, knick ring, spoiler, jackpads, center tray, screen protector, matte black front emblem and tesla letters for the trunk, wheelcap set, black pedals and a intake vent protector.\n\nI pay for the convenience of the premium connectivity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsumption\n\nI keep track of two consumptions - one I call net, which is purely the consupmtion of driving and the gross, which is the total electricity consumed broken down to kilometers driven.Since I have sentry always running, I am also cooling the car whenever it gets warm, gross is ofc. higher.\n\nNet: 151,3 Wh/kmGross: 228,2 Wh/km\n\nSo far, compared to my previous car, I saved on fuel 12000DKK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter these 21000kms drive, I still think this is the best car I've owned. Ride is a bit rough, but that's a price you pay for a heavy EV in this pricerange, and not worse than the Skoda I had.  \nThe seats are comfortable even on long rides.Sound system is amazing.  \nCargo space is plenty, only the opening of the trunk makes it difficult sometimes.  \nI drive a lot on highway and now I couldn't imagine my daily commute without autopilot.   \nI have only the standard, but i can count on one of my hands the occasions of phantom slowings (not breaking, it never slammed on it so far)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand for the end, some pictures of charts and the car itself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There she is, on a roadtrip to Copenhagen](https://preview.redd.it/tqcxtf7hini91.jpg?width=1119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7fd214cc8def439363d1535a3e5dc0b9704533)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla-inspired stats for the total charing](https://preview.redd.it/ln5x4ygjini91.jpg?width=1304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d3de267fb3a19b310d52a83eb9ff3166d608e9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla-inspired stats for the last 31days of charging](https://preview.redd.it/ii9vfl93jni91.jpg?width=1303&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab72e7e422dbcb8cbf24bb85c490ec0b576e8ef0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monthly cost breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0inwmgwjini91.jpg?width=1308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa91dc8eb3feb6b55c0036cbbf3aba69337ae384)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More detailed cost and consumption breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/71snihakini91.jpg?width=1309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3755b16634fc2363cc1bb28bcf7c7c7dfcebd1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some battery degradation estimate](https://preview.redd.it/x0zi4kczkni91.jpg?width=1689&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d1b62fe5984bd26210929dc1964a7bd2a78a78)",

My 7 year old uses a catchphrase \u001cwhat can\u0019t the Tesla do!?!\u001d Because in her opinion it can do anything and she believes the Roadster will be able to fly, which may actually be true (though I haven\u0019t broken it to her that we probably won\u0019t be getting one) \n\nI\u0019ve had over the last decade a BMW M3, a Mercedes E500, and Audi A7, an Audi SQ5 and my Model 3 is my favorite of them all at half the cost.  \n\nSo for anyone thinking about getting one that may be distracted by the chatter about paint swirls and gaps, just know that the over-arching experience is painless for many.",

      "text": "Picked up this car 10 days ago, first time Tesla owner. I had a free week so I figured I\u0019d take it on a trip to test it.\n\nI live in Norway and the plan was to just hit the road and see how long we could get.\n\nWe ended up putting over 4k km driving through South norway- Sweden- Denmark- Germany- Netherlands- Belgium in a 7-days itinerary. Here are some thoughts:\n\n-I was worried about the car\u0019s range since it is the standard range model. I\u0019m disappointed with it and really regret not picking up the model with the higher one. However Tesla\u0019s supercharger network is amazing and I always had several options within range, without having to do any changes in my route.\n\n-The climate control is amazing and hands down the best I\u0019ve used, we were never cold, it was super cozy and warm at all times, despite the cold weather outside.\n\n-Both the car and the driving experience are comfortable. The seats, the steering wheel, the feeling& Driving was easy and super smooth. \nWe actually had to sleep 3 nights in the car and I was impressed about how great it went and how much space we had with the seats down. And only losing about 6-8% each night with camp modus on. No stressing about where to charge the phones or even the laptop was amazing. This could have been an absolute pain with another car.\n\n-Performance wise I have no complains, gotta love the acceleration. Driving the car above 200 km/h on the Autobahn felt really safe, and almost boring, but in a good way. The battery goes down really fast at 203km/h (which is the max reachable speed no matter what).\n\n-It was super cheap, even only using superchargers I saved a lot of money by not using fuel. I paid around 2700kr and saved 4200kr according Tesla\u0019s app.\n\nI have a few questions: \n\n-The range, I was getting about 250-300 km max per charge. I get that the weather takes a huge toll on the battery, but was a little worried since I see many here getting much more. Is this normal or should I have it checked?\n\n-I didn\u0019t really think about this before, but now I\u0019m wondering if it can be damaging driving at top speed for extended periods? It didn\u0019t feel like I was pushing it too much and the car was acting smooth the whole time. \n\nOverall I am more than satisfied with the car and it won\u0019t be my last Tesla.",

      "text": "So after the first month of owning my Model 3 (SR) in southeastern Pennsylvania, I've already learned quite a few useful tidbits of information about the car itself and its various post-delivery needs. Since some of these things include issues without immediate answers, If figured I'd share my experience for others living in our Tesla-heavy area who haven't yet taken delivery or for those who find other people writing about familiar surroundings enjoyable.\n\n**Pre-Delivery**: So between my initial order and my delivery, I moved from the D.C.-area back to PA. Of course, this was a very stupid move planning-wise for me, as it made the entire delivery process much more complicated than it needed to be. ***DO NOT*** do this if your estimated delivery is in the same general timeframe as your move. I was told, rather explicitly, by my Sales Rep (SA) that I couldn't take delivery of a vehicle with a PA license in Virginia, despite being told the opposite by a salesperson at the Tesla store I purchased from. Thankfully, I had ordered in the store with said SA, and so changing delivery sites was relatively straightforward. Additionally, I needed to update information such as my new Drivers License and Insurance, which I chose to do instead at the Devon location shortly after getting those things. If you're doing this same boneheaded process, I'd recommend just going to a Tesla store to do it instead of talking over the phone.\n\nOther assorted pre-delivery tidbits:\n\n* Carvana gave me an absolute fortune for my previous vehicle. Granted, it was in excellent condition and had low mileage, but thanks to the used car market, I got about 50% more than Kelly Blue Book had quoted me on. Very smooth process selling the car, and I chose to do so before moving to avoid PA's [very dumb vehicle registration process for new residents](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/New-Resident-Relocation-Information/New%20Residents/Pages/Motor-Vehicle-Information-for-New-Residents.aspx) and the associated fees.\n\n* If you do a test drive, I'd highly suggest a route between the Devon and KoP stores. Its a good mix of highway traffic along a short stretch of 202, as well as the type of residential and multi-lane roads you're probably used to driving during your normal routine. Even if you've already ordered a car, I'd strongly recommend doing it if you haven't already to get a feel for how it handles so your first experiences with regen braking aren't in a crowded parking lot with lots of other cars.\n\n**Delivery Day**: While there was some slight panel misalignment and and a few other small cosmetic issues, the delivery was an extremely smooth process. Minus my detailed inspection of the car and personalizing the interface, the total time spent doing paperwork and waiting was approximately 15 minutes. One important thing to note about the Devon location is that it had virtually no parking available. I was thankfully able to get a spot, but I'm pretty sure it was the last one available. Also important to know is that there is only parking on the east side of the service center, the other side appears to be strictly for inventory and was packed to the brim with wrapped up cars awaiting future delivery.\n\n**Post-Delivery**: For PA, there are some interesting things in the immediate post-delivery timeframe that are good to know ahead of time. These include:\n\n* Tesla's PA Service Centers aren't certified for State Inspections. While you'll be provided with a permanent license plate and temp registration on-site, you will need to get the car state inspected within the first two weeks. Schedule this ahead of time. Even more frustrating is that the Model 3, like other Teslas, has special jacking requirements due to the battery underneath. Many traditional auto-repair centers can't/won't service the car because of this, and you should be very cautious about where you take it to ensure your car isn't poorly handled like [/u/bbtow69's poor car was](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/npudzg/is_this_lifted_incorrectly/). Check out this [old Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bxgage/state_inspection_near_devon_pa_service_center/) for some helpful recommendations. The good news (I guess) is that [PA doesn't require an emissions test of electric vehicles](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvspubsforms/BMV/BMV%20Safety%20Inspection%20Bulletins/Safety_Bulletin_BI14-1.pdf).\n\n* If you have the (dis)pleasure of living under PECO's incompetence, they offer you [a whole $50 rebate](https://pecorebateportal.com/electric-vehicles/smart-driver-rebate.html) for your trouble. I'd say go spend it on Phillies tickets, but you should definitely spend it on a [paint repair kit](https://shop.tesla.com/product/paint-repair-kit) instead to cover for [PennDot's mismanagement](https://i.redd.it/576otwicf1t21.jpg) of our roads. More on the *pain* repair kit later.\n\n* Another important note regarding PECO are its peak/off-peak hours. For 2021, the [Super Off-peak hours are Midnight to 6AM, and Peak hours are from 2PM-6PM on weekdays](https://www.inquirer.com/business/pennsylvania-peco-default-service-tou-rates-time-of-use-20201204.html). A standard rate applies during all other times. **EDIT** This rate does not yet apply, but a plan was proposed and approved in December 2020.\n\n* The Commonwealth itself offers a more substantial BEV incentive of [$750 for new or used vehicles under $50k](https://www.dep.pa.gov/citizens/grantsloansrebates/alternative-fuels-incentive-grant/pages/alternative-fuel-vehicles.aspx). This is a grant and is not tied to tax returns. However, it's first come, first serve, so get it while you can!\n\n* I had some slight panel misalignment and the plastic trim attached to my passenger-side mirror coming off, noted to the sales rep on delivery day. I didn't realize it, but you also need to separately file a service ticket through the app for this. They ultimately sent out a mobile service tech to fix both, and it was covered under warranty. It took a few weeks to get them out there, so I'd recommend filing the  service ticket on delivery day as soon as you get home.\n\n**The Driving Experience**: So this is (obviously) the best part of owning the car. Here's what I've learned while driving around the area:\n\n* Driving the car with full regen braking is incredibly fun along the winding curves of our area. It feels like a sports car, both in the comfort of the ride and the handling. One pedal driving is especially useful for close curves and hills, and it feels like you have far more control over the vehicle. Because our roads are [a bit special](https://i.redd.it/ypl9rt8y7h571.jpg), you'll likely notice the ride is a bit more bumpy due to the steel spring suspension of the Model 3. While this may be a deal-breaker for those used to a super smooth ride in a luxury vehicle, I've found it to be fine and gives the ride a bit more \"texture\" without the vibration of an ICE engine in front of you. It's simply more noticeable due to the bumpiness of the roads around here, and the potholes can be a bit unnerving. Overall, the car handled these like a champ, and I feel much more in control of my car when driving than I ever did its AWD predecessor. I've heard that potholes can be pretty dangerous for the 19\" and 20\" wheels, so definitely try to avoid those if possible.\n\n* I'd also recommend setting the car to creep or roll for the first hundred miles or so if you aren't used to driving with strong regen braking, as the transition is a bit difficult. Also good to know is that regen braking applies the tail lights at a certain braking threshold, so don't be paranoid like I was and assume you need to apply the brakes as well to avoid getting rear-ended. After you're used to the creep or roll, the transition to \"hold\" will be very smooth and is highly recommended to extend your range.\n\n* Autopilot will work on virtually any road with a median lane marker. Despite actively following Tesla development for nearly a decade, I was under the impression that AP functionality was geofenced to major interstates. Not true. It works on many roads, including rural \"highways\" such as Route 1, but keep in mind that it **will not** stop for stop lights and stop signs like FSD is supposed to. For Route 1 in particular, I wasn't quite ready to let the car handle the high-speed, blind curves around the MD border, so I switched over to manual and had some fun doing the legal speed limit of *55MPH* and still feeling like I'm going too fast. Speaking of country roads, my first major autopilot \"freak out\" occurred when passing an Amish Buggy. While driving on AP, the car saw the Buggy on the right and an oncoming car on the left, and as I drew closer, promptly threw a temper tantrum and kicked me out of AP. Thankfully, I was assuming that the Buggy might cause issues and was already in the process of switching over to manual control. On a later drive through this route without a buggy or oncoming traffic, I discovered that this particular area of road is a hotspot for Phantom Braking, so ultimately it was double-whammy of events. Overall, proceed with the regular amount of caution as you normally would for a buggy.\n\n* I had the joy to discover in late-May that [Tesla had made some important changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31HaTbWONmQ) to my vehicles components after ordering, and would be taking delivery of Tesla-vision vehicle without lumbar support. Outside of my test drive Model 3, I've not had any experiences with a radar-equipped M3, but what I can say is that I've felt quite confident in its ability function in clear conditions. I was also pretty happy to see that the car was receiving updates last week, and appreciated some of the other QOL changes such as the ability to toggle off the auto-brights during autosteer. I'd still prefer being able to outright disable the auto-brights given how bad they are at detection on highways, but for now I think I can deal with the current setup. The lumbar support omission hasn't been much of an issue to my passengers, however I'm still pretty annoyed about the situation.\n\n**Accessories and Other Tidbits**:\n\n* Since we live in a region with, ahem, *Four Seasons*, you'll definitely want to purchase [Splash Guards/Mud Flaps](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-mud-flaps) for your car to [protect the notably poor quality paint](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/55412/tesla-model-3-s-paint-problem-has-a-solution-now/) from salt and gravel spray. It's also recommended to purchase the PPF, but I forgot to add it to my cart that day and can't give a review for it. What I can give a review for are the splash guards and optional mud flaps. The flaps themselves are detachable and hang only about an inch and a half from the ground. I strongly recommend that you don't attach these, as they scrapped along the ground during turns. I have absolutely no idea how Tesla thought these were acceptable to sell to consumers at their current length, but I guess that's what I get for buying a car designed in always sunny, always summer California. The installation process was pretty easy, the only tools needed are a ratchet wrench fitted with a 10MM Hex attachment and a screwdriver to remove the pins on the wheel wells. It took about 20 minutes total to install both, and I'd recommend installing them as soon as you can after deliver to protect from any debris you kick up while driving.\n\n* If you're getting the SR+, the car somehow doesn't come with floor mats despite being a $40K vehicle. Given how many aftermarket floor mats are available, there are a lot of options to choose from. I can't really give a review for the ones I purchased, as I've only had them a month, but I can say you have a wide variety of options to choose from. You'll definitely want to buy something though to protect the car's interior carpet from mud, dirt and basically anything else.\n\n* I purchased a screen protector for my display from [Spigen](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-Designed/dp/B084BNC3FG/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2L662REOLO0LC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=spigen+tesla+model+3+screen+protector&amp;qid=1623845582&amp;sprefix=spigen+tesla%2Caps%2C147&amp;sr=8-2), and it's working pretty well so far. Installation was easy, and the matte anti-glare is largely unnoticeable but protects from smudging.\n\n* Having gotten many dings and scrapes on my previous car in public garages, I decided to purchase a paint repair kit in case it was needed. Frustratingly, in the very first week of ownership, I needed it. I'm not sure how it happened, but at some point my tire  kicked up a piece of debris with enough force that the edge of my rocker around the wheel well was bent-in to the extent that the paint split along a small section around the edge of the rocker where the side meets the wheel well. No matter the cause, the paint repair kit rather was relatively easy to use after watching a number of guides, with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FC0xCixhU0) being the best I could find. A good reason to install the guards as soon as you can, as it presumably would have prevented this damage.\n\n\n* I originally purchased [Silver RIMETRIX Orbitals](https://rimetrix.com/product/orbital-silver/) for my car because I wanted something a bit more flashy than the aero wheels. The plan was to buy them, then coat them with Duplicolor [Hyper Silver](https://www.duplicolor.com/product/hyper-silver-coating/) to give them a metallic finish that would reduce their plastics look. After owning the car for a few weeks, I actually found the Aeros to look just fine and cancelled my order. I may come back to the orbitals, but for now I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite dreaming of owning a Tesla for nearly a decade and following them very closely since the early Model S days, I started to get cold feet as delivery day approached and the Tesla vision announcement was made. I wound up taking delivery anyway, and I'm incredible happy that I did. The car handles exceptionally, is very intuitive to use, and most importantly, I just love looking at it and knowing its all mine. If you're in the same spot that I was, I hope this review gives you a bit more insight into a number of steps in this process, as well as some of the quirks and benefits of owning a Tesla in our area.

I've been commenting here that the fuel savings that Tesla promotes are *very* conservative. That the savings and the tax credit... those things count. YMMV.\n\nEngineering Explained has a recent post that does the forward-looking maths. [https://youtu.be/7bIBs8GuUYY](https://youtu.be/7bIBs8GuUYY)\n\nHow it relates to recent news? I've seen \"damages,\" \"made whole,\" and \"gap insurance\" used here in recent days in relation to the price cut. Please stop typing these words. If you took delivery in the last few weeks or so, you have a legitimate issue; looks like Tesla is going address it.\n\nBut, if you took delivery in Jan 2019, Dec 2018, or Nov 2018, or *anytime* in 2018, Tesla owes you the car you agreed to pay for at the price you agreed was fair. Would I have preferred to pay less? Yes! Have we gotten the tax credit? The $350 in fuel savings? And best of all, the benefit the car? Also yes! Fast, quiet, clean, and with more features today than on the day we took delivery. Thus far, it's not just the best *car* we've ever purchased, but the best *product.*\n\n(What about my electric bill? Unchanged. Budget billing plan. My actual Feb bill went from $247 in 2018 to $148 in 2019 for comparison. But we added insulation in Jan... previous home owner left the attic un-insulated. July bill was $342 (that was pre M3), because we have an old crappy A/C unit and the planet is heating. The net is that it's difficult to make apples/apples comparisons given the info we have and the variables involved.)",

      "title": "2 Years and 110k km review in a cold, Canadian prairies climate",
      "text": "We bought an EV 2 years ago and it seems like everywhere we go, people are really interested in it. I did a 1 year, 53k km review that can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/zruis8/1_year_and_53k_km_with_an_ev_in_saskatchewan/) It goes into the background about why we decided to go the route we did, which EV's we considered, etc. Basically we drive a lot and were spending a ridiculous amount on fuel so wanted to reduce our costs. We have done that.\n\nWe decided to purchase a Tesla Model 3 because it was the cheapest AWD EV we could get and the Tesla fast charging (Level 3) infrastructure is vastly superior to anything else.\n\nWhen charging at home, we use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle. We just bought a couple adaptors for it. We installed a NEMA 14-50 plug in the garage. We did this ourselves for material cost, which was about $75. At the max 32 amps, it charges at 10% an hour. We park in a heated (5C) garage year round, but that is not a requirement.\n\nFor the life of the vehicle, we are averaging 208 Wh/km. Typical home power costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering the climate here. We have added solar to our home, so we try to charge as much as possible when the sun is shining, reducing our cost even more when we can.\n\nMore affordable EV's are constantly being released, but they are still very hard to get in Saskatchewan. The fast charging infrastructure has vastly improved since we got the vehicle. Tesla is officially opening up their fast charging network to Ford and GM in February 2024, which will be a massive step forward for those companies. Most other manufacturers are adopting the Tesla (NACS) charge port in the coming years which will definitely help the viability of those EV's here in SK.\n\nUnfortunately, Tesla has greatly increased the fast charging costs. Throughout SK it is now $0.60/kWh, or 4x as expensive as home charging. There are some other fast chargers that can be cheaper than the Tesla network. Even so, with gas prices declining, if exclusively fast charging on a trip, an EV is not near as cheap to run as they used to be. It is a similar usage cost to a Honda Civic if you are exclusively fast charging.\n\nFast chargers are constantly being built, but we absolutely need a lot more. More Level 2 chargers, which are relatively cheap to install, are needed at destinations like golf courses, rec centers, museums, all the types of places that out of towners frequent. Saskatchewan does have a substantial advantage in that Level 1 chargers already exist at most work places, hotels, etc. Being prepared for a lot of block heaters has its advantages.\n\nObviously the major concern people have with EV's is winter driving. I do not have any concerns any more. If I was constantly doing long distance, remote trips, especially if towing, obviously an EV is not ideal. However, for the normal commuter or long distance driver, there really should not be a worry. I think If your commute is 250km or less, an EV really is ideal. I actually prefer driving our EV in the winter now. It instantly blows warm air, you don't have to wait for an engine to warm up before creating heat. Below about -35C when travelling at highway speeds, it isn't hot. But it easily keeps the interior at 20C and works just as well as a regular vehicle.\n\nThe ability to control the vehicle through an app, for free, is awesome. We set our departure time and the cabin and battery are warm and ready at that time. You can also set your charging times, charging % limit, view charging stats and really do almost anything through the app. It really does work great.\n\nOur first year with the vehicle we have zero issues. The past year, we have had some. All work was done at the service center in Saskatoon. They have been awesome to deal with. The heat pump failed and was replaced under warranty. The front suspension also was creaking and was fully replaced under warranty. Neither of these was a surprise as they were common issues at the time. We also had a charge port replaced as the locking mechanism was sticking. The rear motor oil pump was also replaced. These were all replaced under warranty for free. All items were replaced with updated items that hopefully have fixed the problems. So far we haven't had any further issues.\n\nMaintenance has been minimal. I change the cabin air filters 2 or 3 times a year because we live on gravel. I get the brakes serviced annually. That is all that we have for maintenance.\n\nTo summarize, we are very happy with our EV. While it hasn't been perfect and it takes more planning on trips, it really works great for us. It is crazy cheap to drive, especially when charging at home. That is huge for us because we obviously drive a lot. I think we will always have at least 1 EV as our main commuter vehicle. We have been really happy with it",

      "text": " Our Model 3 a year ago and its hard to find reviews for these cars in areas that get cold. Really cold. -40 cold. So I figured I would write a review. And discuss our costs vs the ICE vehicle we previously owned.\n\nWe picked up a new, 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range on December 31 and have just passed 53000km. So far it has been outstanding, performing incredibly well. We\u0019ve added PPF to the entire front, tinted windows in the rear, Rally Armor flaps, Mountain Pass Performance skid plate and winter wheels with Michelin X-Ice Snow winter tires. We keep the hub caps on the standard wheels in the summer to increase efficiency.\n\nWe live about 35km out of town, going to town at least twice a day during the week for daycare. We also do a 900km round trip quite often. We had 2 front facing car seats when we bought it, but now one kid is in a booster.\n\nOur previous vehicle was a 2010 Lexus RX350 that was paid off. Fuel costs were getting too high so we decided to take the plunge to an electric. We used money we got from the sale of the vehicle as a down payment on the new one. I\u0019m 6ft tall with relatively long legs. I am more comfortable in the Model 3 than I was in the RX350.\n\nOriginally was expecting to buy a Chevrolet Bolt EUV, but with the recalls we couldn\u0019t buy one. We then decided that AWD was a requirement considering where we live and my wife strongly prefers it. Alternatives we considered were the VW ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mach-E. The wait for the Hyundai and VW were likely minimum 2 years and the local Ford dealer is not the best combined with prices that we thought were too high. Ground clearance wasn\u0019t a huge factor as we have a truck that I drive if it snows too much. And the Tesla Supercharging network is infinitely better than anything else in the prairies right now.\n\nThe car is parked in a heated (5C) garage year round. I installed a NEMA 14-50 outlet and charge at a max of 18 amps. We could charge at up to 32 amps, but it doesn't need to be that fast. We just use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle and a 14-50 adaptor. It\u0019s always plugged in and the battery is set to a maximum charge of 80%. In the winter, we schedule our departure time using the app. \n\nOur lifetime average is 207 Wh/km. Power at home costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3 with home charging. This pretty good considering, especially considering the climate here.\n\nNow the main reason why we bought the car, to save money. We obviously drive a lot, way more than normal which made the math simple to justify. Our total public charging costs for the year are $1137. Our home power usage increased by about 9700 kWh, or $1455. We also used some free chargers. That gives us a total power cost of $2592. In our previous vehicle we averaged 13L/100km of premium fuel. At a conservative estimate of $1.75/L fuel price for the year, that works out to a total fuel cost of $12,057. (13L\\*$1.75 = $22.75/100km. 53000/100 = 530. 530\\*22.75 = $12,057). Our previous vehicle would have very conservatively required $1000 in maintenance to give us an annual cost of $13,057. Our total maintenance cost for our EV for the year was $150 for a brake service and cabin air filters. In our 1 year with an EV, we have saved at least $10,315 in driving cost. (($12,057 + $1000) - ($2592+$150) = $10,315). Including the price of our car payment, we have still saved over $2700 this year. And it actually is even more than that, if you were to properly factor in paying for gas (100% depreciation) vs paying for the car (much less than 100% depreciation).\n\nThe one concern everyone seems to have is the heat. It been great except when below -35C (-31F) on the highway. Sometimes at that temperature it\u0019s great, but other times it\u0019s just ok. It is always plenty good enough, even at those temperatures. In my experience, it is just as good below -35C as other vehicles I have had (Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra, Lexus RX350, Dodge Ram, to name a few) and better than others, like our previous Honda Civic. The BEST part about the heat, is that it is instant. You don't have to wait for the engine to warm up before it starts throwing heat. You turn it on with the app and in 5 minutes at -35C, the interior is toasty warm. Its incredible.\n\nIn summary, we have saved over $2700 this year by purchasing a new EV. We are extremely happy about the purchase! Because we drive so much, its absolutely made sense to purchase it. I still love driving it and highly recommend it to everyone. When we get solar in the spring, our operating costs will be even less. Excited for that!",

We were billed for 329 kWh of electricity between those hours this past month, which was partial summer rates and non-summer rates.  At full summer rates that came out to $37 for the month including the $5 EV discount.  If those 329 kWh were for gas for our old Chrysler 300 that would have cost us nearly $240.  So, the fuel savings can be dramatic.  Of course, those 329 kWh weren\u0019t all for charging our car, since our nighttime A/C was also kicking in from time to time, in addition to all the other electrics running around the house, but our EV nighttime credit assumed it all was.",

      "text": "I drove 1400 miles (2250 km) over 3 days to see a bunch of family. I thought I'd summarize my experience with the car (it's about a month old) over the trip. I got the LR version.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the way there, it took about the same amount of time as if I had driven my old ICE car, as the two stops were the same we would have taken anyway, and the time was similar. Around family, there wasn't much charging that we needed to do, but it did add to some trips that otherwise wouldn't have had the extra time. The trip home added an extra hour to the trip that we wouldn't have used. The return trip was done over night, so everyone besides me was sleeping and the 30 min charging stops were more intrusive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, the efficiency wasn't bad, at 248 wh/mi for the entire trip. There were sections that were much better, with some sections around 190 wh/mi (Washington, DC traffic for example). There were other sections closer to home where the speeds are much higher and the efficiency is much worse (300 wh/mi in VA/NC where I was driving 77 mph (125 kph) ). 'Fuel' cost about $80 at superchargers in total, though I started at 90% and did some charging with family over one night, where it's cheaper (12 c/kwh at home) or free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAutopilot drove 99% of the time since it was highways or country roads with double yellows pretty much everywhere. Autopilot has a few quirks like with on-ramps... when the dashed white line ends to force the merge, autopilot sees a giant lane and tries to get into the middle of it so it moves over then has to move back. Also, with cars stopped on the shoulder, it can break for no reason as well. For what I expected it to do (keep me in my line and not hit people in front of me) it did its job well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, the trip was good. The seats are comfortable, and the car has a lot of cargo space. It could do with a bit more leg room for the driver, but otherwise no complaints about the car's interior design. Navigation was good, though it could use an option to force it to calculate a different supercharging location if you want to veto the choice it gives you. There was one we stopped at on the way to family that was good during the day, but would have been useless at night since it was in a strip mall. I ended up choosing a destination myself to skip that one since it wouldn't change which one otherwise. The location of superchargers can be a bit hit or miss. The best ones we stopped at were either at a rest stop or at a larger gas station/convenience store. The crappy ones were at strip malls... great for shopping, but not great for road trips.",

      "title": "The cost of charging a Tesla",
      "text": "As we all know, charging an electric vehicle is much cheaper than filling a gas vehicle. Especially Gas prices are creeping up again. Oil prices are up 30% since early July. But how much does it cost to charge an EV (I am only analyzing Tesla here)? In fact, it all depends on where you charge. If you choose the right place, you can actually save a lot of money over the course of a year.\n\n**Charging A Tesla At Home**\n\nUnless you have the benefit of free charging \u0014 some early Tesla owners are still eligible for complimentary Supercharger access \u0014 connecting your Tesla to your home charging station is likely the most cost-effective method. In North Dakota, you can charge a Tesla Model 3 RWD from completely empty to a full battery for just $7 at home, although this scenario represents the most economical case. North Dakota boasts the lowest average electricity cost in the country, at less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, and the base Model 3 has a smaller battery than all other Tesla models. In contrast, charging the larger battery of a Model S or Model X with the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. (at $0.34 per kilowatt-hour in Connecticut) would set you back nearly $40.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that comparing the cost of charging an EV with filling up a gasoline tank isn't a straightforward apples-to-apples comparison. To get a meaningful perspective, we must consider how far your budget can take you with each type of vehicle. As demonstrated in the table below, you can operate a Tesla for as little as a few cents per mile. For example, an individual covering the national average of 13,500 miles annually while consistently using their home charging station could incur expenses ranging from $405 to $1,755 for charging.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlp3d1lxwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8223570436f03f1411a2227bc912ee894c300739\n\nThe precise figures you encounter will naturally fluctuate, influenced by factors such as your local electricity rates and your vehicle's actual efficiency in real-world conditions, which can be impacted by variables like weather conditions and your driving habits.\n\nT**he Pricing for Utilizing a Tesla Supercharger**\n\nTesla's extensive network, boasting an impressive 17,000 Superchargers, offers the advantage of convenience, albeit with a price tag. A Supercharger can swiftly charge a Tesla from nearly empty to 80 percent capacity within a mere 15 to 30-minute timeframe. However, it's worth noting that the electricity cost at Superchargers is approximately twice as much as what you'd spend charging your vehicle at home. The pricing spectrum varies, spanning from $0.25 to $0.50 per kilowatt-hour, contingent upon your location.\n\nIf you want to check the price of each charging station, Lectric provides this service for free (an EV all-in-one app), it can help you find the most affordable stations near you. The difference between Lectric and the Tesla platform is that in addition to Supercharger, Lectric also supports price inquiries of other suppliers like EA, Evgo, etc. It also supports price comparison during route planning. You can choose the cheapest or shortest route according to your needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krabdumqwssb1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301d999bfa5a4a543803c6e92e429ce126ec8809\n\nWhile most EV drivers typically utilize these DC fast chargers for long-distance journeys, some Tesla owners rely on Superchargers as their primary charging stations, akin to conventional gas stations. The table provided below presents energy expenses based on prevailing Supercharger rates, with annual energy cost projections calculated under the assumption of covering 13,500 miles annually, relying exclusively on Supercharger charging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk4qdp4vwssb1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c9fe328c1379e3f9b04bb273190deb14cc7ec0\n\nTesla occasionally entices new buyers with complimentary Supercharging, typically offered toward the end of the year or fiscal quarter to stimulate sales. In recent years, these incentives have been restricted to 1,000 miles or a one-year duration. However, there's a noteworthy exception for some Model S and Model X vehicles sold before January 15, 2017, which included a unique perk of free lifetime Supercharging. This benefit seamlessly transfers to each new owner whenever the vehicle changes hands. Consequently, these specific Teslas can be somewhat elusive in the market and often command a premium when they become available for sale. Their added value is typically most pronounced for individuals intending to rely solely on Superchargers, considering the economical nature of home charging.\n\nShould you express interest in a comprehensive comparison between the expenses of Charging a Tesla and Fueling a Gasoline Vehicle, I will provide a detailed update in forthcoming content.",

      "text": "Picked up my [\u001921 M3P](https://imgur.com/FbxWOwz) almost a month ago and took my first road trip from [LA to Sedona](https://imgur.com/qPSaO9P) last week. First time with an EV on a drive like this and happy to report it was a **fantastic** experience.\n\nFirst, the trip was planned through [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com). Can\u0019t recommend that enough for a drive like this. I set up the drive and used the web browser to share the trip with the Tesla nav (could have done the same with the app but I liked pulling the trip back up in the browser as well). I paid for a month of premium since that includes real time supercharger availability - I knew how many chargers were in use before I got there and had no issues at all charging. Speaking of, having to stop to charge 2-3 times each way was a nice change to the typical ICE road trip. It broke the 7 1/2 hour drive up in to 2 - 2 1/2 hour chunks of driving. It was nice to get out and stretch and the chargers were at places where you could eat or explore. ABRP also plans your stops so you\u0019re not charging 50 minutes each time. It was more like 10-20 minutes and one 50 minute stop which is when we\u0019d eat lunch. I never had to experience range anxiety thanks to ABRP. I also made sure to stay at a hotel that had EV charging.\n\nThe longest stretch of driving was from Ehrenberg, AZ to LA. I set ABRP to arrive at my destinations with at least 30% charge, but going home I didn\u0019t need to make that 3rd stop to charge in between AZ and LA. The last leg ended up being 220 miles for 3 hours non-stop. I went from 100% &gt; 14% by the time I got home. The best part, according to TeslaFi, I saved $131 in fuel for the whole trip, and would have paid $42 in supercharging.  However I used my referral miles so it ended up being free!\n\nAs for the driving itself, autopilot was great on those long stretches. But I learned it\u0019s limitations. Can\u0019t use it over 80mph, and on smaller stretches where the speed limit was 55 or 65, it won\u0019t let you engage if you\u0019re traveling more than 5mph over the limit. Not a huge deal as autopilot definitely helped give me a break. As for the ride on the 20\u001d Uberturbines? It was fine. No complaints and no issues. \n\nThe only downside I can speak to was the massacre of biblical proportions on the front of my car. I anticipated this so I packed a bottle of ONR and some microfiber towels to get the bugs off. Didn\u0019t want to be driving around at my destination with the car looking like that. I even ended up going through a manual car wash where you get out and power wash it yourself.\n\nSo, overall, a great way to be introduced to road trips in a Tesla. Can't wait for the next one!",

      "title": "Three months with 2022 Model 3 RWD",
      "text": "**TLDR**\n\nAfter 3 months of owning the 2022 Model 3 RWD, I really enjoy the EV despite frustrating build quality, business practices, and technical support by Tesla. At the same time, those shortcomings will no doubt drive me to at least consider alternatives to Tesla when I am looking for a new car again in a decade. Now let the irrational fanboys descend with accusations of me being some ICE shill!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Use Case**\n\nHow we utilize our vehicles can significantly affect our overall satisfaction with said cars. In my case, I use this car as my daily driver and travel fairly short distances 95% of the time. My typical day involves a round trip of almost 13 miles and drains just about 10% of the battery and span 1 tollway plus 2 long streets. This puts my efficiency squarely as reported. My workplace offers complimentary charging  so I almost never charge at home, making my \"fuel\" costs essentially 0. Needless to say, I have been very happy with the M3 as my mode of transportation.\n\n**Driving Experience**\n\nMy driving experience has overall been a good one thus far. Choosing the M3 RWD was actually a deliberate decision as I could definitely afford a Model S. Thing is, I knew I didn't need the adrenaline pumping acceleration of the LR and beyond for even the M3 and that it would only get me in trouble with tickets. The RWD accelerates rapidly but smoothly and despite being the slowest of the Tesla family, already offers me far more speed than any car I have personally owned which lets me overtake cars when passing with much greater ease and safety. My previous Lexus ES350 might as well be a snail in comparison in terms of performance. Simply put, the RWD's performance makes it a joy to drive.\n\nWith that said however, the ride quality is pretty horrendous. I don't know if it's the quality of the suspensions or its tuning (maybe a combination of both), but the ride quality of the RWD is jarring. This is especially so coming from the ES350's super smooth ride. You keenly feel every bump. Some might argue that sporty cars naturally have stiff suspensions, but there is a difference between feeling stiff (say a Infiniti Q50) and feeling brittle. The Tesla's ride quality is clearly in the latter camp for me. In fact, I would say that the ride quality is so disappointing, that I am considering installing an aftermarket suspension.\n\n**Cabin Noise**\n\nThis bleeds into build quality and design, but the RWD (at least the one I have) is by far the loudest car I have personally owned. There is ever present wind sound from the driver window, some unknown rattling from the passenger side and overall, copious amounts of tire and road noise. Even when the music is banging, I can still hear the above mentioned noises. My ES350 was basically silent in comparison. When I took it in less than a week after delivery pickup and drove with the technician, they successfully identified the noise and then informed me that they would do nothing about it. In their words, it is a characteristic of their frameless design. Sorry, but I call BS on that. I've been in cars with frameless designs and none were comparable.\n\n**Build Quality**\n\nI get that Tesla went for a minimalistic design. However, there is a difference between minimalistic and cheap, which is territory that Tesla crosses into quite often. If the driving experience of other cars is very underwhelming compared to the RWD, then the RWD's build quality is very underwhelming in comparison to other cars. It is not put together as carefully; uneven panel gaps, slightly uncurled edges, thin carpet, and a both uneven and chip prone paint job. Even worse, unlike every other auto manufacturer on the planet, Tesla does not offer a la carte upgrade options for things like better audio or footwell lighting. It's pretty crazy!\n\n**Accessories &amp; Modifications**\n\nWith the build quality and factory upgrade options being as disappointing as they were, the plethora of aftermarket accessories and modifications available for Teslas really helps things out. To date, I have added the following accessories and modifications to my RWD.\n\n* Hansshow Dashboard Hidden HUD\n* XPEL XR+ tinting to all areas glass\n* XPEL Ultimate Plus PPF on the front\n* Katzkin pearl colored genuine leather seat covers\n* Katzkin gel-infused ventilated seat cushions\n* Katzkin Degreez cooling system for the driver seat\n* Taptes all-weather liners\n* Speck anti-glare screen protector\n* Front center console USB hub\n* Side door trash can\n* Backseat trash bag\n* Front cupholder inserts\n* Harnessed trunk organizer\n* Portable tire air pump\n\nWhile not all essential, these aftermarket upgrades have really upped the RWD's quality of life for me. It's a shame that none of that extra money went to Tesla though.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nWith everything said and done, I do really like the RWD. This is in spite of Tesla's cheap (and borderline deceitful) business decisions and the sheer unhelpfulness of the service center. With that being said, in a decade from how when other EV manufacturers close the performance and charging network gap, those aforementioned shortcomings will heavily impact my consideration of alternative EVs.",

      "title": "Tesla P3D+ owner since October 2019. I've got a few observations and want to know if others sense the same?",
      "text": "Hello Everyone, I will attempt to keep this brief (who am I kidding? :) ) BUT to the point.\n\n  \nPicked up a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance with FSD/Autopilot, October 7th 2019. It was amazingly fast, coming from a 2011 BMW M3 Manual, the P3D is an amazing performer. I still love my M3 and will probably now modify it even more to compete with the P3D.. but I digress.. I have observed (some not verifiable yet; but working on getting the tools to perform the tests) the following issues with the vehicle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) During Supercharging do you hear random \"Clunks\" or \"Thumps\" randomly? In the span of 45 minutes, I will hear 5 to 6 random thumps that emanate from the body. I also noticed getting the same thumps, when driving down a mountain road, and can sustain a recharge while going downhill for a few minutes. \n\nI akin the sound to the individual battery cells bursting.. :)\n\n2) The car performed flawlessly with Software version 2019.36.x.. the power increase was observable. Then I updated to 2019.40.x., and the car seems to have lost its raw power.. Acceleration isn't as exhilarating as it was before. Initially I thought that I got used to the car ( I will be verifying the 0-60 times with hardware timers once they arrive caused by the Christmas shipping lag.) \n\nMy suspicions of nerfed acceleration got additional \"fuel\" after driving 80 miles at 72 degree weather to my destination. The car wasn't feeling as strong, battery was at 90 miles remaining. \n\nI happened to come to a stop light and decided to see if I'm just hallucinating. Road conditions were clean, dry, straight, no dips, and no loose gravel or anything that could potentially trigger traction control. Tires have 3000 miles on them. \n\nLight turns green, I slam on the accelerator pedal, I get a quick lurch forward (0-6 mph), then power loss for 1 second ( I literally thought the car died), then it accelerates, but not as it should. I haven't been able to reproduce that issue again; I've tried accelerating on wet roads to see whether I can reproduce that power loss; nothing yet. \n\nSince then I have been even more skeptical if the car is performing as it should be (will be making an appointment with the Manufacturer to go over my concerns)\n\nNOTE: Yesterday I received the 2019.40.50 update (FSD Visualization) \n\n3) I do quite a bit of driving with the car; on the weekends, I will typically drive from San Diego to LA (about 110 miles) and consume approximately 130 to 140 battery miles. I figure with the lights, radio, A/C, heater that there will be parasitic losses. I also drive a \"bit\" over the speed limit so I am quite aware that I won't be getting the ranges advertised by the EPA and Tesla. However, today coming back from LA to San Diego caused me great concern. \n\nI was up at Angeles Crest in the morning, weather was in the 30s. When we were about to leave, the car reported that my tire pressures have dropped down to 36 to 37 psi on all four. Those numbers aren't low based on previous experiences, so I drove down the mountain with no  issues. A total of 40 battery miles was used for a 33 mile trip. The car rested a few hours in 60 degree weather. I head to a supercharger and charge the vehicle to 224 miles. It was late and I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for the remaining miles.\n\nUpon leaving the supercharger, weather conditions were 50 degrees and raining. I drive the 110 miles back to home, mostly \"downhill\" from LA to San Diego county. Tires at 37 to 38 psi, and the **car battery went from 224 miles to 22** miles when I finally reached my destination. I drove a conservative speed of 70  mph on average the entire trip.  \n\n200 battery miles to go 110 miles, 37 psi tires, 50 degree weather, raining, average speed of 70 mph.. \n\nDid the tire pressure make that much of a difference? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're able to relate to any of these issues with the Model 3, please let me know. In the meantime I plan to make an appointment and address these issues with the Tesla technician. I just wanted to know if my observations have any validity. \n\nIf I have posted against the rules, my sincere apologies, and I will remove.\n\nHappy Holidays to Everyone, may you have a safe and happy holiday!",

      "title": "My Tesla Model 3 Buying Experience",
      "text": "This one may be a little long so TL;DR: Almost everything was perfect with my experience. Tesla communicated well, my car only had one minor issue that mobile service is coming to my work to fix this week. I LOVE THE 3D!!!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Buying the car**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've wanted a 3 for a few years now. It is by far the most expensive car I've even thought about buying. My last car was a 2014 used Ford Focus (which I traded for this car). The used prices on 3s were not very good imo. There was a LR RWD with EAP close to me in early February for a decent price that I was tempted to buy...but I really wanted AWD because I live on hilly snowy dirt roads (yes I know snow tires). So when that list of RWDs still in inventory leaked, I decided to message Tesla to see what inventory cars they had in stock. I got in contact with a Tesla employee on reddit, and it all began...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessaged Guy #1 on reddit around 10pm 2/19/2019. He responded to my email within minutes with 2 RWD vehicles and 1 AWD. He went back and forth with me until almost 11pm (yes we\u0019re in the same timezone). I picked the AWD test drive inventory car with almost exactly 3k miles and a $2,820 discount. Initially I removed EAP, and switched the 19s out for 18s (I was told they could take off 19\" tires and give you 18\" and you'd obviously get the $1,500 off). I asked for pictures the next day before I put down my deposit and received the pictures within minutes (which was doubly amazing because my contact was in Florida, and the car was in Chicago). I did some back and forth with him about financing and a down payment, every response of his came almost instantly. It was great. I ran to SoS to get my title for my car, and once I had my title I put down my $2,500 deposit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*And then nothing.* He didn\u0019t respond immediately and I was scared all the rumors were coming true and I was going to have a bad experience from here on out. 39 minutes later he responded saying he was on a test drive. All good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that day, Girl #1 calls to talk about my order. She didn\u0019t know about the 18\u001d switch which worried me. She said she would call me back. I asked her to email me so I could easily contact her. She never emailed me&\n\nShe called me back and tried to switch me to a different car that already has 18s, saying it has less miles, and will be cheaper overall. She was wrong. She was not taking into account the -$1,500 for removing the 19s. I got worried again at this point, but decided to remain calm. I emailed Guy #1, and he got it sorted out. On my account, it still said I was paying $1,500 for the wheels, but there was also an additional -$1,500 discount applied. The car was now mine for sure. \n\nAt this point, my trade in quote came back. They offered $2,100 for my 2014 Ford Focus which has a KBB of $3,300. I had planned my financing around Tesla offering me $3,000 even. I emailed Guy #1 about this issue, and again, in minutes, he responded saying the team saw the wrong model year, and when I reloaded the website, the quote was $3,000. \n\nIn all this emailing with Guy #1, Girl #1 had not called or emailed me again. 2/21/2019 around 1PM Girl #1 emailed me apologizing for not responding. Looking back, it really was not a long time to wait for an email. I was just anxious and hoping everything would go smoothly. I had said I would be ok waiting for the 18\u001d wheels to come in, but she informed me the 18\u001d wheels were on backorder for 6-8 weeks, and I could just take the car with the 19s and they will be swapped out later. I\u0019m excited to be able to get free wear on my tires, but I have no idea how they are going to handle this. Will they come to me and change them while I\u0019m at work (it sounds like this is the answer)? Do I have to go somewhere? I\u0019m in Michigan, so no service centers here&\n\nAt this time pickup was scheduled for 2/23/2019, but this was too early for me and I rescheduled for 2/27/2019 (yeah, the day before the price drop, no, they did nothing for me). 2/21/2019 at \\~7PM I was informed Tesla\u0019s scheduling system was down but she would update it in the morning, and she did. \n\nAt this point, not much more happened besides me readding EAP (it was easy to remove and readd) and changing my financing amount twice, which was all very easy. I blew up Girl #1\u0019s email with a lot of requests, and I saw she made all the changes on the site the next morning, and then emailed me to confirm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that everything was taken care of, I was pretty much just waiting for some money to move around. I was told I would get a phone call 24 hours before pick up to confirm, but that never happened. I was driving from Detroit to Chicago, and didn't want to show up to no car. I figured this wasn't very likely for me since the car was already there and wasn't a new vehicle being delivered from California. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the way to Chicago, I emailed Girl #1 and told her I never got a confirmation call. She assured me the pick up time was still on schedule, but that she was out of the store for that day and would have someone call me to confirm the appointment. No one ever called me. I ended up calling about 1/2 way to Chicago because I was just too nervous. I was told my car was there waiting for me, so all good! I also asked several times for the car to be charged to 100% for my roadtrip home. When I got there, it was 90%, and by the time we left it was over 95%, so that was good enough for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Delivery**\n\nI got to the store about 5 minutes after my appointment. They took me to the delivery area and then basically said they needed a few minutes to get ready so go have some coffee. It was a little strange since I was late, but whatever. All the paperwork and everything was very simple. I gave my title for my trade in, signed a few pages, it all took about 10 minutes. I then went out to inspect the car. I brought a friend and asked him to try to be level headed and super critical because I knew I'd be way too excited to notice anything. The car didn't have ANY scratches or cosmetic issues like that at all. Even the inside looked amazing, which I was surprised by since it was a test drive car. They really must have cleaned it up before I got there. [Out with the old, in with the new.](https://imgur.com/uUIlRGO)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was one thing wrong however. The rear passenger side door handle does not retract. When you open it, it just sticks open, and the door will not latch shut unless you push the handle back in. The Guy #2 showing me around the car basically told me \"Oh yeah that's because it's cold out\" and I said \"Uh...no. None of the other handles are doing that.\" He then told me \"Well, it's because it's a test drive car. Ya know? The handle doesn't get used much. It'll loosen up eventually.\" I also did not accept this as an answer. It made a bad squeaking noise when used, and I knew it was defective. He went inside and asked the body shop guys about it, and then told me mobile service would call me to come out and fix it. He wrote it in my pickup notes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMobile service never called me. I scheduled service on my app, and then got a call from some Tesla shop in Ohio basically yelling at me for scheduling in Ohio when I live in Michigan. I explained that the app told me I would be called for mobile service if it was available for my issue, and he told me mobile service would call me within 24 hours. They didn't, so I called the shop again, and then they scheduled my fix for 3/15/2019, which is pretty fast imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Road Trip Home**\n\nI'll make this shorter. The built in trip planner said I only needed 1 stop to make it home. ABRP said it was faster to do 2 stops. So my buddy and I stopped at the [St. Joseph super charger](https://imgur.com/9MCsx4n) and ate 5 guys. Before we were even done eating, I got a notification on my phone \"Car at 80%\" and I couldn't believe it! We only needed like 70% or something but this thing charged so dang fast!!!! The I let my buddy drive us to the [second super charger in Marshall](https://imgur.com/KHBa4xM) Michigan. I dropped him off at his house, and then went back 40 minutes to my house and got home with 70 miles left. EAP was awesome, the car was awesome, comfortable, safe...it was amazing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Car**\n\n The car...you all know it. The car is amazing. It's great. It's expensive. But it's worth it (for me). I've been driving it over a week now and I still love it. Waking up to a full charge every morning. Letting it [preheat in my garage](https://imgur.com/HztjpXQ) without having to open the garage because of deadly fumes. It's fast. My commute to and from work is soooo relaxed now with [autopilot](https://imgur.com/B6xo8Nc). I commute \\~70 miles a day so the gas savings are significant even coming from a small fuel efficient vehicle. I went out to dinner yesterday and in the parking garage there was free charging!! So I got to [fill my car, for free](https://imgur.com/dAl3wMr), while eating dinner. It's like magic. Here is [the car](https://imgur.com/j1Ti6rs) after I rinsed it off after getting home today (I live on dirt roads, so it's often very muddy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nThanks for reading. I'd be happy to answer any questions. I also have a youtube channel that I won't link (unless I'm told it's allowed) because I don't want to get in trouble, but I did make a (crappy) vlog out of the day I picked up the car.

We broke it down to the cost of energy per gallon or per kilowatt I still argue that it\u0019s cheaper to buy per kilowatt then it is per gallon. However the opposing argument was that fossil fuels are still used to make the electricity that goes into our charging stations therefore it doesn\u0019t matter.

      "text": "This forum has provided me with great assistance and looking for some further feedback. I currently commute 72 miles each way to work from the suburbs into NYC. Round trip is roughly 145 miles and could take 2 -2.5 hours each way. Please no comments on the crazy commute. I currently drive an ICE, 2015 Subaru Legacy 3.6, with roughly 75k miles and just paid off the loan today. Of course the fuel savings is tremendous, I figure I could save roughly $150 per month in fuel, even after factoring in electric costs for charging. I can only charge at home and would install a 240v charger in my garage. No charging in my garage at work. So that means a long range model is necessary.  I also learned that I could get a green pass for the George Washington Bridge and save $5 per day, so that\u0019s another $80 per month.  Total rough savings in $150 has and $80 for tolls. Even with that I am having a hard time justifying the monthly payment of a new car. Am I crazy?!  If I traded my car I, I should get roughly $15k for it so that would be my down payment and I would finance the remainder. Talk me in or out of this please!\n\nI am also wondering if a used S model makes more sense given the long commute and the air suspension?  Roughly 1 hour of the commute is at highways speeds of 65-70 mph and the remaining 1-1.5 hrs is in bumper to bumper nyc traffic. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "Just got back from a road trip with my wife from my home in Northern AZ to downtown San Diego in my Model 3 Performance w/FSD Beta v11.3.3.\n\nSupercharging cost vs. gas cost - although I left my home with a 100% charge, my home charging costs are ridiculously low at $ 0.05 per kWh off-peak, so it\u0019s negligible and I didn\u0019t include this.\n\nI only used Superchargers on the trip and didn\u0019t use the heater or AC much.  Supercharger costs were $115.36.  Using current AZ and CA average costs per gallon, a gas vehicle averaging 30 mpg would have paid approximately $148.96 in fuel.  It\u0019s about what I expected; supercharging isn\u0019t cheap but it\u0019s cheaper than gas.\n\nFSD behavior notes - v11.3.3 really impressed me by how much improved it is vs. FSD even a few months ago.  In the city, it\u0019s not hesitant.  My setting is \u001cassertive\u001d, but the car will creep out to make right turns, and will make a left turn at a green light with an oncoming car visible; knowing it will complete the turn before the car arrives.\n\nHighway driving went well too, although a few times I had phantom braking in both FSD and AP.  It seems to occur when the car approaches a slight hill, and also it seems to get fooled at the water \u001cmirage\u001d effect in the distance on the highway.  I took it out of FSD a couple times on the highway as it was hugging the left lane\u0019s outside line and made me nervous until I figured out that it would do this when I was passing a slower vehicle on the 2-lane highway and would hug the outside as I passed, especially semis.\n\nNight highway driving was fine too, but I got a warning that FSD performance would be degraded because of something (those notices turn off too quickly before you can read them IMO).\n\nThe only head-scratcher was a bizarre moment when I\u0019m heading to a SC that I know for sure I can make it easily.  All of the sudden, the car slows down and tries to make get in the left lane to prepare for a u-turn, and the supercharger it now wants me to go to is back from the city I left nearly an hour ago.  I ignored that and took over and when I passed the u-turn point the nav re-calced and then pointed me to where I was going originally. Weird.  Also, FSD seems to change lanes randomly for some reason.  For example, I had to make a a right exit off of the highway in a mile and I was already in the right lane. The car signaled and went into the left lane, and then less than a minute went back into the right lane to take the exit. There was no traffic or other cars.\n\nThanks for the read if you made it this far, and hope this helps!",

I've been growing fed up with how my ICE car had been behaving, and the test drive sealed that my next car is going to be a Tesla. I drive a lot, and the fuel savings alone make for a great reason to upgrade. But, I also had some questions about the app for the car, and some of the lesser known features I didn't have time to talk to my Tesla rep about.  \n\n**App stuff:**  \n* With the app, can you schedule climate settings? Like if I leave at the same time every morning, can I set the car to warm up while I'm getting ready, or would I have to go in every morning and do it manually?  \n* Is there any integration with mobile assistants (Google Assistant/Siri/Alexa)? Being able to ask my phone what the charge level is would be nice.  \n  \n**General Car Things**\n* How is the car in snow? Does the brake regen cause you to slide like hitting the brakes hard would, or is it something you have to learn to finesse?  \n* Is the home wall charger included, or is that extra?  \n* Has anyone had experience with mobile service? I live about 3hrs away from a service center, and will have to rely on mobile until they build one in my area.  \n* Does that acceleration EVER get old?  \n* What's your favorite thing about your Model 3 that surprised you after owning it for a little bit, or a lesser known feature?  \n  \nThanks for all the help, and I can't wait to join the sub for real!",

So, I currently do all my own work to any cars I have, oil, brakes, replacing alternators, water pumps that sort of thing. I do not trust shops whatsoever. \n\nI love everything I can see about the model3. and am really excited about the lack of so many moving parts that make a regular car have the ability to break down., lack of things like water pumps, injectors, fuel pumps, etc in theory should make the car vastly more dependable. But the tradeoff is, IF the Tesla did have a problem at least electrical, its highly unlikely I'd be able to fix it. (I'd of course handle things like headlights, tire rotation etc myself) - So my questions are... in you guys real world experience, are there any common 'major' problems they have that could or have leave you stranded?\n\nI also do live in northern nevada, so it does get cold in the winter... my garage is pretty full, car would need to be outside pretty much, but could be plugged in. I'm told that other than a little loss of range in the cold, this wont permanently damage battery etc. has that been your experience?\n\nAnd the big one for me, is Id like to keep the car for a very very long time. My theory of the lack of moving parts leads me to think it should go well past 100k - does anyone have any real world high mileage on these without having any major repairs?\n\nThanks so much for thoughts! I'm excited about this, I just really want to be sure that I'm not signing up for some massive problem where I have to go to a dreaded shop haha.\n\n:)",

Teslas have been on my radar for quite a while, and I am giving it strong consideration.

I don\u0019t see as many Teslas here as I do pretty much anywhere else when I travel, and I\u0019m wondering if there\u0019s a good reason for that.\n\nDo any of you have experience with mountain life in a Tesla? In particular, it\u0019s important to me to be able to do (ideally) 250 - 300 miles without charging, so my long adventure days on the Blue Ridge Parkway etc. are still an option. I\u0019m also wondering about how it does on rough, rutty dirt roads, and if the clearance is an issue. I keep thinking I should buy a hybrid SUV, but my heart keeps going back to the Tesla. Not sure I can hold out for the Cybertruck.\n\nI think my funds will probably mean I have to do a used one, but it may depend on how the math works out. I\u0019m going to save a whole lot on gas, so my monthly budget is a lot higher than if I was buying a vehicle that needed fuel. \n\nWhat can you share with me to help me decide?

Got accepted into the FSD beta about a month ago, as if there wasn't enough to love about this car already.  Gotta give kudos to Tesla.  This thing looks and drives like it was brand new.  Not a mark on the paint, wheels or interior.  Really great experience so far.  Oh sure, there are the little things, software controlled mostly.

      "title": "So about that rear deck vent / opening in our Model 3... went from open to plugged to fully sealed. My internet re-searching made me chuckle today.",
      "text": "https://i.imgur.com/Ub3Qeb1.jpg\n\n**tl;dr**- the rear deck of the Model 3 used to be open via a large vent covered by the perforated mesh that still remains to this day. Tesla then plugged the hole about a year ago and now cars in the last 6-8 months come with the steel rear deck in the trunk completely solid, eliminating this vent.  There were many speculations of what this vent was for. No one truly knows to this day but the recent development to closed pokes some \u001choles\u001d (pun absolutely intended) in many of the early theories. \n\n**So about that rear deck vent / opening**\n\nI had a 2018 Model 3 \u001coriginal\u001d (sadly totaled it) and now I have a 2020 M3 Performance.  I never even realized the rear deck was open until I had the 2020 M3P and did some internet searching. PS... I\u0019m also the guy that didn\u0019t know our rear seats folded down for a year. LOL. \n\nAnyhow. As I re-read through a lot of threads today on here and other Tesla forums because I recently added an aftermarket subwoofer to my car... I was amused by the posts, claims and some \u001cdie hard\u001d people claiming as God\u0019s truth they knew was it was for. \n\n**Air vent for climate control** - Many claimed it was to maintain climate control in the trunk. Well, it\u0019s completely sealed off now... and no other major redesign of venting to replace this \u001cfeature\u001d that anyone\u0019s aware of. And if they really wanted to climate control the trunk they could have just placed an AC vent in there from the get go.  This didn\u0019t sound logical. \n\n**Air vent to allow air circulation** - Because there\u0019s a vent in the back for air to escape the bumper area, many people claimed it was for air to flow from the cabin to the trunk and efficiently out the rear corner vent. As if the interior is some amazingly engineered wind tunnel and air tight if not for this \u001cvent\u001d. This is preposterous in my opinion. I removed my OEM sub today and could clearly see this vent in the bumper area.   Here\u0019s the problem... that vent (I assume there\u0019s one in driver side too) is 4x8 inches or so and hidden behind thick trunk carpeting and to have what was the original rear deck vent which is huge in comparison as the \u001cair feeder\u001d makes no sense. And the rear seats fold down (and this design creates lots of gaps/cracks/openings even when upright) and obviously the trunk was never air tight to begin with rear deck vent or not. How do I know? Well there\u0019s a reason I put my take out food in the frunk even in the 2020.  LOL.  But yeah, I highly doubt it was for air venting. \n\nMany people swore this is what it was for though. Even sternly warning people who were blocking the hole with something that they\u0019ll experience a big decrease in AC efficiency and even more humid conditions. Yeah... I don\u0019t think so. \n\n**Pressure reduction for air bags and/or your ear drums** - How could this possibly be? The windows crack open and go up after the door closed. And while the trunk doesn\u0019t do this, remember there are the air vents in the trunk by the bumper that allow air to free flow out when you slam the trunk shut. And the car is not air tight once again. This made no sense to me as well.  \n\n**Ambient light for trunk or kidnapped victim breathing hole** - People were joking about captives in the trunk but some did think it was maybe a way to better see inside the trunk on a bright sunny day or when under bright garage lights. I doubt this because it was vented and not glass to act as a skylight.  \n\n**Reducing road noise and the temporary fabric hole plug** - Well, since it was open by default on the first year or two Model 3s... no one thought the hole was there to *increase* road noise but many speculated Tesla provided the gray fabric-like hole plug/blocker as a means to reduce road noise. This is probably true and was a temporary solution for them. \n\n**Subwoofer audio pass through** - This what I always believed and still do but think it was sacrificed in favor of road noise reduction.  Having had a 2018 Model 3, I can absolutely attest to my 2020 premium audio system having much less bass response than my former 2018 Model 3. It was noticeable the minute I picked up my new car but I didn\u0019t know why since I didn\u0019t know about the missing hole. But once I found out I lowered one of the back seats and it was back to what I remember my 2018 sounding like. I have a couple of songs I listen to A LOT and it sounded very different in my 2020. It was so different that it caused me (partially because of pandemic boredom as well) to replace the OEM subwoofer with a 12\u001d JL Audio subwoofer enclosure with integrated 400W amp.  The 2018 with open rear deck vent was just good enough that I never planned on any aftermarket gear for it but something had to be done in my 2020 and I wasn\u0019t about to open up and cut through solid steel to try to see if it helped bass response. The upgrade is now 10X better, cleaner and goes lower because the OEM sub can\u0019t go below 40Hz. \n\nAnyhow... I just found the saga of the rear deck vent / opening to be interesting especially how it played out over time.  From fully open to manually blocked (which fueled some more theories, even someone asking if it was a charcoal filter of some sort =\u0002) to it being completely sealed off on all Model 3s. I\u0019m not knocking anyone as the theories were somewhat sound although they didn\u0019t really make sense to me... but our love for our cars definitely has us incredibly curious about all aspects of our Model 3s.

      "text": "The M3 RWD keeps dropping in price while the Bolt EUV is hard to find and sells at MSRP or higher. What would you say is the deciding factor to go with one or the other? I already have a deposit (refundable) on the bolt and from what I've seen 2023 M3 RWD are plentiful at the moment since everyone wants a MY or M3LR.\n\nHere's the thing. M3 is getting a significant refresh for 2024. Bolt is being left behind for the ultium battery lineup. I would wait for 2024 when the federal tax credit is POS but in my particular situation there's a $4000 state incentive that's probably running out of funds by the end of this month November. Chevy offers a few other incentives as well noteably a free level 2 charger installation. Tesla has the referral thing.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Bolt, I wouldn't be surprised. I've personally never seen one on the road. The bolt premier has some higher end features even the M3LR lacks, but road tripping with slow DCFC charging speed is dreadful to think about. I'm also leaning towards M3 RWD because, theoretically, an LFP battery lasts 2 to 4 times longer than the older lithium-ion battery tech in the bolt. Of course Chevy's LFP tech Ultium is for next years EVs.\n\nI want to keep an EV as long as possible. My current ICE hatchback is nearing 20 years old and it's seen better days. The bolt would be fine as a main commuter (40 mile round trip/ 5 days a week) but for longevity, the M3 LFP battery may be a safer bet. If I got the M3 I could also without hesitation replace my ICE hatchback for the occasional interstate road trip. Yet the bolt is generally more practical, likely has better build quality, arguably better tech hardware, more passenger space, and slightly less expensive. Any thoughts? And no, I'm not getting both.",

I got everything tinted, painted the wheels, chrome delete, all the fun stuff you do with your Tesla. I loved all the technology, when I first got it we had a major heat wave and turning the a/c on before I got in was a game changer. Autopilot has been great for road trips, commutes, and has probably saved me from an accident more than once. The acceleration and speed are unmatched. About 50% of my work place now owns a Tesla of some form.\n\nI still love the car to this very minute, but I'm not sure I can take it anymore. Problems crept up on me and now I want off this wild ride. I can't charge at home, I live in an apartment. I can no longer charge at work, the powers that be decided to take away our access. I've had to resort to super chargers, I found one that only charges 21 cents per kwh regardless of time of day so it hasn't been too pricey in terms of money but due to my commute I have to charge upwards of 3-4 times a week, that's nearly 2 hours a week spent sitting at a charger.\n\nI'm tired of the car payment, I can afford it easily, but seeing that amount of money leave my account each month hurts. The insurance bill isn't much better and don't get me started on the registration bill. I don't pay gas tax but I'm definitely overpaying compared to an ICE vehicle.\n\nI almost instantly had regrets upon purchase too. Just days after my purchase I found out about the Stealth Performance and Tesla making my beautiful white paint job the standard. I felt ripped off. I could've got a Stealth white Model 3 for the same or less than what I paid for my Long Range AWD.\n\nI found a car dealer willing to pay the remainder of what I owe on the car and get me a new fuel efficient car with payments less than half of what I'm paying for the Model 3.

      "title": "Is a model 3 for me?",
      "text": "Hello All,\n\nI spent quite a bit of time looking at the Golf GTI. I almost bought one the other day but had a bad feeling about the whole thing and decided to walk away. I think I'm looking for something a little more premium since its too similar to my Ford Focus. I've since went back to looking at the F30 330i and B9 A4. However, I drove a model 3 long range this winter and totally dug it. I have a 90 mile round trip to work every day so this car needs to keep me satisfied. \n\nI have a few concerns about the model 3. First I live in central Illinois so the closest service center is nearly 3 hours away in Chicago. I know that Tesla still has quite a few kinks to work out and in the event something goes wrong, how would Tesla handle this? Also, what are some common things that go wrong on these cars? I know its too early to tell what long term reliability will look like.\n\nMy second concern is the cost. While the model 3 promises significant fuel and maintenance savings for the amount of driving I do, the insurance premium is nearly double that of a comparable Audi or BMW. This washes out a lot. I'm also not so sure about depreciation once I've put 100k on it, and simply how it will stand up to the test of time. I could in theory get by with the standard range model that came out if I charged at home every other day, but the long range would be ideal for when I visit family in Chicago. Realistically, will I save that much over a gasoline car? \n\nFinally, I know the model 3 is a grand departure from its competitors in terms of experience. But after a few months of driving, how much of it wears off and how much truly makes a good difference? I tend to get bored of cars so I want to make sure a Tesla won't leave me disappointed soon after. \n\nI'm not sure if I should pay up for Tesla now, or just get a CPO-whatever until the model 3 gets a little better over time. Thanks in advance for the advice. ",

      "title": "New Model 3 LR - Range concerns and experiments",
      "text": "\\[Long and detailed post alert!!! But I hope it would be informative\\]\n\nOkay, so I\u0019ve been having some concerns regarding how much range am I getting on my 1 month old Tesla Model 3 LR (with 19\u0019\u0019 sport wheels):\n\nSo, I bought my car roughly a month ago and drove around 800 miles so far. And when I look at my energy graph, it shows that I drove at an average of 350 Wh/mi.\n\nBased on Tesla\u0019s range estimate of 325 mile for a Model 3 LR with 19\u0019\u0019 sport wheels, and considering a battery capacity of 82kWh for this model, Tesla gave an estimate based on an average energy consumption of 250Wh/mi \\[82000 Wh/ 325 mi (range) \\~= 250 Wh/mi\\].\n\nBut since I drove at an average of 350 Wh/mi, that means I was actually only getting a range of \\~230mi (82000 Wh / 350 \\~= 230mi) with a full charge. And this is with my new Tesla with a battery efficiency being at 100%. Imagine the same thing happening with a 3-4 year old Tesla with battery efficiency being degraded by 10-15% on average (from what I saw on Reddit/YouTube/Fb groups that I follow), in which case I would be getting only around 200 mi on a full charge. This makes me feel that the EPA estimate is just a joke!!\n\nSo, I was curious why I had an average of 350 Wh/mi. I always drive with the temperature set to 70 F with everything set to automatic, audio always ON and I always do use regenerative braking and try to make maximum use of it. So, just some basic stuff did not do anything fancy. (Not sure if there are any other major factors to consider, that I might be missing).\n\nSo, to test it out I did some experiments and checked the average for all of those trips:\n\n* **450-500 Wh/mi:** Regular short trips consume more energy compared to a one long trip:\n   * I noticed whenever it is cold (around 35-40 F, which I think is not even extreme cold), and I go to a gym with 7mi actual round trip, it actually eats up around 15-16mi (with an average of 450-550 Wh/mi for that trip). And since, this is on a  daily basis this might be a major factor in my overall average. I know some of you have suggested pre-conditioning the battery before leaving home, while it is still plugged-in. But, I live in an apartment with shared charging and it is not always possible to plan. And also, warming up the battery just for such a short trip daily wouldn\u0019t make that much sense as well.\n* **270-300 Wh/mi:** This time driving on a one longer trip of 40mi.\n   * I tried driving very consciously, going smooth without any heavy acceleration and always in the right most lane on a constant 60 mi/hr speed. Used autopilot, temperature and everything normal for this trip.\n* **190 Wh/mi**: Another experiment is when I drove for 30 mile.\n   * This time I decided to drive with minimal energy usage, switching off the temperature, didn\u0019t use any autopilot, and did not apply any heavy acceleration. Just drove slow like an old man and used regen braking as much as possible. And, for this trip I ended up getting an average of 190 Wh/mi and that was pretty impressive!!!! I lost only 23mi on my range for an actual 30mi trip (FYI: Most of this 30mi was in slow traffic. So, not sure if that helped a little bit).\n* **320-350 Wh/mi:** All other trips with my regular driving style and other usage\n   * So, the above 2 trips where I had an average of 190 and 270 Wh/mi, were definitely very boring and I wouldn\u0019t want to do that ever again!!\n   * So having said that, looking at the reality I might end up driving at the same 350 Wh/mi for the rest of my life (or may be slightly better once summer starts and if I improve my driving style a little bit. But let\u0019s not consider that for now), which leaves me with only 230mi range as explained before.\n\nWhen comparing the fuel cost overall, it still wouldn\u0019t bother me. Because, I usually charge at an average of 0.25$/kWh (can manage for even less when not a road trip), which is 20$ for a full charge (82 kWh \\* 0.25$/kWh = 20$) which is currently giving me 230mi range. And even if you consider some similar range gas car which gives an average of 30mi/gallon and gas price being \\~4$/gallon in my area (Seattle, WA), for a 230mi it would be 30$ \\[(230/30) \\* 4 = 30$\\], so it\u0019s still a win! So, not losing much here and I\u0019m getting to drive a cool car like Tesla, which I\u0019m totally loving so far!\n\nBut when it comes to the frequent charging, especially on the road trips and it can get very irritating with so many stops and requires a very good amount of planning. \n\nSo, I wanted to hear more and learn from you guys. For people who have been using this car for a long time and have more miles on your car, what is your overall average so far? Am I missing something, any tips and tricks?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/t1d0u4)",

      "text": "Hello all. I took delivery of a Long Range M3 a couple of weeks ago and am really happy with it - it drives beautifully and makes me very happy not to be burning fossil fuels any more. However, some things weren't quite as expected and I wanted to check what I'm seeing compared to others with this model.\n\nLast weekend I charged to 100% because I was going on a road trip and the range showed as 301 miles which is quite a bit off the quoted 348 miles range from the website. I wouldn't expect to actually get the quoted range but if they're saying it has 348 miles range surely it should show this when charging to full? This was the first time we'd driven the car any distance so I don't think it can have been adjusting the number to our driving style.\n\nAfter the actual journey of 220 miles I arrived with the car complaining about only having 40 miles range left, so the actual range was more like 260 miles. It was mostly motorway driving with some smaller roads at the end and we were in chill mode and not driving super-fast.\n\nHow does this compare to others' experiences? Is this normal and I just need to accept it?",

      "title": "Six month review - best purchase ever?!",
      "text": "Hey Everyone! I wanted to share my experience owning my 2021 Model 3 SR+ so far. This sub has gave me so much information over the last few months, so I'd like to contribute. I'll try to touch on the most important parts. Coming from a 2012 Kia Optima that I loved, I actually thought I'd miss it... how absurd?!\n\n# Pros\n\n* **No Traditional car dealership** \\- Just custom ordered online and picked up 3 months later. In and out of the dealership in 20 minutes.\n* **Absolute joy to drive** \\- The ride is quiet and smooth, the acceleration is unlike anything else and the steering is super responsive. It's so much fun to drive! I'm still constantly looking for reasons to drive and I still giggle every time I punch the accelerator. Driving my wife's Honda Civic now feels like some sort of punishment. \n* **Software Updates** \\- My car has gotten BETTER since I first purchased her 6 months ago. With each update I've gotten new or enhanced features like mirror auto-dimming control, Disney +, carwash mode and bug fixes. The app has also been packed with features like live sentry-cam viewing and I can now talk through my car with a monster voice! That made halloween more interesting for sure! Very cool to see Tesla is actively pushing upgrades and staying on top of software. \n* **Charging at home** \\- I always wake up to a \"full tank\", no more going to the gas station! I use the regular 110v mobile charger that came with car and plug it in every time I get home. According to opti-watt, I consume about **$10 worth of electricity every month.** \n* **Roadtrips/SuperCharging** \\- SuperChargers are basically everywhere and the trip planner works great. Absolutely no range anxiety at all. SuperCharging is cool, and gives you some time to grab a bite to eat or take a power nap. \n* **One pedal driving** \\- Because of Regen Braking, you really only use the accelerator to drive. I got used to it very quickly and now prefer it, it's contributes to making the car such a joy to drive. Regen Braking also makes driving downhill very efficient as it feeds energy back to your battery and increases range. It's an amazing feeling to be creating energy like that.\n* **The Tesla App** \\- The app is awesome and allows me to basically control the entire car. I can set/schedule Climate control, making the cabin nice and cozy. I can schedule charging, toggle sentry mode, view live cameras and acts as keyless entry/start so I don't have to carry keys. I can also share directions with the car so navigation is q'd up and ready when I get in. The app makes everything very convenient.\n* **Miscellaneous cool features** \\- Things like, Auto-Fold Mirrors per location, so now when I pull up to certain parking spots, my mirrors fold automatically. Voice commands work really well and come in very handy while driving. The fart/emissions prank is silly and everyone loves it. DogMode is great and very useful.\n* **No oil or scheduled maintenance** \\- No more oil changes every 3k miles! Driving one of the most American made cars on the road and no longer dependent on foreign oil.\n* **AutoPilot** \\- Basic AutoPilot is pretty impressive. It steers, brakes and accelerates for you. It makes morning drives more relaxing. I understand it's a work-in-progress, so I stay aware and keep my hands on the wheel, but it works well for the most part. \n* **Easy to clean** \\- The interior is minimal and really easy to wipe down. The seats are durable and basically stain resistant. I just use a damp warm soapy rag and everything cleans up so nicely.\n* **Mobile Service** \\- My driver side interior pillar wasn't properly clipped in, I just didn't notice at delivery. I scheduled mobile service using the app and a tech showed up 3 days later, fixed the pillar in 5 mins, we admired/chatted about the car and he left. It was perfect. \n\n# Cons\n\n* **Cruise Control Phantom Braking** \\- Using TACC (Traffic Aware Cruise Control) I've experienced a few very dangerous instances in which Cruise Control braked heavily while at highway speeds for no reason at all. This was extremely scary and could have resulted in a bad accident. It makes using Cruise Control nerve-wracking and make me apprehensive to relax on the highway or road trips. **If Tesla had a dumbed-down Cruise Control that only set your speed, nothing more... This car would be absolutely 100% PERFECT.**  \n\\*I fully understand Phantom Braking when using AutoPilot because AutoPilot is trying to drive for you and it's still a work-in-progress. **Cruise Control should work differently.** \n* **My wife wants to drive it all the time** \\- It only took her a few rides and now she wants to drive it everywhere! She's not usually impressed by much, but she is in love with this car.\n\n**TLDR:** This is the best car I have ever owned and possibly the best purchase I have ever made. No buyers remorse at all. Even after 6 months I still make up reasons to drive it and often find myself standing in the garage just looking at it haha.   \nMy only complaint is the need for a **dumbed-down** or **classic cruise control** to eliminate phantom breaking. If Tesla provided that in a future Software Update, it would easily make the car 100% perfect, in my opinion.",

      "title": "Road Trip from Boston to Charlotte",
      "text": "I wanted to share yet another road trip story on this sub.\n\nHere is a picture of my rig  https://i.imgur.com/Gz7Ug1x.jpg\n\nI recently drove my 2022 M3LR by myself from Boston to Charlotte to visit family in the Charlotte NC area (900 miles each way). On the way down I stopped overnight and camped in a Cracker Barrel parking lot. On the way home I drove straight through (15.5 hrs). Below I will detail a few highlights.\n\n**FSD (not beta)**\n\n- I paid $200 for a month of FSD for the trip. Navigate on Autopilot was a nice feature, but IMO not worth $200/mo vs. standard Autopilot. Next time I will likely just use the free Autopilot.\n\n- Using Autopilot/FSD drastically reduced the fatigue feeling caused by driving for extended periods of time.\n\n- Phantom braking only happened once on the road trip\n\n- When starting my drive home at 6am, it was dark and raining. Autiopilot/FSD did a great job getting me past the rain while on unfamiliar roads.\n\n- I'm hoping the 2023 software branch with Beta comes out before my 1 month subscription to FSD runs out so I can play with it.  \n\n**Charging and Navigation**\n\n- I relied on the car's navigation for traffic avoidance and supercharger planning. The estimated battery % upon arrival seemed pretty accurate. I arrived as low as 5% at a few superchargers. The car seemed to modulate the amount of preconditioning to arrive with the predicted remaining % accurately. \n\n- Range anxiety was slightly present on the way down. Range anxiety was non-existent on the way home.\n\n- The navigation had me driving about 2.5hrs between stops. I found this to be perfect. I was ready to stop and stretch by this time. Supercharger stops were 20-30 min. Mostly 150kW superchargers.\n\n- I would pretty much unplug the supercharger as soon as the navigation told me \"you have enough to continue your trip.\"  I would arrive at the next charger within a few % of its original estimate.\n\n\n**Efficiency**\n\n- I drove all winter on 18\" Aeros without hubcaps and was averaging 275W/mi. I recently put on 20\" Uberturbines and am now averaging 290W/mi (~5% hit).\n\n- I think I noticed that driving through warm air causes less aerodynamic drag and is significantly more efficient due to the density difference (driving through fewer air molecules). Similarly, driving through cold rain is seemly less efficient.  I don\u0019t see this reason discussed much when people talk about poor winter efficiency, so I wanted to mention it. \n\n\n**Uberturbines**\n\n- I hit plenty of rough roads and didn't have any blow outs or tire/rim issues.\n\n- I put together a puncture kit before I left (scissor jack, plug kit, 12V pump, etc). Peace of mind more than anything else.\n\n- I see so many posts trashing Uberturbines.  I am still careful to avoid pot-holes whenever possible, but I am no longer constantly worried about my tires/rims after this road trip.  I'm also happy to see the Uberturbines didn't dramatically decrease my range.  I love the Uberturbines more than ever.\n\n- I got a pebble stuck between the brake rotor and dust shield once. It made a sketchy noise, but I instantly knew it was just a pebble stuck behind the rotor. Driving in reverse 10ft cleared the pebble.\n\n- My tires are inflated to 42PSI cold in the New England mornings at 30-40F.  Down south while driving on the highway in 80-90F weather, I saw the tire pressure as high as 50PSI.  \n\n\n**Battery Degradation**\n\n- I started the trip with 10k miles on the odometer and 351miles at 100% SOC. I balanced the pack once while in NC and ended the trip with 352 miles at 100% SOC.  Clearly supercharging a bunch of times over a week period does not hurt your battery pack.\n\n**Camping in the car**\n\n- Pretty awesome to be able to run the climate control all night (camp mode). It was hot in VA when I went to sleep and the climate was blowing cold air to cool the cabin. When I woke up it was cold out and the climate was blowing warm air.\n\n- Surprisingly large puddle under the car from moisture removed from the cabin.\n\n- Camp mode used 1% per 1-2hours (relatively mild outside temperature)\n\n**Ham Radio**\n\n- For Ham Radio operators on this sub, I ran my FTM-400 with APRS pinging my GPS location during the entire trip.  My dad thought this was cool and followed my progress on the aprs.fi website.\n\n- Here is a picture of my setup https://i.imgur.com/Jfedn4D.jpg\n\n\n**Keeping the exterior clean**\n\n- I used \"The Glosser\" microfiber wipes to keep the exterior clean during the trip. Tons of bug guts to clean off the front.\n\n- I used glass cleaner wipes and gas station squeegees to keep the windshield clean.\n\n**Interior Rattles**\n\n- There were a few super rough stretches of road that caused some interior trim rattles to appear that I fixed after the trip. I was annoyed by this.\n\n- Common front drivers side speaker rattle. Followed the youtube videos and fixed with foam\n\n- Passenger side seatbelt adjuster was fixed following youtube videos with felt tape\n\n- Rattle under passenger seat was found to be a little black control box that is clipped to the bottom of the seat \nand was loose. Fixed by putting felt tape between the box and seat frame.\n\n- Rattle in the passenger side door card was found using a frequency generator playing 60-65hz through the stereo and was fixed by sticking a piece of felt between the alcantara trim and door card.\n\n**Family driving the car**\n\n- My sister drove the car. She thought it was really cool.\n\n- My nephew has his permit (16y/o). He became obsessed with driving the car. He wanted to drive the Tesla every time we went somewhere.\n\n- Drove with 5 people in the car for the first time. Tight but OK.\n\nThere are probably a bunch of things I'm forgetting. Long story short, the road trip experience was great...better than ICE road trips I've done.",

      "text": "I\u0019ve road tripped our MYP from NC to NY and back, then to Virginia and back. Was great. \n\nThis past week I drove my family and I from NC to NY and back in our 3LR (figured it would be more efficient) during the winter storm. Took two charging stops each way and cost me only $40 of supercharging each way.  I did spend $199 for a month of FSD/EAP. \n\nThe first three hours was heavy rain and fog. Enhanced autopilot was awesome as it really cut back on my fatigue. I stuck to the road very easily without any problems. In the past in a gas car I could only drive a few hours in the rain or in the dark because I\u0019d get so sleepy but that doesn\u0019t seem to happen with TACC and autopilot. I think it\u0019s because you don\u0019t have to constantly focus so hard on staying in the lane and avoiding hitting cars in front of you.  Anyway, was able to do the whole trip there and back without an issue (whereas before I would take shifts with my wife and still be very sleepy).\n\nThe other thing that impressed me is on my way back I lane changed from the right lane to the middle lane and almost completed the change when a car from the left lane decided to suddenly change into the middle lane without looking and my car automatically swerved right to avoid collision and when the car sped ahead the Tesla resumed switching into the middle lane. It was so smooth. Was very impressed!!  Told my wife about it when she woke up a few minutes later (it was so smooth no one noticed except me).\n\nThen my son had to go to the bathroom when the supercharger was about 1.5 hrs away so I just searched for superchargers and found one at a Wawa\u0019s 8 minutes away. The density of super chargers is amazing!\n\n\nGot to try a little FSD too and it was very cool seeing the visualizations and lane changes but it did not seem to succeed on any of my turns; was a bit disappointed. And it\u0019s annoying that it likes to go to the left lane even without traffic in front of you, or even if you\u0019re only 1-2 miles away from a right turn.",

The night before she told me she was nervous, so I had to give her a tutorial and let her drive around the neighborhood to get comfortable. \n\nThe next morning, I took her car to the service center (it's on my way to work). I was cursing the whole time. No autopilot, constant noise, no regen braking, tubo-lag (fucking turbo-lag is the worst after driving an electric car). I drop her car off and get a rental. The brand new sedan they gave me was even worse (turbo-lag at twice as bad, ugh!)\n\nShe leaves after me and when she gets to work she comments on how nice the drive was. Very smooth. Faster drive, because she used the carpool lane (Los Angeles, HOV purple sticker). I'm glad for her.\n\nEnd of the day she calls me and tells me how everyone she worked for wanted to see the car. She bragged to them about how she can turn on the A/C from the office. Her commute home was faster and 'more comfortable'.\n\nI, on the other hand, am in ICE hell. Bumper-to-bumper traffic in a gas car sucks. I return the rental, get her Q5 and make my way home. \n\nAt home she reminds me how nice the car was and jokingly asks if she could use it today as well. Ha Ha, NO.\n\nToday, she has asked at least three times how 'her car' is doing. Dammit, I should have had her drive the shitty rental A4.\n\nTL/DR; Don't let your spouse use the Model 3 if her car needs service. Period.",

      "text": "After 5 years here is a summary of my experience with my 2019 Model 3 Long Range with FSD for anyone who might be wondering about the car after extended ownership. \n\nOverall,  I love this car and it still looks great.  The fact that black was the free colour back then is nice since every Tesla I see nowadays is a grey Model Y.  At the time a lot of people were blacking out the chrome and I am happy I didn\u0019t since it is again unique compared to many on the road.\n\nMaintenance Summary Years 1-4 (warranty period);\n- Replaced back window glass (warranty)\n- Replaced a cracked windshield.\n- Replace control arms (warranty)\n\nMaintenance Year 5\n- Horn stopped working - $435\n- Compliance arm replaced - $2300\n- Charge port door stopped working - $400\n\nThe car has had a few problem since warranty ran out but I save approx $2500/year on gas so I am ok with it but hoping I don\u0019t see a similar spend in Year 6 or I might start to question the long term reliability.\n\nI have driven it 81000 km\u0019s and at  100% charge I still get 435km.  I charge at home with a No adapter and a dryer plug in my garage.  I exclusively use the mobile charger that came with the car.\n\nI wish I had the new centre console since my USB  ports are USB-A.  I put in an after market wireless charger since the lightning connectors cables won\u0019t fit the larger model iPhones on the console.  I also ditched the original aero wheel covers this year to the ones in the photos that I got off Temu.  They do a nice job of hiding 5 years of curb rash.  \n\nI live in the Toronto area and the automatic wipers are awful in winter weather.  My #1 pet peeve however is the navigation still does not account for the HOV lane on highway 404.  FSD improved dramatically with V12 but without a good navigation system it is bothersome to have the car always want to leave the HOv lane.  \n\nThat all said, the car is fast, sporty and fun to drive.  Battery still holds good charge and I get regular software updates.  \n\nI will see you again for my 10 year update. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Why I Chose the Model 3 RWD over the Model 3 LR",
      "text": "Hello everyone, if you were wondering if you should go for the Long Range Model 3 or the RWD Model 3 like me, maybe you can benefit from my post. I live in Southern Ontario, and my daily commute is about 60 km round trip. My current car (old car) is (was) a 2013 Genesis Coupe. I have loved this car and I will miss the manual transmission, but it's time to move on and I cannot justify an ICE car. I have done a ton of research into the different trims of Model 3 and I have looked into buying used vs buying new as well. I have decided on buying a new 2023 Model 3 RWD. This was not an easy decision, but I have decided to go with the RWD over the LR for the following reasons:  \n1. **LFP Battery.** The biggest reason was the new LFP battery. Though less dense, it will last a lot longer and can be charged to 100p. I believe it's rated to go 750k km. Thats ALOT. I won't have to worry about degradation for the most part, and for me, that is my biggest concern with EVs. It affects resale value, anxiety, and range over time.  \n2. **Meets My Needs.** I don't need the extra 100 km. I don't need better audio. I don't need an extra 2 seconds shaved off my acceleration from stop. This car is already leaps and bounds better than my current car.  Acceleration from 30-60 is very similar across all trims too.   \n3. **Save 12k**. The price difference between the LR and RWD Model 3 is about 15% ish. I am financing the car, so that means less interest and smaller monthly payments. The interest rates now are already high, shaving the price down now makes a big difference over time. I'm already spending 400 a month on gas, and after down payments, my payment will be the same. Currently, federal rebates are 5k for both cars, so this isn't a factor. Ontario as of 2023 does not give cash rebates for EVs. \n\n4. **Lighter Car.** Only by 200 pounds ish, but still, better for cornering.  \n5. **White Seats.** In Canada, the LR did not have the white seat option. This a small factor, but still a factor.\n\n6. **Range**. The range is plenty good for my needs. Over time, the gap between the LR and the RWD will close when it comes to the max range due to degradation rates between NCA and LFP batteries. I plan on keeping this car for at least 5-6 years.\n\n7. **Winter.** Honestly, with winter tires, my Genesis was fine. This car will be fine too with winter tires. I have talked to a few people with the RWD that have had it in our Ontario winters, and they said it was fine. I was worried about the LFP battery in the winter, but I can deal with the estimated 300 km range in the winter. \n\n8. **I'm not into showing off**. I know I'm buying a Tesla, but I am buying the CHEAPEST Tesla. There is some comfort in that. \n\n9. **RWD M3 is the most efficient Tesla ever built. Nice.**   \n\n\nHope this helps anyone trying to decide.",

No they're not perfect and everybody wants to point out the imperfections and how they saw a Tesla on fire somewhere and how long it takes to charge, again people just don't get it. \n\nLast week I dropped my Dodge Charger Hellcat off at the dealership for some service. It's a 2020 dodge hellcat with 10,000 miles on it. \n\nImmediately after I dropped it off an employee disabled the BS Dodge tracking device, drove the car off a lot and my guess is based on the police report that my vehicle is already in a container being shipped to South America. \n\nThe 1970s white trash mentality management at the dealership says that they don't have any camera footage to share with me, they don't know where my car went after it was parked in the back and literally told me to contact my insurance company after I make a police report. \n\nTesla is changing the way we do business. I feel confident that something like this will not happen in the future. Tesla is forcing the other brands to change and one day this sort of thing won't happen to anyone because we all be driving a Tesla like vehicle with Tesla like influenced Technology.  \n\nOnce again the people that don't drive a Tesla simply don't know what they don't know!",

      "text": "Today is one year to the day since picking up my Model 3.  My number one thought is - the perfect family car.\n\nWith two SUVs in the garage - I'll be honest - I bought the Model 3 for ME!  The first few weeks you would have thought I bought a 911.  Beat every car at every stop light, washed it every weekend, and cried the first time I scraped a wheel.\n\nBut as the weeks and months progressed new feelings emerged.  We (wife, 2 kids) started using the Model 3 for every trip (even long ones).  Here are my thoughts on why -\n\nSAFETY - When you feel your kids are safe you are much more at ease.  Your kids drive so many of your decisions but when I pulled the trigger on the Model 3 purchase I actually felt like I was robbing my kids.  Thinking about how much $50K+ could boost the college funds, I almost did not complete my order.  All the sensors and warnings add up to a more comfortable feeling on the road.  The warnings are accurate and there are very few false positives.  My daughter is adamant about auto-pilot when I reach for my phone.\n\nFUN - The Model 3 is just a joy to be in when traveling.  The glass roof and panoramic views definitely help but until you have a car full of 12-year old boys playing with \"emissions mode\" you have not lived a full life.\n\nENTERTAINMENT - Best User Interface on the road.  Zero learning curve and my wife and kids can alternate playing DJ.  Everyone gets to hear what they want and because there is a sense of control, the bickering and nonsense has almost completely gone away.\n\nGOLF CART - Many friends called the Model 3 a Golf Cart when we got it.  Upset me a little but I definitely don't hear that any more.  But I think about my brother who lives in a fancy golf-course community and they have a true golf cart in the garage.  They tell me how great it is to be able to use it to run to the pool or take the kids to a friends house.  With kids, there is a lot of running around.  With the Model 3, it just \"feels\" better only having to step in, press the accelerator, and run to the school, practice, store, sleep-over, friend's house and the hundreds of other short, barely-planned trips you make every month.\n\nCALENDAR - This has been one of the best adds.  It was automatic to use it for work as most of my appointments had an address.  Now when I know I will be picking up or dropping off the kids, I always add the address to my calendar.  Stress decreases one order of magnitude.  Leave meeting, click-click, arrive at the game or one of their new friend's house without 4 texts to the wife navigating a new subdivision.\n\nENVIRONMENT - Since we now own a car that doesn't use gas, the kids have naturally asked a lot of questions about emissions and the environment.  The discussions have been excellent and they show a maturity beyond their years on all the layers which we have an effect on the environment.  As a parent, it feels great to see your kids taking actual steps to reduce and re-use and not treat environmental problems as something \"they simply can't do anything about\".\n\nAnd yes, the kids love being dropped off in a Tesla.  We were the first Model 3 at the school and I now count 5 or 6 but they still always want me to take the Tesla.  \n\nSeriously looking at the Model Y for the next vehicle...",

      "text": "One week in, here are my thoughts\n\n1. Best car I have ever owned. Previous cars were BMW 335 and 525, which I loved&but this car is better in several ways. Drives better, rides better, better visibility.\n2. The turn signals are&super easy and intuitive. What\u0019s the fuss? SO EASY!!\n3. White interior is beautiful and easy to keep clean. As many other people have said, just keep a can of any kind of interior wipes on hand.\n4. I installed the Tesla wall charger the day before I picked the car up, I plug it in every day and keep the battery at 80% as per Tesla\u0018s recommendations. Just so easy.\n5. Fit, finish, and build quality are top notch. Literally zero rattles. I believe the driver door might be slightly misaligned due to a \u001ctapping\u001c noise it makes right when I close it, kind of like a \u001ctap-thunk\u001dinstead of just a \u001cthunk\u001d. I have a service appointment next week to have that looked at.\n6. After driving this for a week, and then driving my gas powered 335, the Bmw just feels& Stupid and old? Clunky, noisey, sluggish.\n7. Several days ago I had the fronts tinted with 50% ceramic, rear passengers and back glass at 35% ceramic, and sunroof with 20% ceramic. Initially I was afraid the sunroof was too dark, but then yesterday was very sunny with the sun directly overhead, and realized I\u0019m very happy with it. Plenty bright inside the car still but no excessive glare. Although I can\u0019t tell if the car heats up any slower, or if it heats up less, I can definitely tell that I do not feel the heat from the sun on my arms or on my head while I am in it. Ceramic works.",

      "title": "Moving from a BMW M3 (F80) to a M3P - my initial thoughts and experiences.",
      "text": " A month ago, I swapped my 2017 BMW M3 (which I shall refer to as the F80 to avoid confusion) for an M3P.  I thought I would share my experiences for anyone else considering moving from a performance ICE car to an EV.\n\nFirst of all, a couple of comments about the F80; I picked it up in Munich with my family and we had a great drive through Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland and France, ending up in Nice.  The car was a blast to drive and I enjoyed every minute of owning it.  The interior fit and finish was comfortable and very high quality.  However, I have long been intrigued by EV's and the Tesla philosophy and after a couple of test drives and much encouragement from other Tesla owners, decided to take the plunge.\n\nThe order process was very straightforward and I was able to adjust my delivery date by a couple of days with the help of my SA, who was extremely helpful.  The delivery process was smooth and the car had no detectable issues.  I couldn't find any panel alignment problems and the USB C ports and wireless chargers were installed.  \n\nAs far as comparing the actual driving experience, the M3P is an order of magnitude more fun than the F80.  The acceleration is sublime and while the F80 was fast and responsive, you just can't beat the instant response of the M3P.  The F80 had three different throttle settings; efficient, sport and sport+.  I did most of my driving in the efficient setting as the sport settings were a bit twitchy for driving around town, but when I wanted to open it up and have fun, the two \"M\" buttons on the steering wheel made it easy to switch.  I was a bit worried that I would miss this with the M3P, but the way the accelerator works makes it very easy to drive in stop and go traffic, but when you want to go into warp mode, just press the pedal harder and that's it!  I also didn't realize how much gear shifts annoyed me until I drove another ICE car after having the M3P for a couple of weeks.\n\nSince the center of gravity is so low, the M3P feels solidly planted to the road and the ride while firm is very comfortable.  I've yet to take it up into the mountains of North and South Carolina (which were a blast to drive in the F80), so I'll see then how it really holds up to seriously twisty roads.\n\nI bought the FSD package fully knowing that it wasn't worth the money.  I am fascinated by the technology and wanted to experience it first hand.  I don't have the FSD beta yet, but I've tried the TACC a few times.  Unfortunately, for me, phantom braking is real and on the roads I want to use the cruise control it is unusable.  I think it has to do with bends that makes the car think I am heading straight for the oncoming car in the opposite lane.  Still, I am hoping that this issue is resolved soon.\n\nMy daily commute is about 20 miles total so I don't have any range issues.  I have a Tesla wall charger at home and it takes about 45 minutes to recharge.  It's nice not to have to stop at gas stations any more.  Not to mention that it costs me about $0.30 to top up each night and less than $5 for a full tank of electrons.\n\nAnother thing I was a little apprehensive about was the relatively spartan interior.  The F80 was a refined, somewhat plush and very comfortable experience inside.  While the some of the interior materials of the M3P (most notably the finish of the doors and door open and window buttons) are not quite to the same level as the F80, the interior doesn't not feel at all cheap and I really don't miss the gauge cluster in front of the driver as much as I thought I would.\n\nObviously, one of the major differences between the F80 and the M3P is utilizing the large center touch screen to access nearly all the car's functionality.  BMW's iDrive system was often criticized as being clumsy and difficult to use, but I found it pretty straightforward.  Being able to navigate a fairly complex (but logically laid out) menu system is quite easy when you can keep your hand on the controller and the amount of time I had to take my eyes off the road was minimal.  I was surprised how quickly I became accustomed to the Tesla interface.  I still find myself looking at the screen a little more than I did with the F80, especially when pressing several buttons/icons in sequence as you have to move your hand to a new location with each press, and the lack of tactile feedback can increase the incidence of wrong button presses.  That changed a bit with the V11 update.  Many people have complained that actions that only required one button press now require multiple presses, something which is not optimal when you are in traffic.  Human interface design is a non-trivial exercise and frequently compromises need to be made between interface complexity/clutter and organization.  I think V11 has reduced clutter on the top level screen for the sake of organization, but lost some of the easy functionality that is needed when you need to pay attention to what is going on outside the vehicle rather than the big screen in the middle of the dash.\n\nIt would also be nice to have easy access to my iTunes library through the BT stream source.  I've had this on every vehicle I've had since 2010 (BMW, Nissan and Ford), not to mention multiple rental cars of varying makes.  I'm not sure if this is a licensing issue or not.\n\nAll in all, I don't regret my switch from the F80 at all.  While there are a few minor annoyances, the overall experience more than makes up for it.  My 5 year old is a big Doctor Who fan and when I came home with the new car and played the Tardis sound through the Boombox while I drove down the driveway, her face lit up with excitement.  That was almost worth the price of the car!",

      "title": "I went from a 2019 GT-R to a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance and regret nothing.",
      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I've read a few posts about the comparison to the Tesla M3P to higher priced cars; I think the premise is 'Is the car amazing? Or is it amazing if your coming out of a \\(insert economy car here\\)?](https://preview.redd.it/bnjok4ygp0151.jpg?width=3300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee02cf829c16bdfccc8198d26480c1bc10b204ed)\n\nAs a now former owner of multiple R35 GT-Rs with over 20,000 miles on all of them (My last one being the white one that was poorly shot after a quick wash) I can say without question that the Tesla has been the best car I've driven (and I've driven a few $200K exotics as well).\n\nWhat does the GT-R do better? Traction. The ability to exit out of a corner and have the car shift its weight around to assist you is truly unlike any car your going to get at under $100K. High speed cornering. Steering at higher speeds in R mode is kind of a mind bender-that something so large as the R35 can dance with little body roll, and under control. It makes you feel like a hero and it\u0019s amazing agility never seems to get old. \n\nThe interior, devoid of mass market constraints, is built better, with better wearing plastics and little touches, like carpeted lower interior door panels that help with avoiding scuffing. The carpets are more finely textured. All the switches move with more \u0018heft\u0019 with the exception of the control stalks on the steering column-which are from Nissans FM platform that are 15 years old and feel that way-a win for Tesla who\u0019s Mercedes stalks are some of the best in the business. Not to mention the infotainment system is the same one you\u0019ll find on any Nissan BOV SUV-it\u0019s slow, dim witted, and Apple CarPlay would work infrequently. The LCD display within the instrument cluster is just embarrassing as well. The Tesla feels like it\u0019s from another solar system in comparison.\n\nIt's far more stable maneuvering at triple digit speeds; the Model 3 suspension allows far too much roll for a product with this much ability, and the seats can be far better for high G maneuvering in comparison. The braking force and feel of the R35 is also supercar level, meaning that you literally can place the car in small spaces during traffic maneuvers and brake late during cornering exercises-huge calipers will bring you down to speed with little issue, and wonderful modulation. The Model 3 lags badly in this regard, even with regen braking, as there is a 'softness' at the top of the pedal travel that is not there in comparison with the Nissan. The M3P also has the worlds worst 20 inch wheels, coming from forged wheels in the GT-R and now having multiple bends in my Teslas wheels after 3,000 miles is frustrating vs. none in 4 different GT-Rs. Cast wheels on a car this heavy frankly suck.\n\nWhat does the Model 3 Performance do better besides the infotainment? Every thing else. It's the little things: if you want a gap in traffic, it's yours. There is no waiting to spool the turbos, no loud embarrassing exhaust noise to signal to others that your opening up the throttle, no pauses everywhere that are inevitable even in the best ICE supercars. You just GO. The steering isn't as commutative as the mechanical rack on GT-R, which I do miss, but it doesn't tramline either and require you to concentrate all the time to keep the car from following ruts in the road, even if the R35 is actually pretty good vs other cars I\u0019ve driven like the GT350 R. It also doesn't smell like gasoline when temps hit the mid 80s like the Nissan, it can allow you to relax a bit on long journeys and the tech is literally 16 years ahead of Godzilla. The Tesla doesn\u0019t cook your legs like the GT-R-I barley used the heat in the winter as the car would radiate it when it warmed up which wasn\u0019t pleasant in the summer. And while it cost me $58 a week to gas up the GT-R,  I'm down to $7.18 per week in electricity costs for the Tesla.\n\nIt's a new and exciting driving experience. While supercars can enhance the traditional drive to a 10, I can't really remember them all; sure they were fast, and I've driven on some truly epic roads in them, but any Tesla I've driven has been a different yet somehow a very fun more memorable standout experience in their own right. The Model 3 requires you to drive different from an enthusiast POV, but once you get the hang of it, listening to tire cues rather than shift points during turns, lifting off early to let the regen slow you down and exit on power like a old school hot hatch becomes second nature. It's also the little things: the ability to just carry your phone with you and forget about a fob; adjusting the interior temp on cold/warm days form your app; the ability to put the car in AP to take a drink of water or to answer emails at stoplights while not having to pay immediate attention. \n\nIf you want 89% of the supercar driving experience sans the noise, you need to upgrade the brake pads and rotors, get a coil-over suspension and sway bars to cut the body roll, get some bolstered seats-and for god sakes, get forged wheels-this car is too heavy to go with anything else. \n\nThe fact that I don't have people following me home or recording my partner and I from their phones anymore when we drive is a huge bonus for me as well. But rest assured with this drivetrain, and basic suspension bones this platform is capable of keeping up with cars far exceeding it\u0019s price on public roads. I\u0019ll miss the Nissans; they were all great cars and the revised model was a wonderful object. But in the end I regret nothing. This is a truly great car, and a revolutionary one in its own right. Enthusiasts that dismiss these things may be a bit short sided in retrospect.",

      "text": "I see lots of posts and comments about how you have to be mindful of cabin over heat protection when managing battery life but never any indication as to why they are using it. Cabin over heat protection is a feature that doesn\u0019t even exist in gas cars and no one bats an eye. But I feel like a bad owner for not using it in my Tesla to save battery life. Do we suffer from just too much available data and features on our car that we feel obligated to use it or are our car\u0019s interiors more vulnerable to heat than every other car out there?",

      "title": "my cross country drive: A supercharger summary",
      "text": "I recently traveled back from New York to Los Angeles in my 2019 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD, 18\" Aero wheels (which I've named Marvin) after spending a couple months with my mom during the COVID-19 crisis.  I decided to head back home to LA since the restrictions are loosening in NY at the time of departure and my mom is getting along well.  I took minimal breaks and doing no sightseeing as I traverse the country, and figured I'd write up my experience for anyone interested.  I'll have summary statistics at the end with total distance, kWh used, efficiency, and total cost.  I'm happy to answer any questions about my trip!\n\n\ntl;dr: 4 days, 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86\n\n\nNight 0/Day 1 -\n\n\nStony Brook area to Ridgewood.  Stayed the night with family there, and did not charge that night.  I woke up around 8 AM and started out west from there.  My first charging stop was in Allentown, PA.  The drive was overall pleasant, through mostly suburban highways.  Most of the driving was 2 lane, very little traffic and autopilot worked flawlessly.  There was a $1 toll for one of the small bridges on my route.  I didn't calculate the total miles and efficiency, but the Ridgewood to Allentown portion was roughly 100 miles at 253 Wh/mi.\n\n\nAllentown supercharging spot:\n\n- Large strip mall.  There's a number of smaller eateries and a drive through fast food place, including a Jamba Juice that is great for breakfast smoothies.  8 stalls all of 150kW speed, I actually got around 120.  During my roughly 30 minutes there only 1 other car showed up.  Unfortunately, there's no obvious public restroom here.  Overall this stop is very clean and well maintained, but unremarkable.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 3.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility (ease to find from the highway): 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic Views: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal price: $14.31\n\n\nDrive to Somerset:\n\n210.3 miles, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- There were some really beautiful mountains and tunnels on the route from Allentown to Somerset.  The winding PA Turnpike through the Blue Ridge mountains was incredible, and rural PA is super pleasant to drive through.  Unfortunately there was a good bit of construction that brought it down to one lane with a 40 MPH speed limit, but due to light traffic this wasn't much of a problem.  Again, autopilot handled this very well, but I took over during the construction zones out of an abundance of caution.  There was a toll on the PA Turnpike, but I don't know how much it is yet due to bill by mail.\n\n\nSomerset, PA supercharging spot:\n\n- Right next to the highway.  The only eatery in the area is a Wendy's which seems to be the only spot with an accessible restroom; the charging spot is between a Verizon, the Wendy's, a car wash, and what I think is a dance studio?  I'm getting my advertised 120 kW of power, but of the 6 stalls I'm the only car here for the full half hour that I'm charging.  This station is well but not exceptionally maintained and clean, but not particularly great.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal price: $13.52\n\n\nDrive to Cambridge, OH:\n\n154.8mi, 236 Wh/mi\n\n- A very nice scenic drive through the forest of western Pennsylvania, the country (OK, interstate) roads of West Virginia, and eastern Ohio.  As soon as I left Somerset it started raining lightly, so I was slowed a bit by that.  I-70W was closed through Wheeling, WV so there was a small detour onto 470.  Autopilot did have a small issue in a construction zone where the old lane lines were still visible and there were diverging lines on the left, making the car think the lane was turning when it was staying straight.  Again, there was a small toll on the highway, but I don't know how much it was due to bill by mail.\n\nCambridge, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a Sheetz gas station less than a mile off the highway, with a traffic light to help you make the left heading back to the highway.  This serves as the primary eatery and restroom in the area; there is a Denny's next door about a 300 foot walk.  Bathroom is very clean, as is the parking lot.  Also in the strip mall here is a Dollar General which I guess you can pick up something if you need to.  Again, I am the only car here out of 8 stalls, pulling 125kW, but it dropped to 100 kW when about 60% charged.  Overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.64\n\n\nDrive to Cincinnati, OH:\n\n177.6 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- I wasn't sure if I was going to stop at this one or Columbus in between.  As I was driving into Columbus I saw that I would have a rated ~160 miles to get the ~100 miles further to Cincinnati, so I went for it and made it here with about 10% left on the battery.  As I entered Columbus and the scenery shifted from wooded to more open plains, the skies opened up as well with large heavy thunderstorms.  These caused autopilot to become unavailable with the \"Take control immediately\" message popping up.  The heavy rains dropped my efficiency pretty significantly for this leg of the journey so I had to slow down a bit to make it to Cincinnati with enough charge to be comfortable.  This was definitely the most strenuous but most enjoyable leg of the journey so far.  Driving through the rain was beautiful and I really felt in control.\n\nCincinnati, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a meijer supermarket parking lot.  It's about 2 miles off the highway with a number of turns and traffic lights to get to it, and the GPS took me in through the delivery/loading docks.  The spots for this charger are freshly paved in stark contrast with the rest of the lot.  Also in this parking lot is a Target, so there are probably accesible bathrooms.  Best place for food is going to be the meijer supermarket.  No garbage cans anywhere near the chargers.  For the charge itself, there's me and one other car charging in the 10 stalls and I started with pulling 120kW but that dropped throughout my charging session.  This is a fine enough location but a bit difficult to find/out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $7.15\n\n\nDrive to Louisville, KY:\n\n104.2 mi, 262 Wh/mi\n\n- Somehow Cincinnati was the first city that I actually drove through and not just around.  I got a good view of the baseball and football stadiums from the highway, and the roads were very manageable.  On the woodsy highway through Kentucky, I was surprised how many highway patrol cars I saw with their lights off in the shoulder after dusk.  I finally checked in to my hotel around 10PM after a very full day of driving.  My hotel is about 3 miles from the supercharging station and I forgot to track my actual distance and usage for this short bit.\n\nDay 2:\n\nLouisville supercharger:\n\n- Located at a college annex building's parking lot, the associated bakery has been sadly shut down.  The stalls are nice and well kept but I didn't note my actual power draw while there as I walked over to the bakery to find it closed instead.  There are no garbage cans in this lot, and there is a coffee shop in easy walking distance across the street.  The station is right off the highway and it's very easy to get back on.  There was 1 other car there out of the 8 stalls.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: ??/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.94\n\n\nDrive to Bowling Green, KY:\n\n113.5 mi, 271Wh/mi\n\n- Another rainy segment as the skies parted as I exited Louisville and closed again when I entered Bowling Green.  Mostly 3 lane highway, very easily navigable.\n\nBowling Green, KY supercharger:\n\n- Located at another meijer supermarket, this one is off to the side by a large field.  It's about 4 miles off from the highway, making it less accessible for road tripping purposes.  It's a very pleasant suburban drive down to the charger along relatively large county roads.  Other than the meijer, there are no shops or eateries in easy waling distance.  I'm the only car here of the 8 stalls, pulling between 100 and 115kW.  Overall it's a nice spot if a little out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 4/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Dickson, TN (West of Nashville):\n\n102.5 mi, 264Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped for lunch with a cousin in the suburbs.  Very easy pair of segments.  Nice transition into mountainy roads, beautiful scenery and view of the Nashville skyline on the way.\n\nDickson, TN supercharger:\n\n- At a Holiday Inn Express, 2B appears damaged like someone backed into it.  I'm the only car here at the 8 chargers getting 130 kW.  There's a restaurant nearby in walking distance.  No nearby trash can.  Easy to get here from the highway.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Jackson, TN:\n\n94.6mi, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- Nothing special, but very pleasant.  Good wooded road well paved and fast moving.\n\nJackson, TN supercharger:\n\n- By far the nicest supercharging spot that I've been to so far on this trip.  Unfortunately, the spot is a bit awkward to get to from I-40W as the exit takes you one way and you need to take a U-turn on a surface street.  Luckily, that side street goes by a number of drive-throughs and I got my guilty pleasure that's only a southern thing - Cookout.  Had I not, I would have gotten to eat at the general store, a traditional bakery and had time to explore a small gift shop and train museum, or even play a round of mini-golf (were it not closed due to the pandemic).  There was a classic Pullman car directly in front of the chargers and this was a really cool atmosphere.  I highly recommend a stop off here even if it's just to top off.  I didn't pay attention to my charging speed, but it was plenty fast.  I was the only car of 8 stalls.  There are also a few Blink chargers installed next to the Tesla ones.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: ?/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.52\n\n\nDrive to Memphis, TN:\n\n74.9mi, 267 Wh/mi\n\n- Another wooded segment very similar to the last.  Unfortunately due to the turn off onto I-240 I didn't really get a good view of the Memphis skyline, but that's fine.\n\nMemphis, TN supercharger:\n\n- In a strip mall next to a free standing First Horizon bank.  Good accessibility from the highway and a number of eateries in the area.  Not sure where would be a good bathroom here, but the Taco Bell nearby could be a nice option.  Very clean but no garbage cans near the chargers. I'm one of 2 cars here and I'm pulling around 90kW, the slowest charge I've had all trip.  Nothing special, a little slow, but you can't go wrong here.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.89\n\n\nDrive to Little Rock, AR:\n\n168.5mi, 245 Wh/mi\n\n- I took a small detour to see the exterior of Graceland on my way out of Memphis; it was cool but not too exciting from the outside.  The landscape opened up a bit from the wooded background to more of a mix of farmland and wooded areas.  Nice view of Little Rock going through the city.  The highway had very little construction throughout my drive, and the only traffic I experienced was due to an accident in Memphis itself.\n\nLittle Rock, AR supercharger:\n\n- This one is in an outlet center between the mall, a Hooters and a movie theater.  The view here is also pretty nice with flower beds and excellent landscaping all around.  It's very close to the highway, though the GPS took me off an exit too early.  Very easy to get back onto the highway.  No garbage can right at the chargers, but there are plenty in the mall itself.  I'm one of 2 cars here in the 10 spots, pulling around 140 kW.  Overall, it's a really nice place for a stop off.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 4.5/5\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.08\n\n\nDrive to Texarkana, TX:\n\n135.3 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!  Once again a heavy thunderstorm restricted my ability to use autopilot for a good stretch of the drive.  I had to take over manually for a while, and even when cruise control returned the auto lane change was disabled.  The bolts of lightning across the sky made for an incredible backdrop\n\nTexarkana, TX supercharger:\n\n- At an Olive Garden on the outskirts of a mall.  It's right up against a one-way highway service road, and if you miss the turn off into the parking lot then it's a long way back.  If you're not from Texas, navigating the service roads can be tricky.  I missed a right turn ramp to make a U-turn which added 2 miles to my trip from the exit ramp to the charger.  Definitely confusing if it's your first time here and coming in on I-30W.  The station itself is nice enough.  I'm the only car here of 8 spots and I'm getting roughly 135 kW.  Seems well maintained, but finding it was a little bit of an issue.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nDrive to Sulphur Springs, TX:\n\n97.5 mi, 299 Wh/mi\n\n- The speed limit jumped up to 75 for almost the entirety of this stretch, which really drove down my efficiency as I set cruise control to 82 MPH for almost the entirety of the stretch.  I saw a few ranches along the way and a couple really huge churches.  Really easy drive.\n\nSulphur Springs, TX supercharger:\n\n- In a stand-alone parking lot next to a police station.  To get here from the highway, there's a quick turn off ramp that you'll need to cross a couple lanes within 500 feet of the highway exit to make the right.  To get to the charger, it's about a 2 mile scenic drive through a residential neighborhood and a classic American small town main street that I would love to come back to visit.  The Tesla spots are a nice brick paving, and well maintained.  Of the 8 spots, I'm the only car here and pulling 140 kW.  Definitely a great location to park and walk around in.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Arlington, TX:\n\n95.8 mi, 268 Wh/mi\n\n- A transition from the 2-lane highway of rural Texas to the 5+ lane highways of the Dallas metroplex.  Were it not for a thick fog and persistent rain, I would have gotten a great view of the Dallas skyline.  But coming off the highway I got a great view of Six Flags, and it really put in perspective how much taller Titan is than the New Texas Giant (both great rides from prior experience)\n\nArlington, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located behind the e-sports arena, very easy to get here from the highway - less than a mile off of it.  It's got great views of AT&amp;T stadium, Globe Life Ballpark, and a bit of the Six Flags park, with well manicured lawns surrounding this portion of the parking lot; it overlooks a small pond.  I'm not sure how accessible this would be on a game day, but at 10AM on a Saturday with no events it's plenty available.  10 stalls here, and it's me plus one other car.  I'm drawing 100 kW from this very central to activities location.  It doesn't look like there are any food or bathroom options around, but there is a nerby trash can.  If you're looking to get something to eat, use a different charger.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5 (But I can see this being a huge issue if there's a Rangers game)\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.29\n\n\nDrive to Cisco, TX:\n\n121.6 mi, 353 Wh/mi\n\n- Pouring rain until about 5 miles outside Cisco, so no autopilot this entire leg.  Nice open plains once I got further out from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nCisco, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Flying J / Shell gas station with a Denny's.  In addition to the 8 supercharger outets, there's a single J-1772 that appears to be free (I didn't check if it worked).  Bathrooms insude the gas tation, and there are windshield cleaners in the gas station area.  There's also a small outdoor seating area here.  Very easy highway on/off, and a well maintained area.  I'm the only car here, puling arorund 130 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Sweetwater, TX:\n\n86.4 mi, 303 Wh/mi\n\n- I thought this leg was thoroughly uneventful, but it seems as though I got splashed by a huge mud pile on my driver side, so I'll have to find a car wash.  Didn't notice this while driving, just when I got out of the car for a delicious steak fries lunch at a local eatery before charging.\n\nSweetwater, TX supercharger:\n\n- Back behind a Holiday Inn express.  2 other cars out of 8 spots here when I got here, and I'm around 90 kW.  A couple guys rode in on their single wheel electric skateboard type things (sorry, I don't know what they're called), so that was exciting enough.  Garbage can present and the hotel has usable bathrooms.  Fine enough, but nothing great.  No food in walking distance.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.40\n\n\nDrive to Midland, TX:\n\n113.5 mi, 276 Wh/mi\n\n0 This leg was pretty cool to see.  There were a number of oil fields along the way as well as some processing plants.  With that, there was a lot of wide open road and open big country views.  I was just disappointed by about 10 miles straight of road work that was stripped to textured pavement giving a loud, bumpy ride.\n\nMidland, TX supercharger:\n\n- At the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel next door to a Love's gas station.  The souveniers in the Love's shop are pretty cool and very \"Texas.\"  It's right off the highway with easy on and easy off, and not too hard to find.  There's some food in the gas station, but nothing great.  There's a nearby garbage can and the view is pretty meh.  Clean.  I'm the only car here of the 8 spots, drawing around 140 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Pecos, TX:\n\n90.1 mi, 259 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful mountain shaddows in the backdrop.  Wide open road and the speed limit goes up to 80.  I'm surprised how good the efficiency I got was given the speed I was going, and how my AC is going strong (it's 94 F outside with a hot sun up above).\n\nPecos, TX supercharger:\n\n- Extremely easy to get to and very easy to find.  Right off the service road at a Flying J next to the Travelodge.  The travelodge has a nice little gazebo to sit at right next to the chargers.  Good size convenience store in the Flying J with available trash cans and restrooms.  8 chargers here and I'm the only car.  I'm ulling around 130 kW so a pretty good speed of charge.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $1.26\n\n\nDrive to Van Horn, TX:\n\n90.2 mi, 311 Wh/mi\n\n- Mostly wild flowers and small bushes.  My windshield has unfortunately become an insect graveyard.  Super easy drive.  Transition to plateaus is beautiful.\n\nVan Horn, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Hampton Inn.  Only amenity is bathrooms, and there is nothing in easy walking distance of this Hampton Inn.  This stop is very easy to get to from the highway and it's simple to get back on.  Views of the mountains are pretty nice from here with a lot of open space.  I'm the only car here right now, and unfortunately I'm only pulling between 30 and 60 kW (at 4A) so I may be here for a little while before heading to my next leg.  No outdoor garbage can, but it looks like someone left just a bag of trash by the big charger box.  This is probably one of the bottom few stations that I've visited on my trip.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 1/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.27\n\n\nDrive to El Paso, TX:\n\n131.1 mi, 272 Wh/mi\n\n- The drive through El Paso is pretty interesting, and the mountain backgrounds and surroundings on the way in look really nice.  You can get a good look at Ciudad Juarez as well as you're driving in.  I have somehow spent all sunlight today in Texas despite driving West and leaving at 7AM central, along with having no traffic.\n\nEl Paso, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at Rudy's Bar-B-Q (and not the Hampton Inn behind it).  Very easy highway access.  Because I missed my turn in I learned there's a touchless automatic car wash about a half block west of it, and after the long drive today my front windshield had become a Jackson Pollock painting of fly caracasses I decided to give it a go.  Sadly, the right hand side of the machine was broken so I don't recommend using this place.  When I got here, there were 2 other Teslas taking up chargers plus one charger that was ICEd with the family having a picnic in the charging spot next to their truck.  I'm starting to see a few more Teslas now as I'm going west.  The facilities here look pretty fine and well maintained.  Despite sharing 4A/4B (I wasn't going to park next to the truck) I'm still pulling 120 kW.  This is certainly a good spot to stop at, even if it's not pretty and there's no greenery.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.08\n\n\nDrive to Deming, NM:\n\n91.6 mi, 289 Wh/mi\n\n- It was dark out but the drive was easy.  I went through a border control checkpoint to the west of Las Cruces which was really simple.  Now, for sleep after charging.\n\nDeming, NM supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Valero gas station.  8 chargers and I'm the only car here.  Roughly 130 kW of power.  The chargers are off to the side of the building and while they're easy to find the area is poorly lit.  The Valero likely has a \npretty good selection and bathroom, but I didn't go in.  Garbage can is present.  The stop is about 1 mile north of the highway.  No real green space to walk around, but a couple cute cacti around the gas station.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.04\n\n\nDay 4:\n\n\nDrive to Wilcox, AZ:\n\n139.4 mi, 274 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful desertscapes.  Easy drive.  Smooth highway.  After charging the previous night, I had to backtrack a little bit to get to my hotel.\n\nWilcox, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Holiday Inn Express less than a mile from the highway.  Pretty ugly area; next to a large truck parking area.  Garbage can and bathrooms available within the hotel.  8 stalls, and only me + 1 other car, I'm getting around 120 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.52\n\n\nDrive to Casa Grande, AZ:\n\n146.5 mi, 232 Wh/mi\n\n- I absolutely love the desert landscape with the amazing natural rock formations.  This was my favorite set of scenery to drive through so far.  Except for the drive next to Tucson.  Tucson is really ugly from the highway.  There were also a couple instances where the autopilot detected me on the service road thinking the speed limit was way lower than it actually was and causing me to basically brake check myself.  Other than that, it was a pretty smooth drive.\n\nCasa Grande, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located behind a Chase bank in a strip mall.  There's a good set of food options here and the area is well maintained.  3 cars here now with 8 spots and I'm getting 110 kW.  Very easy to find from the highway and exceptionally easy \non/off.  Nicely manicured rockscape around, but unfortunely the chargers are parked such that you're facing into an active roadway/alleyway (this is basically a driveway onto it) where cars are flying down.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $2.50\n\n\nDrive to Buckeye, AZ:\n\n84.6 mi, 226 Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped in Phoenix on the way to do a quick socially-distanced walk through a park with an old friend, otherwise I would have driven around Phoenix and not through it.  But this did give me some nice views of the city's skyline.  Otherwise this segment is plenty pleasant with more of the manicured desert views.  However, Hank Hill said it best.  \"Phoenix is a testament to man's hubris.\"\n\nBuckeye, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Great location just off the highway in a small strip mall at a Carl's Jr.  There's plenty of food options and bathrooms here, and there's extremely easy highway access.  3 cars here including me at the 8 charging spots, and I'm getting roughly 110 kW.  The mall did a fine job on the landscaping but nothing too exciting.  I'll probably make a stop here each time I travel to Phoenix as it's pleasant and on my way.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 4.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Ehrenberg, AZ:\n\n116.9 mi, 291 Wh/mi\n\n- Nice desertscape with a few mountains.  Easy drive.  Very boring.  Almost back to CA!\n\nEhrenberg, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Very easy to get to via a roundabout.  Located between a Best Western and a Flying J that has a Wendy's.  A little bit of open green space in front of the chargers, but there's a giant gas tank on it and a weird smell here.  There are 8 chargers here, and I'm one of 3 Teslas plus 1 ICE here.  For about half a minute I was drawing the full rated 250 kW, but I've settled down around 170 for most of my charging session.  Definitely stop here instead of the Quartzsite location - they're about 15 miles apart on the same highway, but this one offers so much more.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.89\n\n\nDrive to Cabazon, CA:\n\n140.4 mi, 296 Wh/mi\n\n- I've done the later portion of this many times as I visit Palm Desert a few times a year.  The drive through the windmills is really cool.  Nice drive, open highway, this area always reminds me of home.\n\nCabazon, CA supercharger:\n\n- Located in an outlet mall with a really good variety of shops.  Right behind a McDonalds at one end of the outlets, these are all pull-forward stalls, with over a dozen available stalls, but I have had to wait for one due to heavy traffic here in the past.  There's a lot of trash all around here with a dumpster between a couple stations.  Very easy on/off.  One thing different about the CA superchargers - you pay by the kW, not by the minute leading to a much higher total price for supercharging, almost double the rate at other chargers around the country.  I'm getting a consistent 110 kW here.\n\nCleanliness: 2/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $9.24\n\n\nDrive to home:\n\n114.8 mi, 215 Wh/mi\n\n- I live in the San Fernando Valley, so I navigate on autopilot through a variety of freeway interchanges until I am finally home.  This has been an incredible road trip, I just wish it were under better circumstances.  I'm still shocked how easy this was to do and hope my experience can help others as they plan massive trips - it can certainly be done in an EV!\n\nDay 1: 746.9 mi, 257.5 Wh/mi\n\nDay 2: 689.3 mi, 262.1 Wh/mi\n\nDay 3: 917.8 mi, 292.8 Wh/mi\n\nDay 4: 742.6 mi, 258.0 Wh/mi\n\nTotal: 3103 mi, 269 Wh/mi, $130.86",

      "text": "So I\u0019m writing this for anyone who (like me) lurked on here trying to decide whether to buy a Model 3 or not. I have owned mine for a month and here\u0019s my circumstances and thoughts. \n\nMe: I was looking at EV\u0019s because I drive 80 miles round trip everyday for work. I ultimately purchased a 2023 Model 3 RWD.\n\nThoughts: Bottom Line Up Front, I love it. I couldn\u0019t be happier. Before, I had a car that gets 35-38 mpg and I\u0019m still seeing a gas savings even using Superchargers exclusively (home charger is being installed soon). Here\u0019s the math you need to do. My car cost around $40k. Right off the bat with the tax incentive, it\u0019s a $34k car, after total cost of ownership savings (no brake pad changes for a LONG time, no oil changes, no other unexpected ICE issues like exhaust issues, etc) it skews closer to a $25k car. This does not feel like a 25k car. It doesn\u0019t drive like a 25k car. It feels like you ripped off the dealership. Using the charger is easy. It\u0019s not a chore (I either walk around while charging or I\u0019ll watch Netflix or Hulu on the giant screen). The only danger is spending a bunch of money at target while you\u0019re charging. Honestly, after a road trip to NOLA over the weekend, my only gripes with the car are laughably low impact and almost spoiled. One, whoever\u0019s phone unlocks it first has their profile loaded, so if my girlfriend pulls the handle first and I\u0019m driving, I have to switch profiles manually (THE HORROR), the automatic windshield wipers are overly sensitive sometimes (I\u0019m AGHAST) and it\u0019s very quiet so road noise can be a bit much (grooved roads are legitimately loud as hell in this car)\n\nHonestly, my girlfriend summed it up better than I could when we first went to buy it, so I\u0019m gonna use it as my verdict: why the hell isn\u0019t EVERYBODY buying one",

I even had a flat tire once, and the car's alerts helped me manage the situation smoothly.

The FSD and auto park features are fantastic and make driving easy and enjoyable. It parks perfectly every time, even if it takes a bit longer. Honestly, I see this as my forever car.

      "text": "So last week I took over from my wife driving for Lyft part time with our Tesla (she gets anxiety around strangers and I don't get a lot of chance to drive the car, so win/win). I'd love to heard some experiences from others that are doing the same thing; interesting rides, passenger responses, etc. Here's a summary of what I have noticed so far:  \n\n\n1. Something like 95% comment on how nice the car is and how much they like the inside. The other 5% are those that barely speak English or are otherwise quiet on the whole ride looking at their phone.\n2. Only about 2-3% have ever been in a Tesla before\n3. A good 30% , including many that know its a Tesla, still think it uses Gas/is a hybrid of some kind\n4. Everyone is amazed when I tell them how much it costs me to charge fully at home (and really I'm saving $50 on my electric bill compared to before the Tesla thanks to Utah's tiered program that's only available with electric cars)\n5. Just as with cost to charge, no one realizes how affordable it is, even when i mention the one i had was 47k they are amazed. Many think they are still around 100k.\n6. The best ride I've given so far regarding someone excited about the car was to this sweet old guy who apparently does daily trips across town to be with his wife. He was one of the few that I was able to show the acceleration too and wanted to see it (I wont do it unless someone asks/I can do it safely). He said he wished they had him when he younger as he would have definitely bought one. His son just got a Model S but he hasnt gotten to ride in it yet.",

      "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI think this is well within the rules, but if not I\u0019m sorry. So, I currently drive a large, lifted truck that gets a whole 13 mpg. The problem is I do a lot of driving for work and the gas is eating my lunch. \n\nI\u0019ve come to realize that if I sold my truck for around $15,000, I can get a used 2018 M3 LR with AP (some have FSD) for about $40,000. Now, I already am going to get a Tesla at some point. I love the looks, the features, and so on. Currently, I could pay in off in a couple years. (College student but have a company that does pretty well).\n\nMy questions are this:\n\nWhat should I look for? An EV is so much different then what I\u0019m used to.\n\nHow can I see which AP the M3 has? Since the FSD (or EAP) is tied to the vehicle, some of the listing say to \u001ccall Tesla for activation\u001d but how can I know the vehicle can get it without dropping $7k on the upgrade. \n\nMy driving weekly is like 30 miles per day or 150 a week. Sometimes I make long trips but there\u0019s a few superchargers near me. The nearest one is about 30 minutes away but they have the slow charger in my town which is an option.\n\nLastly, one of the vehicles is a branded title for freshwater damage. It\u0019s all in working order, but with an EV, that makes me a little nervous.\n\n\nHopefully this makes a little bit of since, but thanks for the help!",

It is not perfect but it is better in any way than a combustion car. The fact that for you can annoy the hell out of a sports car twice the price of a T3, from traffic light to traffic light is more valuable to me than all the cost saving you can make. It's pure therapy. Now the cons is that It feels I am out of place everywhere. For my old buddies I am a sell out as I jumped on electric, with the average Tesla drivers I have nothing in common.

The drive was overall pleasant, through mostly suburban highways.  Most of the driving was 2 lane, very little traffic and autopilot worked flawlessly.  There was a $1 toll for one of the small bridges on my route.  I didn't calculate the total miles and efficiency, but the Ridgewood to Allentown portion was roughly 100 miles at 253 Wh/mi.\n\n\nAllentown supercharging spot:\n\n- Large strip mall.  There's a number of smaller eateries and a drive through fast food place, including a Jamba Juice that is great for breakfast smoothies.  8 stalls all of 150kW speed, I actually got around 120.  During my roughly 30 minutes there only 1 other car showed up.  Unfortunately, there's no obvious public restroom here.  Overall this stop is very clean and well maintained, but unremarkable.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 3.5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility (ease to find from the highway): 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic Views: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal price: $14.31\n\n\nDrive to Somerset:\n\n210.3 miles, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- There were some really beautiful mountains and tunnels on the route from Allentown to Somerset.  The winding PA Turnpike through the Blue Ridge mountains was incredible, and rural PA is super pleasant to drive through.  Unfortunately there was a good bit of construction that brought it down to one lane with a 40 MPH speed limit, but due to light traffic this wasn't much of a problem.  Again, autopilot handled this very well, but I took over during the construction zones out of an abundance of caution.  There was a toll on the PA Turnpike, but I don't know how much it is yet due to bill by mail.\n\n\nSomerset, PA supercharging spot:\n\n- Right next to the highway.  The only eatery in the area is a Wendy's which seems to be the only spot with an accessible restroom; the charging spot is between a Verizon, the Wendy's, a car wash, and what I think is a dance studio?  I'm getting my advertised 120 kW of power, but of the 6 stalls I'm the only car here for the full half hour that I'm charging.  This station is well but not exceptionally maintained and clean, but not particularly great.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal price: $13.52\n\n\nDrive to Cambridge, OH:\n\n154.8mi, 236 Wh/mi\n\n- A very nice scenic drive through the forest of western Pennsylvania, the country (OK, interstate) roads of West Virginia, and eastern Ohio.  As soon as I left Somerset it started raining lightly, so I was slowed a bit by that.  I-70W was closed through Wheeling, WV so there was a small detour onto 470.  Autopilot did have a small issue in a construction zone where the old lane lines were still visible and there were diverging lines on the left, making the car think the lane was turning when it was staying straight.  Again, there was a small toll on the highway, but I don't know how much it was due to bill by mail.\n\nCambridge, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a Sheetz gas station less than a mile off the highway, with a traffic light to help you make the left heading back to the highway.  This serves as the primary eatery and restroom in the area; there is a Denny's next door about a 300 foot walk.  Bathroom is very clean, as is the parking lot.  Also in the strip mall here is a Dollar General which I guess you can pick up something if you need to.  Again, I am the only car here out of 8 stalls, pulling 125kW, but it dropped to 100 kW when about 60% charged.  Overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.64\n\n\nDrive to Cincinnati, OH:\n\n177.6 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- I wasn't sure if I was going to stop at this one or Columbus in between.  As I was driving into Columbus I saw that I would have a rated ~160 miles to get the ~100 miles further to Cincinnati, so I went for it and made it here with about 10% left on the battery.  As I entered Columbus and the scenery shifted from wooded to more open plains, the skies opened up as well with large heavy thunderstorms.  These caused autopilot to become unavailable with the \"Take control immediately\" message popping up.  The heavy rains dropped my efficiency pretty significantly for this leg of the journey so I had to slow down a bit to make it to Cincinnati with enough charge to be comfortable.  This was definitely the most strenuous but most enjoyable leg of the journey so far.  Driving through the rain was beautiful and I really felt in control.\n\nCincinnati, OH supercharging spot:\n\n- At a meijer supermarket parking lot.  It's about 2 miles off the highway with a number of turns and traffic lights to get to it, and the GPS took me in through the delivery/loading docks.  The spots for this charger are freshly paved in stark contrast with the rest of the lot.  Also in this parking lot is a Target, so there are probably accesible bathrooms.  Best place for food is going to be the meijer supermarket.  No garbage cans anywhere near the chargers.  For the charge itself, there's me and one other car charging in the 10 stalls and I started with pulling 120kW but that dropped throughout my charging session.  This is a fine enough location but a bit difficult to find/out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $7.15\n\n\nDrive to Louisville, KY:\n\n104.2 mi, 262 Wh/mi\n\n- Somehow Cincinnati was the first city that I actually drove through and not just around.  I got a good view of the baseball and football stadiums from the highway, and the roads were very manageable.  On the woodsy highway through Kentucky, I was surprised how many highway patrol cars I saw with their lights off in the shoulder after dusk.  I finally checked in to my hotel around 10PM after a very full day of driving.  My hotel is about 3 miles from the supercharging station and I forgot to track my actual distance and usage for this short bit.\n\nDay 2:\n\nLouisville supercharger:\n\n- Located at a college annex building's parking lot, the associated bakery has been sadly shut down.  The stalls are nice and well kept but I didn't note my actual power draw while there as I walked over to the bakery to find it closed instead.  There are no garbage cans in this lot, and there is a coffee shop in easy walking distance across the street.  The station is right off the highway and it's very easy to get back on.  There was 1 other car there out of the 8 stalls.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: ??/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.94\n\n\nDrive to Bowling Green, KY:\n\n113.5 mi, 271Wh/mi\n\n- Another rainy segment as the skies parted as I exited Louisville and closed again when I entered Bowling Green.  Mostly 3 lane highway, very easily navigable.\n\nBowling Green, KY supercharger:\n\n- Located at another meijer supermarket, this one is off to the side by a large field.  It's about 4 miles off from the highway, making it less accessible for road tripping purposes.  It's a very pleasant suburban drive down to the charger along relatively large county roads.  Other than the meijer, there are no shops or eateries in easy waling distance.  I'm the only car here of the 8 stalls, pulling between 100 and 115kW.  Overall it's a nice spot if a little out of the way.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 4/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.75\n\n\nDrive to Dickson, TN (West of Nashville):\n\n102.5 mi, 264Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped for lunch with a cousin in the suburbs.  Very easy pair of segments.  Nice transition into mountainy roads, beautiful scenery and view of the Nashville skyline on the way.\n\nDickson, TN supercharger:\n\n- At a Holiday Inn Express, 2B appears damaged like someone backed into it.  I'm the only car here at the 8 chargers getting 130 kW.  There's a restaurant nearby in walking distance.  No nearby trash can.  Easy to get here from the highway.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4.5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Jackson, TN:\n\n94.6mi, 260 Wh/mi\n\n- Nothing special, but very pleasant.  Good wooded road well paved and fast moving.\n\nJackson, TN supercharger:\n\n- By far the nicest supercharging spot that I've been to so far on this trip.  Unfortunately, the spot is a bit awkward to get to from I-40W as the exit takes you one way and you need to take a U-turn on a surface street.  Luckily, that side street goes by a number of drive-throughs and I got my guilty pleasure that's only a southern thing - Cookout.  Had I not, I would have gotten to eat at the general store, a traditional bakery and had time to explore a small gift shop and train museum, or even play a round of mini-golf (were it not closed due to the pandemic).  There was a classic Pullman car directly in front of the chargers and this was a really cool atmosphere.  I highly recommend a stop off here even if it's just to top off.  I didn't pay attention to my charging speed, but it was plenty fast.  I was the only car of 8 stalls.  There are also a few Blink chargers installed next to the Tesla ones.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 2/5\n\nSpeed: ?/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.52\n\n\nDrive to Memphis, TN:\n\n74.9mi, 267 Wh/mi\n\n- Another wooded segment very similar to the last.  Unfortunately due to the turn off onto I-240 I didn't really get a good view of the Memphis skyline, but that's fine.\n\nMemphis, TN supercharger:\n\n- In a strip mall next to a free standing First Horizon bank.  Good accessibility from the highway and a number of eateries in the area.  Not sure where would be a good bathroom here, but the Taco Bell nearby could be a nice option.  Very clean but no garbage cans near the chargers. I'm one of 2 cars here and I'm pulling around 90kW, the slowest charge I've had all trip.  Nothing special, a little slow, but you can't go wrong here.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.89\n\n\nDrive to Little Rock, AR:\n\n168.5mi, 245 Wh/mi\n\n- I took a small detour to see the exterior of Graceland on my way out of Memphis; it was cool but not too exciting from the outside.  The landscape opened up a bit from the wooded background to more of a mix of farmland and wooded areas.  Nice view of Little Rock going through the city.  The highway had very little construction throughout my drive, and the only traffic I experienced was due to an accident in Memphis itself.\n\nLittle Rock, AR supercharger:\n\n- This one is in an outlet center between the mall, a Hooters and a movie theater.  The view here is also pretty nice with flower beds and excellent landscaping all around.  It's very close to the highway, though the GPS took me off an exit too early.  Very easy to get back onto the highway.  No garbage can right at the chargers, but there are plenty in the mall itself.  I'm one of 2 cars here in the 10 spots, pulling around 140 kW.  Overall, it's a really nice place for a stop off.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 5/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 4.5/5\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.08\n\n\nDrive to Texarkana, TX:\n\n135.3 mi, 273 Wh/mi\n\n- Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!  Once again a heavy thunderstorm restricted my ability to use autopilot for a good stretch of the drive.  I had to take over manually for a while, and even when cruise control returned the auto lane change was disabled.  The bolts of lightning across the sky made for an incredible backdrop\n\nTexarkana, TX supercharger:\n\n- At an Olive Garden on the outskirts of a mall.  It's right up against a one-way highway service road, and if you miss the turn off into the parking lot then it's a long way back.  If you're not from Texas, navigating the service roads can be tricky.  I missed a right turn ramp to make a U-turn which added 2 miles to my trip from the exit ramp to the charger.  Definitely confusing if it's your first time here and coming in on I-30W.  The station itself is nice enough.  I'm the only car here of 8 spots and I'm getting roughly 135 kW.  Seems well maintained, but finding it was a little bit of an issue.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDay 3:\n\n\nDrive to Sulphur Springs, TX:\n\n97.5 mi, 299 Wh/mi\n\n- The speed limit jumped up to 75 for almost the entirety of this stretch, which really drove down my efficiency as I set cruise control to 82 MPH for almost the entirety of the stretch.  I saw a few ranches along the way and a couple really huge churches.  Really easy drive.\n\nSulphur Springs, TX supercharger:\n\n- In a stand-alone parking lot next to a police station.  To get here from the highway, there's a quick turn off ramp that you'll need to cross a couple lanes within 500 feet of the highway exit to make the right.  To get to the charger, it's about a 2 mile scenic drive through a residential neighborhood and a classic American small town main street that I would love to come back to visit.  The Tesla spots are a nice brick paving, and well maintained.  Of the 8 spots, I'm the only car here and pulling 140 kW.  Definitely a great location to park and walk around in.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 3/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Arlington, TX:\n\n95.8 mi, 268 Wh/mi\n\n- A transition from the 2-lane highway of rural Texas to the 5+ lane highways of the Dallas metroplex.  Were it not for a thick fog and persistent rain, I would have gotten a great view of the Dallas skyline.  But coming off the highway I got a great view of Six Flags, and it really put in perspective how much taller Titan is than the New Texas Giant (both great rides from prior experience)\n\nArlington, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located behind the e-sports arena, very easy to get here from the highway - less than a mile off of it.  It's got great views of AT&amp;T stadium, Globe Life Ballpark, and a bit of the Six Flags park, with well manicured lawns surrounding this portion of the parking lot; it overlooks a small pond.  I'm not sure how accessible this would be on a game day, but at 10AM on a Saturday with no events it's plenty available.  10 stalls here, and it's me plus one other car.  I'm drawing 100 kW from this very central to activities location.  It doesn't look like there are any food or bathroom options around, but there is a nerby trash can.  If you're looking to get something to eat, use a different charger.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5 (But I can see this being a huge issue if there's a Rangers game)\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 5/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.29\n\n\nDrive to Cisco, TX:\n\n121.6 mi, 353 Wh/mi\n\n- Pouring rain until about 5 miles outside Cisco, so no autopilot this entire leg.  Nice open plains once I got further out from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nCisco, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Flying J / Shell gas station with a Denny's.  In addition to the 8 supercharger outets, there's a single J-1772 that appears to be free (I didn't check if it worked).  Bathrooms insude the gas tation, and there are windshield cleaners in the gas station area.  There's also a small outdoor seating area here.  Very easy highway on/off, and a well maintained area.  I'm the only car here, puling arorund 130 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.30\n\n\nDrive to Sweetwater, TX:\n\n86.4 mi, 303 Wh/mi\n\n- I thought this leg was thoroughly uneventful, but it seems as though I got splashed by a huge mud pile on my driver side, so I'll have to find a car wash.  Didn't notice this while driving, just when I got out of the car for a delicious steak fries lunch at a local eatery before charging.\n\nSweetwater, TX supercharger:\n\n- Back behind a Holiday Inn express.  2 other cars out of 8 spots here when I got here, and I'm around 90 kW.  A couple guys rode in on their single wheel electric skateboard type things (sorry, I don't know what they're called), so that was exciting enough.  Garbage can present and the hotel has usable bathrooms.  Fine enough, but nothing great.  No food in walking distance.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 3.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $4.40\n\n\nDrive to Midland, TX:\n\n113.5 mi, 276 Wh/mi\n\n0 This leg was pretty cool to see.  There were a number of oil fields along the way as well as some processing plants.  With that, there was a lot of wide open road and open big country views.  I was just disappointed by about 10 miles straight of road work that was stripped to textured pavement giving a loud, bumpy ride.\n\nMidland, TX supercharger:\n\n- At the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel next door to a Love's gas station.  The souveniers in the Love's shop are pretty cool and very \"Texas.\"  It's right off the highway with easy on and easy off, and not too hard to find.  There's some food in the gas station, but nothing great.  There's a nearby garbage can and the view is pretty meh.  Clean.  I'm the only car here of the 8 spots, drawing around 140 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 2/5\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.96\n\n\nDrive to Pecos, TX:\n\n90.1 mi, 259 Wh/mi\n\n- Beautiful mountain shaddows in the backdrop.  Wide open road and the speed limit goes up to 80.  I'm surprised how good the efficiency I got was given the speed I was going, and how my AC is going strong (it's 94 F outside with a hot sun up above).\n\nPecos, TX supercharger:\n\n- Extremely easy to get to and very easy to find.  Right off the service road at a Flying J next to the Travelodge.  The travelodge has a nice little gazebo to sit at right next to the chargers.  Good size convenience store in the Flying J with available trash cans and restrooms.  8 chargers here and I'm the only car.  I'm ulling around 130 kW so a pretty good speed of charge.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 3/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $1.26\n\n\nDrive to Van Horn, TX:\n\n90.2 mi, 311 Wh/mi\n\n- Mostly wild flowers and small bushes.  My windshield has unfortunately become an insect graveyard.  Super easy drive.  Transition to plateaus is beautiful.\n\nVan Horn, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Hampton Inn.  Only amenity is bathrooms, and there is nothing in easy walking distance of this Hampton Inn.  This stop is very easy to get to from the highway and it's simple to get back on.  Views of the mountains are pretty nice from here with a lot of open space.  I'm the only car here right now, and unfortunately I'm only pulling between 30 and 60 kW (at 4A) so I may be here for a little while before heading to my next leg.  No outdoor garbage can, but it looks like someone left just a bag of trash by the big charger box.  This is probably one of the bottom few stations that I've visited on my trip.\n\nCleanliness: 3/5\n\nServices: 1/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4/5\n\nSpeed: 1/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\nTotal Price: $6.27\n\n\nDrive to El Paso, TX:\n\n131.1 mi, 272 Wh/mi\n\n- The drive through El Paso is pretty interesting, and the mountain backgrounds and surroundings on the way in look really nice.  You can get a good look at Ciudad Juarez as well as you're driving in.  I have somehow spent all sunlight today in Texas despite driving West and leaving at 7AM central, along with having no traffic.\n\nEl Paso, TX supercharger:\n\n- Located at Rudy's Bar-B-Q (and not the Hampton Inn behind it).  Very easy highway access.  Because I missed my turn in I learned there's a touchless automatic car wash about a half block west of it, and after the long drive today my front windshield had become a Jackson Pollock painting of fly caracasses I decided to give it a go.  Sadly, the right hand side of the machine was broken so I don't recommend using this place.  When I got here, there were 2 other Teslas taking up chargers plus one charger that was ICEd with the family having a picnic in the charging spot next to their truck.  I'm starting to see a few more Teslas now as I'm going west.  The facilities here look pretty fine and well maintained.  Despite sharing 4A/4B (I wasn't going to park next to the truck) I'm still pulling 120 kW.  This is certainly a good spot to stop at, even if it's not pretty and there's no greenery.\n\nCleanliness: 5/5\n\nServices: 5/5\n\nAvailability: 3/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4.5/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $3.08\n\n\nDrive to Deming, NM:\n\n91.6 mi, 289 Wh/mi\n\n- It was dark out but the drive was easy.  I went through a border control checkpoint to the west of Las Cruces which was really simple.  Now, for sleep after charging.\n\nDeming, NM supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Valero gas station.  8 chargers and I'm the only car here.  Roughly 130 kW of power.  The chargers are off to the side of the building and while they're easy to find the area is poorly lit.  The Valero likely has a \npretty good selection and bathroom, but I didn't go in.  Garbage can is present.  The stop is about 1 mile north of the highway.

Easy drive.  Smooth highway.  After charging the previous night, I had to backtrack a little bit to get to my hotel.\n\nWilcox, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located at a Holiday Inn Express less than a mile from the highway.  Pretty ugly area; next to a large truck parking area.  Garbage can and bathrooms available within the hotel.  8 stalls, and only me + 1 other car, I'm getting around 120 kW.\n\nCleanliness: 4/5\n\nServices: 2/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 1/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nTotal Price: $5.52\n\n\nDrive to Casa Grande, AZ:\n\n146.5 mi, 232 Wh/mi\n\n- I absolutely love the desert landscape with the amazing natural rock formations.  This was my favorite set of scenery to drive through so far.  Except for the drive next to Tucson.  Tucson is really ugly from the highway.  There were also a couple instances where the autopilot detected me on the service road thinking the speed limit was way lower than it actually was and causing me to basically brake check myself.  Other than that, it was a pretty smooth drive.\n\nCasa Grande, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Located behind a Chase bank in a strip mall.  There's a good set of food options here and the area is well maintained.  3 cars here now with 8 spots and I'm getting 110 kW.  Very easy to find from the highway and exceptionally easy \non/off.  Nicely manicured rockscape around, but unfortunely the chargers are parked such that you're facing into an active roadway/alleyway (this is basically a driveway onto it) where cars are flying down.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\n\nServices: 4/5\n\nAvailability: 4/5\n\nAccessibility: 4.5/5\n\nSpeed: 4/5\n\nScenic View: 3/5\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nTotal Price: $2.50\n\n\nDrive to Buckeye, AZ:\n\n84.6 mi, 226 Wh/mi\n\n- I stopped in Phoenix on the way to do a quick socially-distanced walk through a park with an old friend, otherwise I would have driven around Phoenix and not through it.  But this did give me some nice views of the city's skyline.  Otherwise this segment is plenty pleasant with more of the manicured desert views.  However, Hank Hill said it best.  \"Phoenix is a testament to man's hubris.\"\n\nBuckeye, AZ supercharger:\n\n- Great location just off the highway in a small strip mall at a Carl's Jr.  There's plenty of food options and bathrooms here, and there's extremely easy highway access.  3 cars here including me at the 8 charging spots, and I'm getting roughly 110 kW.

A little bit of open green space in front of the chargers, but there's a giant gas tank on it and a weird smell here.  There are 8 chargers here, and I'm one of 3 Teslas plus 1 ICE here.  For about half a minute I was drawing the full rated 250 kW, but I've settled down around 170 for most of my charging session.

There's a lot of trash all around here with a dumpster between a couple stations.  Very easy on/off.  One thing different about the CA superchargers - you pay by the kW, not by the minute leading to a much higher total price for supercharging, almost double the rate at other chargers around the country.

      "title": "Going back to gas...",
      "text": "\n2013...\n\nThat\u0019s the year I first joined the Tesla Family with a fully spec\u0019d out P85. I, like many of us Tesla fans went full blown fan boy in 3.2 seconds.  It was love at first sight and I was determined to live a long life without the need of gas ever again. \n\nSix months into a blissful ownership experience I had to schedule my first service. I was so excited. Tesla came to my house with a loaner, reviewed paperwork, and took my P85 off for its first regular maintenance (that was a thing back then).  \n\nEverything seemed to go fine until I got a phone call while I was watching my car come back to me on the app. It was the flat bed truck driver. There was an accident and the big straps that secured my vehicle to the flat bed had broken and my car was damaged. \n\nTesla\u0019s response to the accident was horrendous. It took two plus months to get my car back. I had originally requested a new car.  I didn\u0019t want to assume depreciation for an accident that I had no part of and I wanted my brand new unscathed P85 back in original form.   I had plenty of examples of dealerships replacing cars outright under similar circumstances.  They didn\u0019t. The whole experience was shitty and stressful but I stuck with it because I loved the movement. \n\nI should have known then that the next 7 years would be what I can only describe as an abusive relationship.  Every single service appointment had either a minor mishap or full blown \u001cI want a whole new car\u001d issue. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I drop off my 2018 M3P to the service center for the squeaky front suspension issue. I posted about it here because I didn\u0019t like how they didn\u0019t automatically assume this was a warranty repair. So you can read that if you\u0019re interested lol. \n\nI never would have predicted what would happen next. \n\nDropped off the car Friday morning. Nothing was done the whole day. Typical but at this point I don\u0019t expect great customer service so whatever.   That night we had some thunderstorms roll through but nothing that made me fear what I\u0019d hear after the weekend. \n\nMonday afternoon I get a phone call from the service center. My car was caught in a serious flood Friday night. The water rose up over the interior seats, the battery is damaged, and the car would probably be totaled. \n\nNow clearly this is an Act of God and no ones fault.  However, I wanted to see how Tesla would handle this.  I wanted to give them a chance to exceed my expectations. \n\nFirst - they want me to use my insurance.  For many reasons that I\u0019m not listing here. No. That\u0019s not an option. The car was under your care. \n\nSecond - it\u0019s been a week and no loaner or rental has been offered.  I know loaners are in short supply. Offer me something. Anything. I\u0019ve got nothing. \n\nThird - I made an appointment to visit the service center and remove things out of my car. When I arrived, the battery was being decharged and I was told I couldn\u0019t go inside the car for risk of injury. Fine.  They weren\u0019t even going to let me get my belongings or see my car. I pushed back and asked if they could get everything for me since I had an appointment.\n\nI noticed a lot more damage than they told me so I took out my phone to take pictures. You would have thought I was about to set off a bomb. When I took out my phone, a service tech ran over to me trying to grab my phone out of my hand, screaming at me to stop, and told me I couldn\u0019t take pictures without signing an NDA. \n\nI was floored, ready to absolutely blow my top, but I kept my cool because I realized that wouldn\u0019t accomplish anything. \n\nIf I wasn\u0019t already done with Tesla. This did the trick. I couldn\u0019t believe it. He was almost physically attacking me and screaming at me. I had done nothing other than take my phone out. \n\nI immediately called a lawyer from the parking lot. To see what I could do to extract every penny out of them for this damage. \n\nI have no idea how this will play out. Tesla is still refusing to take any responsibility or show any care for me as a long term customer and advocate for the brand. If this were my first negative experience, it would be enough for me to go buy a car elsewhere.  However, this has been the most recent of literally 15 - 20 service calls over the where Tesla\u0019s reaction and support of my issues has been so far below reasonable expectation that it is time for me to walk away. \n\nSo take this cautionary tale for what it\u0019s worth. My experience isn\u0019t everyone\u0019s and I hope that they work to improve this. Because this experience does not live up to the hype that driving the car generates. Part of owning a car is the ownership experience. Tesla is failing at this miserably. \n\nI\u0019m left with no idea of how I\u0019m getting reimbursed, what I\u0019m getting reimbursed for, who is going to do it, and what I\u0019m supposed to do while I have no car.  \n\nI wish you all the best. Those 0-60 runs and supercharger trips have been a blast. But I\u0019m going to give them another 7 years to figure the service and support end out until I come back. \n\nUntil then...back to gas.",

      "text": "Did my first small road trip in the Model 3, from the Bay Area to Socal. \n\nVisited family over the weekend, took my new to me Model 3 LR. Had to stop to charge twice each way, but it coincided with baby feeding and changing so it was not time lost. Paid $90 to drive 870 miles, which while a lot higher than it used to be is still cheaper than gas. I stopped in Tejon Ranch and Firebaugh both times, both had 50+ chargers and plenty of availability, weirdly on the return trip half of the Tejon ranch chargers were busted so it took a handful of plug-in attempts to find a working charger, that was annoying.\n\nThe real benefits are autopilot, and the sheer amount of cargo capacity. Autopilot executed a handful of perfect emergency stops on I5, caught it as I was about to brake and came to a stop smoothly and with authority. I drove around 750 miles on Autopilot and can\u0019t see myself going back. It was pretty rough using autopilot in stop and go traffic, if there\u0019s a way to adjust how intensely the car accelerates that would be awesome (but it\u0019s probably paywalled behind more advanced AP packages).",

      "text": "Long story short I picked up my first tesla (2024 m3p) last Wednesday, 1 day before hurricane Helene. It was extremely nerve racking having a brand new car sitting at my house during an absolute brutal and destructive storm. We had hundreds of trees down and historical flooding and destruction here in western NC. \n\nThis was an incredible learning experience regarding the advantages of having an EV. We have never been hit by a hurricane like this in the mountains before so we didnt take it very seriously, and went into it with low gas in our ICE car. We ended up having a total blackout here, no cell service, the first 2 days all roads out of my city were closed, we still have no power. 99% of gas stations are closed and the ones open have massive multiple hour lines. There was a super charger that regained power about 15 mins from us in the first 24 hours of the storm and there is no wait to charge. We have been able to do supply runs for freinds and families and charge all of our devices. \n\nThis has been an incredible learning experience and eased so many of my worries about switching to an EV. We were 100% better off than gas cars in this situation. ",

      "title": "Thoughts after first 5k miles with 23 M3P",
      "text": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the M3P I purchased earlier this year and wanted to share some thoughts for anyone thinking of jumping in.  \n\nI'll start with some dislikes first:\n\nPaint - I went with white because it's free and because I live in the desert where any other color is going to get nuclear hot in a short time.  The paint on delivery was pretty much fine - no obvious defects other than a tiny spot on the hood where there was some contaminant under the paint.  But in just under 5k miles, the front bumper looks like absolute hell.  Chips galore, almost all down to the black plastic underneath.  The fremont paint is pretty worthless at standing up to the tiniest of rocks.  You can either accept that you'll need a repaint, or do PPF.  \n\nBasic Autopilot / Autosteer Beta - Utterly embarassing.  Coming from a Volvo with PA, the ADAS in the Tesla feels horribly implemented.  Phantom braking galore, freaks out when lanes widen, etc.  It's just not predictable, which is a must when you're designing a system of this type.  I really dislike that it automatically disables with even minor steering input - there's a pretty fine line between the amount of steering input required to let the system know you're there and the amount that immediately disables autosteer.  I don't think this is going to get much better down the road either, between the hardware that's missing and the fact they've already been working on it so long and are yet so far behind other manufacturers.  Not a huge deal for me, as I really only use it on long road trips, and it's not nearly as bad on the interstate as it is on highways.\n\nWheels - The uberturbines are kind of cool looking, but that's about it.  I'm going to get some 18s to replace them.  Looking forward to a smoother ride and better economy.\n\nSound - Cabin noise levels aren't terrible, but without a gas powered white noise generator directly in front of you, road noise is a lot more apparent. I put in the front wheel well insulation from RPMTesla and slapped some dynamat inside the front fender while I was at it and it made a huge difference.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nInterior - Wasn't sure how I'd feel about the single screen situation, but it has been pretty seamless.  The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the audio is great.  0 rattles or squeaks have manifested so far.\n\nPrice of ownership - Electricity is pretty cheap where I live (12.5 cents/kwh) so my costs to keep it running with at home level 2 have been minimal.  I've done 79% of my charging at home and only 21% at superchargers.  While my supercharging rate is nearly 4x more expensive (42 cents/kwh), it's not exactly breaking the bank to top off on road trips.\n\nPerformance - Hard to not smile when you floor it.  Braking could be improved, but coupled with max regen is perfectly adequate.  Steering feels precise and has good feedback.  Tiny gripe is that the turning circle feels pretty wide given the overall size of the car, but it isn't something I notice much.\n\nInfrastructure - Out west, supercharging makes ownership extremely easy.  0 range anxiety on any of my trips.  The only place I've looked into going where it might be a hassle is a long roadtrip to Yosemite from east of the park - there's just not a lot of options around there.  \n\nOverall I'm very happy with my purchase and think this vehicle is tough to beat as a daily commuter.  It's a strange package altogether to be sure - midrange price, miniscule cost to own, accelerates like a solid rocket, and farts on demand?  \n\nAnyway, longish post, hope this helps anyone considering a purchase.",

Having charging that was free was crucial to me because I wasn\u0019t looking to spend the same amount to charge as I would in gas. \n\nI commute to work at 4 AM, at this time the autopilot feature is the most efficient. With minimal cars in the road, I set the speed to 80 and cruise in the HOV. \n\n I ended up getting the 2024 AWD long range, due to the fact that I\u0019d be driving a lot of miles and didn\u0019t feel that the standard range would suffice. On the other hand I wanted AWD cause why not ball out. \n\nThe only issue that I would say is the down fall of this car is service. In my experiences the service messaging and over the phone communication has been poor. When I purchase the car I pulled away not checking everything out, this resulted in me not having a glove box the past month. I then looked for a service appointment (in August) and earliest availability was October 11. I ended up tinting all my windows and the windshield. I went 5% all around and 35% on the front since it\u0019s dark early in the mornings. Just my luck a rock chipped my windshield the same day. Tesla quotes $1700 for a windshield replacement. This is because it\u0019s not covered under warranty. I was able to get it filled under my insurance rather than pay for what Tesla quoted. \n\nIn all the car is in a lane of its own compared to others being developed in this age. \n\n",

      "text": "Hi everybody! As the title states, I was given the surprising news last week that I would be getting a Model 3, an exceedingly generous graduation gift that I absolutely did not expect and do not deserve. I had been planning on buying myself a Toyota Yaris next year, lol!\n\nAnyhow, delivery is expected in March! I chose the midnight silver metallic color, black interior, and aero wheels.\n\nMy questions for the community are:\n\n- I live in the Bay Area, but currently do not have access to a charger for overnight in my living space. Is this going to be a big issue?\n\n- What was the learning curve like for you switching to electric? I\u0019ve never driven anything but gas powered vehicles.\n\n- How difficult are the wheel caps accessories to put on? I\u0019d like to remove the aero covers but heard installation can be tricky. (EDIT: I am extremely embarrassed to find out how simple this was >!)\n\n- Is there anything you wish you knew before you\u0019d purchased your Model 3? I\u0019m all ears!\n\nAny info is appreciated, thank you! :)\n\nEDIT: Yes it was a college graduation, not high school, dear lord that would be even more obscene. Also, I\u0019m 28 years old so I\u0019m a more experienced driver than younger graduates, which I think played a tiny part in all this.\n\nEDIT 2: Wow! I\u0019m floored at how welcoming you have all been and the amazing tips and advice I\u0019ve been given, you went in to so much more detail than I ever expected and I\u0019m so grateful!\n\nI was a bit nervous posting here and including the fact that it was a gift for fear of being judged or written off as some spoiled brat, but figured it was important to add because otherwise I\u0019m sure people would have just asked why I didn\u0019t do more research before buying the car, haha! Anyhow, thanks again everyone!\n\nP.S. & As icing on the cake, my delivery was just bumped up to January-February, so I\u0019m stoked!",

      "text": "As the title says, I recently rented a Model 3 on Turo for use on a quick trip to visit family. Did quite a bit of driving both highway and city and night/day. Now it\u0019s ruined any joy I\u0019ve had for my daily driver. I\u0019ve been interested in Tesla vehicles for quite some time and until now I haven\u0019t been in the right financial area for owning one. With a possible promotion things are looking better. I took an opportunity after a work trip to rent the car and see how it handles, more so than the standard test drive.\n\nAfter picking up the car we immediately set off on I-70 west bound. It was late so there was very little traffic. Within an hour I was hooked. Cruise control was seamless as was autopilot (if a bit cowardly on both). The controls were intuitive and swapping from radios to my phone\u0019s music was a piece of cake. It was clear and the moon was near full so being able to see everything through the roof was amazing. \n\nAfter exiting the Eisenhower tunnels and making my way down, I was unsure of what to expect. With your usual vehicles, you\u0019d lower the gear and have to listen to that high RPM nonsense for a bit until you hit the bottom. Not the case here. With the cruise set the car maintained that speed and rolled down so quietly, not to mention the 20ish mile regen. Amazing.\n\nThe drive back was even better. With an additional passenger and both cargo spaces loaded, it still ran like a champ. My only complaint this time was with the cruise and autopilot mode dropping speed like it was nothing as soon as it sensed a car way ahead going even slightly slower. Otherwise it ran like a dream.\n\nThe best parts were the supercharging cost and the lack of road stiffness at the end. Gas in Colorado is around $3 so what I paid for the charge three times, was about 3/4 of what I would have paid for gas. One way. It\u0019s amazing. Plus after both trips across the western divide, I wasn\u0019t sore or uncomfortable. Those seats held me perfectly, tho I\u0019m sure that the supercharging break helped as well.\n\nCut to this week, driving to work has been.. quite honestly horrid. I\u0019m still reaching for the driving selector when I get in, despite only having the car for less than 48 hours. I miss the cruise feature and lane awareness as well as the live GPS screen view.\n\nHere\u0019s to hoping I\u0019ll have my own within the next few years. Big shout out to Pat who let me drive his baby.",

      "title": "3 year/50K Miles Review",
      "text": "Thought I would drop my thoughts after owning a Model 3 LR bought new, now owned for 3 years. First off, I am a car guy. I love shopping for cars, and am constantly looking into what's new on the market. I say that as a way of saying I am not a Tesla fan boy, but I definitely care about what I drive.\n\nTLDR; best car for the value ever made.\n\nThe Good: After all this time, I cannot get over the speed. My previous car was a V8 Camaro, so I was used to some energy in my driving, but this has not gotten tired yet. Simply put, I cannot imagine going back to gas. I love the sound and fury of a big ol engine, but speed wins over everything else for me. The completely smooth acceleration from zero cannot be beat. I also own an Ioniq 5, which has a nice drivetrain, but not as refined as the Tesla. \n\nI charge at home where my cost is $.13 per KWh, and despite my friskiness behind the wheel I get 260 Wh per mile, so the energy savings have been huge - about $8K over the 3 years. I have had no maintenance repairs. Tires were replaced at 34K, refilled my washer fluid several times, cabin air filter at the 3 year mark. Tires and filter were done by Tesla Mobile, which is a dream. But nothing repaired, nothing fixed. The layout of the interior is perfect for a driver, arm rest is comfortable, and the wireless charger is in perfect position. \n\nThe Bad: The car is not luxury. Of course, neither is the price, but regardless it is kinda loud on the interstate, and the seat is a little cheap feeling. I don't mind the clean, simple interior. There are a few rattles in the dashboard somewhere. Not enough to send me to the asylum, but not quite solid either - the Ioniq (also not a luxury model) wins the battle interior quality. Really, that's it.\n\nFew people come to the Internet to say \"All is well\" with whatever product. But for me, there is no other car for sale in the US that provides the combination of speed and value of the Model 3. None.",

But when I started looking at newer models after an unexpected engine failure, they were so similar in price to a Model 3, it didn\u0019t make financial sense to continue with the gas guzzler anymore. \n\nTest drove yesterday at 3 for the *first time*, returned to purchase at 1 the next day!! A few things that made this possible:\n\n1. Chose a degree program in the Midwest where I was paid well (yay STEM and cheap rent) but stayed a CA resident (yay rebates! - I\u0019m eligible for up to $5500)\n\n2. Diehard r/frugal lifestyle. No internet at home, no microwave (lol), alcohol is store bought, I make lunch everyday, etc. I was able to put 30% down and got a great loan rate of 2.89% for 48 months. \n\n3. Also a diehard of r/personalfinance. I\u0019ve been a student my whole life, and always lived below my means, or never went into cc debt or missed payments.

      "title": "Tesla Model 3 Winter Range - My Experience",
      "text": "A frequent question in this forum is about range in winter, so I wanted to share some of my data that I have accumulated over the past 4.5 years with my 2018 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD (pre-heat pump), living near Minneapolis, MN. It\u0019s not quite Canadian weather here, but I feel I can be a pretty good barometer for colder climates.\n\nFirst, a little background on the data I collect. I have been trying my hardest to take a picture of my odometer and clear my trip meter on the first of every month. I then enter the data into an Excel spreadsheet with some accompanying data like the average gas price, electricity cost, and temperature stats for that month. This gives me some good long-term stats and a great graph to back up my temperature related observations.\n\n[Graph from tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/whef6z9ytzma1.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de267d66d3ef4e63bff8c9a01fac9a428bee6bb9)\n\nLet me first dismiss the common misconception that in winter, \u001cyou can automatically expect a 30%-40% range loss.\u001d Sure, you can have a drive here or there where the range loss is bad, but when you look at the averages for an ***entire month***, you will see in my graph that the only times I ***ever*** got that low was during the 2019 POLAR VORTEX weather event. Let me remind everyone those two months it was abnormally cold where at one point the actual air temp got down to -27° F and stayed there for almost a week.\n\n[My tracking spreadsheet data](https://preview.redd.it/52ap5jyfuzma1.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95dd0f1a39b9307eb4356bc6e5b1e0aec6c2d61d)\n\nBack to the spreadsheet data, if you calculate the range loss from NOV through MAR for the last 5 winters combined, it averages to a -17.53% loss. (Not so bad considering the average internal combustion engine typically drops between [\\-15%-24% in the winter too](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/coldweather.shtml).)\n\nHere is another interesting observation from my spreadsheet. According to the EPA\u0019s web site, my Model 3 has a blended rating of 290 Wh/mi (29kWh/100 mi). Much to my surprise, the spreadsheet\u0019s calculations back that up with 290.03 Wh/mi over the life of my vehicle.\n\nDigging into the graph a bit more, each blue dot on the graph is the average monthly temperature versus the average watt hours per mi achieved during each month. You will see that I also added a green EPA rating line at 290, a blue 32° F freezing line, and a purple trendline for the blue dots. \n\nThe purple trendline crosses the EPA rating at right about 43° F. This means the when the average temp for the month is over 43° F, that I usually got ***better*** than the EPA rating. When the temp is under 43° F, my Wh/mi was typically in the 300-350 range, I assume because I only have the PTC resistance heater and no heat pump. What I have noticed anecdotally, is that when the temperature is between 65°-75° F, that is the sweet spot for efficiency. For August 2019, called out on the graph, I had a 17.24% ***gain*** in range with nice weather.\n\nIn conclusion, having 30%-40% loss during a ***single trip*** indeed happens, but that drastic of a loss for an ***entire month*** would likely only happen due to some unprecedented weather conditions (think Polar Vortex). \n\nWhen people ask about my range loss in the winter, I am quick to point out that my personal experience is \"actually pretty close to the winter gas mileage losses in my old Toyota Camry.\" Practically speaking, when doing road trips to ND to visit my in-laws in the winter, we usually have to sit at the supercharger for an extra few minutes, but it really isn\u0019t much of a bother.",

      "text": "I am asking for the honest opinion of those who are likely older, make more, and have purchased a M3 in recent times. \n\nI'm a 23 year old in my first engineering job out of college. I have a 2004 jeep wrangler that is my first car but has become a bit of a money pit ($4-5000 in repairs since May with another $1k I expect I would need to do in the next 3 months and 181k miles) but I could still get about 4-7k on craigslist for it in my area. I make about $80k in this job and have no debts from college thanks to some very generous grandparents and parents. Through co-ops and internships I managed to save about $10k through college with about 2k liquid, the rest mostly in IRA and other investments. I started this job in June and have been contributing heavily to retirement/ savings. My girlfriend and I live together and I've paid our rent of about 550 while she searched for a career but works in the meantime. She is days away from starting a job about $50k a year, gross. We have no significant debts and in my opinion will make very good money together and I have no doubts in my mind that we will get married. \n\nMy gf's mom owns the house we live in but we are responsible for the mortgage ie. renting rooms out to friends; this allows me decent freedom to get a 220v installed for home charging. \n\nSo basically, I think I will be buying a new (to me) car in the next year or two anyways, but I really want a Tesla and used cars are 20k+ for something decent. I rented a base M3 in August on a business trip and have been hooked ever since. I will likely buy used, as I don't need new and it's not worth the extra 7-8k looking at inventory in my area. I want a LR AWD preferably 2021 or newer for heat pump n such HW upgrades. Looks like I will land around 35-37k + tax + fees. \n\nAm I stupid? or will I appreciate driving a car I love and it will be worth the money.

      "title": "2021 SR+ First 500+ Mile Roadtrip",
      "text": "Just got back from my first decent road trip in my 2021 SR+ with NCA battery. The route was from Durham, NC (home) to Hendersonville, NC (parents house). I took [this route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Durham,+NC/Hendersonville,+NC/@35.6649521,-81.8314917,8z/am=t/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x89ace471120f66f1:0xe17ada898a46f27e!2m2!1d-78.898619!2d35.9940329!1m5!1m1!1s0x8859c2106af9b2bf:0x71613f7de9840a0!2m2!1d-82.4609528!2d35.3187279!3e0!5i1) which is the route I've taken for years with ICE cars.\n\n* Charging: I charged up to 100%(first time) before leaving my house, supercharged along the way 2 times. I didn't need to stop twice, but all of the superchargers along the way are at Sheetz gas stations which are pretty nice and have bathrooms, restaurants, and everything else you'd normally find at a gas station. Also I wanted to make sure I had plenty of power for going up the mountains in Western NC. I stopped at a supercharger once when I got to town to top off to 80%, then just used 110v at my parents house to top it up to 80% daily while visiting, then charged it up to 96% on 110v the day and night before I returned.\n* Drive quality - the drive was excellent. The sound system in the SR+ is better than any car I've ever owned (not saying much, coming from a 2009 honda civic so I'm used to some bad audio). I just listened to podcasts during the drive, but music would have been fine also. What really impressed me the most was autopilot. TACC was fine and performed better than the cruise control in my honda civic because of the distance keeping, but I mostly used the full autopilot with autosteering enabled. It made the drive 99% less stressful. I was a bit apprehensive due to all the complaints about phantom braking/slowdowns/disengagements that I've read on here and other Tesla forums, but it was a non-issue. I didn't have a single instance of phantom braking or autopilot disengaging on it's own and asking me to take over control - it just drove us pretty much the entire way. The route isn't easy either - this is from the Piedmont region of NC, through the foothills, and into the mountains along steep, windy/curvy mountain roads and passes. Autopilot was perfect - even through [this complex section](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Old+Fort,+NC/Black+Mountain,+NC/@35.6228454,-82.3209901,12z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8857551c6ea49143:0x7b126be0671999d0!2m2!1d-82.1806697!2d35.6290093!1m5!1m1!1s0x8859f9054a85b7a5:0x9e2ede5ac231d6d4!2m2!1d-82.3212302!2d35.6178951!3e0) with slow trucks and other cars around. The weather on the way there was clear and sunny, the leaves are off the trees here now so there were many sections of roadway with strobing sunlight through bare tree trunks, the cameras never had any issues. Weather on the way back was mostly cloudy, but no precipitation. I imagine if it was rainy, snowy, or foggy as it often is in the mountains of NC, then autopilot would probably have had some issues.\n\nThis experience was so satisfying and has convinced me that I made the absolute correct decision in buying this car. I've never bought a new car before this one, let alone a car this expensive, but this M3 SR+ is an overall awesome car and much, much better than I thought it would be.",

      "title": "What to expect at 100k miles",
      "text": "Hey guys. I just crossed over 100k miles! 2018 M3 LR AWD, 19\u001d wheels, acceleration boost. Here\u0019s some info you can expect.\n\nTL,DR: drive in chill mode, don\u0019t give Tesla service your business, road trips are good (even with base autopilot), expect the squeaks, enjoy the fuel savings\n\n1. Depreciation- my car was worth ~$55k when new in 2018, and it is now worth &lt;$20k, nearly 70% depreciation in 6 years\n\n2. Battery- I bought my M3 at 23k miles, and it reported 280 miles as max range. It now reports 267, which is 86% of its original EPA rating of 310\n\n3. Range- I have never gotten more than ~230 miles on a full battery when road tripping. Part of the reason is I don\u0019t need to go that far between charges, another reason is most of the time when road tripping, the weather was cold.\n\n4. Road trips- since my car is pre-heat pump, I genuinely estimate my wh/mi as 340. The car is EPA rated for 242 wh/mi, but due to the cold and the sport rims, when road tripping in the winter, I get that kind of efficiency. This means in the winter I can expect an 80% range estimate at about 150 miles.\n\n5. Charging- I\u0019ve lived in apartments close to free public chargers for the life of the car, so I have paid very little in charging costs. I estimate my effective charge rate as about $0.06/kwh (including supercharging) or about $1300 in 3 years and 77k miles. Do that in a gas car that gets 30mpg and it costs $7,000\n\n6. Charging (contd)- people are very inconsiderate at public chargers. I imagine this isn\u0019t an issue with a home charging setup, but often in apartment living, you battle self-entitled teslas and chevy volts that don\u0019t move their cars away from the free chargers for days at a time. This has forced me to go to super chargers in the past, costing me time and money\n\n7. Car washes- I\u0019ve only ever used touchless, manual spray washes on the car. As a result, I\u0019ve never gotten crazy scratches all through the paint, and I\u0019ve never had condensation in the lights. I clay and polish the paint once per year. When I detail the interior, everything looks brand new.\n\n8. Service- Tesla service is awful. I had my AC go out, which they estimated as a $400 repair. I asked if they could fix a squeak in my back left wheel (it squeaks loudly when I reverse while turning). They quotes me $600 for everything, and I decided to pay because the sound was annoying. They went in, without my permission, and replaced all 4 brake pads, and some calipers, and charged me $1900\u0013and the service was already completed, so I felt like I had no choice but to pay. Looking back, I\u0019ll never make that mistake again and I\u0019ll laugh in their face. They didn\u0019t even fix the issue, and I\u0019ve been dealing with it for the last 30k miles now. For the rest of my ownership, I will be performing my own repairs or finding a 3rd party to do them. Discount tire can handle alignments, tire rotations, and other wheel services, and squeaks and rattles are just a thing. Just get used to them, or else the service center will make things worse by trying to help.\n\n9. Drive- I come from rural Illinois, and when I was there, the AWD performance was excellent. In snow it was great, and going for a sporty drive with lots of 0-60s was so fun. Now I live in the city in Texas, and there are so many people on the road I can\u0019t gallop! Also, I keep the car in chill now 95% of the time\u0014even normal acceleration in standard/sport causes the tires to spin, and wears them down significantly faster. Base autopilot is great too, you don\u0019t need anything more.\n\n10. Insurance- Tesla insurance is very adaptable. I used to drive 25k miles in a year for work, my premium was $210/mo in TX with a 96 safety score. Now I drive &lt;9k miles per year since I work remote and only sometimes commute 40mi round trip to the office, now my premium is $122/mo with a 99 safety score. It\u0019s the lowest price insurance you can find\u0014if a bit annoying for dinging you for driving past 11pm at night.\n\n11. Accessories- I have 4 accessories with my car. \n-Jeda V4 wireless charger for legacy M3 (gives the original M3 the alcantara charger like the 2021+\n-USB A to USB C adapters for rear\n-A small plastic clip on the driver side visor to prevent it from buzzing and making noise\n-Alcantara center console tray to hold my sunglasses, J1772 adapter, and change\n\n12. Noise- I have one of the unfortunate early M3 owners flaws, which is the motor whine issue. Newer cars don\u0019t have this, I believe, but my front motor whines pretty loud when driving. I try to ignore it. Also, when driving on the highway, there\u0019s a whipping sound of the air hitting my driver side mirror- I took it in to service twice for them to fix this, and they did nothing both times. The car creaks when going over curbs and speed bumps. The reversing squeak comes back all the time (the one I had to pay $1900 for that Tesla didn\u0019t fix)\u0014the solution is to go to a manual car wash and blast water into the brake calipers and on the rotors real good. The sound goes away for about 4 weeks. A GOOD noise I hear is the sound system which is amazing.\n\n\nConclusion: If I needed a new car today, I\u0019d think twice about getting a tesla. For the cost of the monthly payment, I\u0019d honestly probably go with an older used Lexus instead\u0014purely because of public charger inconvenience, poor tesla service, and poor tesla quality control. Don\u0019t kid yourself and think Tesla has figured out their quality control\u0014see for yourself that they\u0019re still misaligning doors (ambient lighting issues), their steering wheels are creaking, and there\u0019s condensation under the lights. With an older ICE vehicle, at least you have control over your own service, and for the cost of a $500+ monthly tesla payment, it\u0019d be much easier to own an older car outright in this economy.\n\nI\u0019ll keep the Tesla until it dies. But it\u0019s just a car. And that\u0019s okay. Just lower your expectations.",

I love everything about it except for the part where having a Tesla can be considered a bit of a flex.\n\n40K isn't cheap, but you take a Ford F150, Subaru Outback or a Rav4 and you go up a couple trim levels and you're at a similar price (and don't forget gas and more maintenance). Pull up in one of those and nobody bats an eye, but pull up in a Tesla and everyone loses their minds. OK, not really.

      "title": "2023 Model 3 RWD w/ No Upgrades - 1 Month In - My Feelings",
      "text": "I've been noticing a number of folks on this sub who are on the fence about the purchase of a Tesla Model 3 RWD. I purchased and took delivery of mine 3-4 weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nTo start, I go the most basic version you can get. Pearl White with 18\" Aero Wheels and Black Partial-Premium interior. I'm coming from a 2009 Mercedes E Class so this is my first car purchase is over a decade. Even at the most basic version of the model, the cabin experience is amazing. Quiet, comfortable, and everything feels high quality.  You get 95% of the same features of a M3P but for a much lower price. From the Tesla app, to the charging experience, to the exterior look and feel, the car has exceeded my expectations in every facet.\n\nThis is also considered the \"slow\" model but you could've fooled me. My favorite thing about this car is the instant acceleration and smooth-as-glass ride. It is indeed like a small space ship.  And for the money, after rebates, is a major value. Prior to looking at a Model 3 I was testing out more conventional brands hybrids and they were all just MEH at best. Cut to my first test drive of a Model 3 RWD and I was instantly sold. And when you factor all of the federal and tax incentives you get with the Tesla over a conventional hybrid, it really is a no-brainer. \n\nI went from driving hardly at all, to looking for excuses to get in my car every day. With the home charger installed, I feel like I'm somehow cheating the system.  \n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for 19\" wheels? NO**. I love the fact that I can go Aero Covers or Mag wheels depending on my mood. I bought lug nut and center wheel caps to give a sportier look when off.\n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for a different color? NO.** I didn't realize the white finish is actually slightly pearlescent, not flat white. With the black trim and blank tint, it's downright slutty. \n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for the Long Range battery? NO.** I have the charger in my garage which gives me 272 miles of range which is far more than I'll ever need between my house an a Supercharger. The LFP battery in the RWD is also a bit of a bonus as I'm learning because of it's longevity and ability to charge to 100% consistently. \n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for the faster Performance version? NO.**  I'm already pushing the speed limit every time I get in it and having a blast. Anything faster and I'd probably get in trouble.\n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for a white interior? NO.** I have kids.\n\n**Do I regret** ***not*** **paying more for Advanced Autopilot or FSD? NO.** I will add these later when I feel the software is further along. \n\nTL;DR: Been driving a basic White 2023 M3 RWD and it's the coolest car I've ever owned.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the great feedback on this post. I just wanted to share my experience after 2 weeks with my M3. To address some commons questions:\n\n1. No, road noise/wind is not an issue for me. Maybe the dual pane glass is working better or maybe my previous car wasn\u0019t that quite, but it\u0019s not a problem.\n\n2. No, I am not a paid Tesla spokesperson but would welcome a job there any day!\n\n3. I charge at home using an L2 wall charger and usually top off from 85% - 90% to 100% daily which I\u0019m learning is not the best thing to do. The average cost in my area is $0.15 kWh. \n\n4. Glad to know the white interior is easy to keep clean. Next time I\u0019ll go white for sure. \n\n5. Biggest complaint so far is the heat that came from the roof on sunny days. Going to invest in sunshades to help reduce thermal gain. \n\n6. First world problem complaint: the Frunk closing mechanism is not great. You can\u0019t shut it hard but yet simply closing it will not fully latch the frunk so you need to push hard to get it to close correctly. \n\n7. Yes I realize my feelings may be different in 2 years or 5 years or in winter or whatever. I\u0019m just saying that my initial 2 weeks has been wonderful.\n\n8. OTD price before federal tax incentive and sales tax/title etc was $39,030. With tax incentive closer to $32.5K. Again, a major value and no gas required.",

      "title": "Thoughts on my new Model 3 from a Porsche enthusiast/owner",
      "text": "I began shopping recently to replace an older Cayenne which was my daily driver for quite a while, a fantastic vehicle that was surprisingly not that bad on gas for being a 400hp V8 (about 22mpg average). I still own a current gen Cayenne with all the handling upgrades (PDCC, PASM etc). I've had many dedicated sports cars over the years but currently do not have the luxury of keeping one around purely as a weekend car. \n\nCayennes really have everything you look for in a car, safety, fantastic handling and performance for a big vehicle and exceptional comfort for relaxed driving, plus reasonable economy for what they are.\n\nOriginally I hoped to pick up a GR Corolla as a somewhat economical performance/DD car, unobtanium. Golf R? Unobtanium at sticker, but a really great car, very Porsche-lite. So I expanded my search a bit, I drove the Acura Integra... garbage for the price. An Integra at 28k? Sure maybe, but at 40k? No way. As a primary daily driver, I wasn't looking for a manual, the CVT totally ruins any sporting characteristics of the Acura, the CVT is truly abhorrent.  Subaru WRX? ABSOLUTE shit box, 20ish MPG and it doesn't even handle well, also basically 40k, at least the Integra has a pretty nice interior, my old commuter 2010 Prius had a better interior than the brand new WRX.\n\nOn a whim, after seeing the 10k over sticker at the local VW dealership for the Golf R, I stopped in the Tesla place next door and took the Model 3 out. It was IMMEDIATELY clear this car is so far beyond anything in its price range its an absolute joke. \n\nSteering feel is huge for me personally, and right away I was shocked that it was... pretty damn good! Is it Porsche level? Not quite... but \"not quite Porsche level\" is an insane compliment for most cars. \n\nMy current Cayenne is tuned and fast as hell, its about 3.8 to 60mph. I ended up with a LR AWD which is technically a bit slower, but it doesn't really feel slower. Past 80-90mph? Sure the Cayenne really takes off vs the Model 3 but everyone knows Model 3s are quick, no need to go in depth about that. Concise version, not really a downgrade from a 500+HP twin turbo Porsche, albeit a porky one. \n\nHandling and brakes? The Model 3 LR AWD can't really compete with the total package of adjustable air suspension, Porsche's brilliant adaptive dampers, dynamic chassis control combined with 315 width Pilot Sport tires anchored by absolutely massive brakes. But for the price? Its ACTUALLY a drivers car. It blows away the WRX, Integra (non Type-S), BMWs in its price range etc. \n\nAt its price point you can get an used older last gen Cayman/Boxster/M car, a new Miata or GR86. Those are the only things that have a bit more drivers car cred than the Model 3. Yes, I am ignoring used Corvettes, Camaro 1LTE, Mustangs etc, I know they can be fantastic but... no.  \n\nI didn't touch on the Taycan but they are in a totally different price bracket, even high mileage used examples. The EV tech is behind the Model 3 for the most part, even ignoring charging network, total non-starter for me. I have no doubts a kitted out Taycan is better than the Model 3 but its basically double the price for a used example that MIGHT have the proper options to truly eclipse the Tesla. Pricing out a NEW Taycan that I would by any metric rather have is $120k. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.\n\nLong story short, the Model 3 absolutely shits on ANYTHING in its price bracket, ICE or electric. \n\nNow to the negatives... man... as soon as I clicked accept delivery of the Model 3 I was dropped like a hot potato. The delivery experience was horrible. In fact, it was non existent. The delivery lady pointed across the parking lot, pointed out a Camry and said its over there by that car, you can watch some videos in the car... and then literally almost ran away. I stood there for a bit dumbfounded. At the time of delivery I had spent maybe 20 minutes in a base model test driver car and had no idea how anything worked. \n\nI immediately found a massive gap between the window and B pillar, checked it in to service before even opening the doors after chasing down an employee. A few other doors are quite poorly aligned but I expected this and wasn't bothered. I did not know I had already accepted the car in the app... in my opinion I felt duped by the Tesla app into accepting the car. I should have been more careful. \n\nThe next day I actually drove the car home, the window B pillar gap looked better in the parking lot, I had no reason to expect that hadn't actually repaired the car. \n\nThey didn't repair the car. \n\nPerhaps they pulled the door molding out a bit so the gap wasn't immediately obvious, but definitely did not attempt to fix the issue, or fix and test drive to car to verify it was indeed fixed like the Tesla app stated. \n\nIn fact, they didn't even close out the work order days later so I couldn't make a new service request without a 45min long phone call trying to explain the issue and finally have someone click a button to fix the problem. As of right now, the issue still isn't resolved and the wind noise is unbearable without music playing. I have a mobile appointment upcoming in which I HOPE they will fix the issue. I figured out how to fix it own my own with some googling but I'm not breaking out the wrenchs just yet to fix a brand new car. \n\nAs of writing this, I still have gotten zero replies to any text messaged questions or concerns sent in the Tesla app since taking delivery and it took about 90 painful minutes on the phone to get a service appointment. \n\nTL;DR: Absolutely fantastic hardware and performance that is untouchable at its price point. Terrible experience so far post delivery. I knew what I was I was getting myself into with Tesla, great product, shit company, **the pros definitely outweigh the cons at its price point** but wow... a few tweaks and the ENTIRE experience could truly be next level. \n\nPostscript: I won't be getting rid of a Porsche anytime soon. When I have the freedom, I'll go back to a 911 or a Cayman from my Cayenne. Why? Because the driving enthusiast community experience is built into owning ANY Porsche, from a ratted out ancient 944,  6 year old base model Macan, to a brand new 911 GT3 RS, you can show up to events big and small without prejudice. I'm active in the PCA and nothing can replace a 400 mile day of canyon driving with a bunch of like minded individuals. I haven't searched in depth but haven't found anything like PCA events for Teslas, this is ignoring the fact that big canyon days behind the wheel aren't really as feasible with an EV at this point in time.\n\nAt the end of the day, any Porsche with the proper performance options from Cayenne to Cayman is a more satisfying drivers car, I doubt anyone but the biggest stans would argue that... but its shocking how close Tesla is with the Model 3 relative to its current price point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "Honest / critical Model 3 review coming from nicer German cars.",
      "text": "I've had my M3 LR for about 6 months now and have been driving it almost exclusively. I thought I'd write the review I wish I had read when I bought it.\n\nContext. The M3 is my first EV. I have mostly owned higher end German cars (manual BMWs, E46s and E88s) most of my adult life together with nice trucks. Recently had to replace my last BMW and given some work / life priorities I figured I'd go with something utilitarian. \n\nAfter 6 months (or even 6 hours honestly) of ownership, I discovered that most of the things you read in reviews or posts are probably coming from people with a different perspective than mine and that many of the things I personally was worried about where not at all major issues while others I didn't think about were. So here's a list of the good and the bad (no ugly). \n\nThe good.\n\n* Yeah, the car is fast. I know this is top in every review but it does put a grin on your face even if you're used to pushing an M5 around a track. This fact is actually pretty important in making an otherwise utilitarian tool enjoyable. \n* Home charging is genuinely nice. I could care less about the cost of gas, I'm used to filling up $100 / wk, but there's something really appealing about just leaving in the morning and not suddenly realizing that you forgot to fill up and rushing to work. I have 240V in my garage and the simple mobile charger and I can reliably get the charged up from zero overnight. If I get home after work with a low charge for some reason, I usually have enough after a few hours to go out. I can envision situations in which it would be limiting but after 6 months, I haven't encountered one.\n* 99% of the time the whole \"but will i have enough range for a road trip\" question is bullshit. I've done multiple road trips and while I live in the northeast and there's decent supercharger availability, it's really a non-issue. I suppose there are people who live in genuinely remote places, for whom this is going to be a real concern but it's probably not you.\n* Speaking of superchargers, again I honestly prefer this experience to filling up. Maybe I just hate gas stations. You park, plug in, and check emails for 15 min or go to the bathroom or grab a coffee. Again, maybe some people really need to drive 8 hours straight with minimal breaks and if that's a big deal for you, you won't like this. For most people though, it's a non issue.\n* Autopilot is nice and it's particularly nice that you can use it seemingly more liberally than in other vehicles with similar tech. I turn it on on arterial roads or even some larger neighborhood roads. It's nice not to think about traffic and unlike many rental cars I've had with lane keeping - it will steer sharply and it will go for a while without human input.\n* The touchscreen is also a non-issue. I thought I'd hate it but after day 1 you're kind of over the lack of gauges. Occasionally it's annoying to find something but for the most part it works. Having autopilot helps not have to fumble around in the UI while trying to steer.\n\nThe bad\n\n* If you're used to nice cars, this is not a nice car. Period. One thing I realized is that a lot of M3 users are coming from a Honda or Toyota and they are mind blown by the speed and even the fit and finish is an upgrade. If you're coming from anything German, it's going to be a notable downgrade. I'm not talking about the manufacturing issues per se - just the overall materials, level of comfort, etc.\n* Along the above lines, road noise is by far my biggest complaint. A decade of driving insulated German cars simply does not prepare one for the constant tire drone on the highway. It sucks bigly.\n* A lot has been written about fit and finish. I won't comment on this much because honestly I actually care less about panel gaps or occasional paint issues. You do however notice quality issues elsewhere. My TPMS sensor went out a few months into owning the car and I had to get it replaced.  The interior occupancy sensor is probably busted which results in the bluetooth not pairing automatically. The windows will occasionally not come back from the retracted state when you close the door. Occasionally the car will stay on after I leave. Stuff like this is pretty annoying.\n* Autopilot will occasionally try to kill you.\n* The LR supposedly has a vaunted speaker system. It's ... fine. All of my older cars had similar or better sound systems.\n* Tesla cheaped out in a number of places that really cause frustration. They skipped a $0.20 rain sensor in favor of using the cameras and the automatic wipers are garbage and either go off like crazy or keep going without stopping. They use cameras instead of radar for cruice control which is both scary and degrades with bad weather in a way that radar doesn't. It's actually wild that you may end up losing cruise control entirely in bad weather in a way that makes the car worse than a '99 accord.\n* They also cheaped out on a capacitive sensor for the steering wheel, so you have to actually yank it when autopilot complains about not having steering input. This is majorly annoying.\n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting something but this about it.",

      "title": "My experience with a Tesla from a car enthusiast and a long time Audi owner",
      "text": "TLDR and pictures of the cars for those who do not want to read this all:\n\nI know Tesla is not a luxury brand but gets close to hitting the mark.\n\n**Pros:** The car just makes sense. Great/better than expected driving experience, mind blowing torque, very comfortable, feature rich, incredible adaptive cruise control and quiet. Teslas are way over hated imo.\n\n**Cons:** Lack of leg bolsters, interior not as premium, not the most precise steering, no nice ICE sounds (though expected). Does lack a bit of 'soul' but the acceleration makes up for it.\n\nM3P pics: [https://imgur.com/a/ltwzWAm](https://imgur.com/a/ltwzWAm)\n\nAudi S3 pics: [https://imgur.com/a/mIYosAV](https://imgur.com/a/mIYosAV)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't seen many posts like this here so wanted to add my 2 cents as a former luxury car/ICE owner, car nut and lurker of this subreddit.\n\n**First I want to preface** by saying that as a car guy who was very against going electric, I am shocked by how amazing this car really is. Tesla, especially in the car community, gets way too much hate (although I was guilty of this too) and I think it comes down to the fact those people have never driven these cars before.\n\nI have owned two Audis for most of my driving life, my friends and family own luxury cars, and have been a car nerd my whole life. First I had an Audi A4 and then I upgraded (family member crashed it) to a 2019 Audi S3 that I eventually ended up stage 2 tuning.\n\nThis week I recently sold my Audi because Carvana was giving me an offer I could not refuse and maintenance/gas started to get out of control (the tune I had only let me us 93 octane). I was able to pick up a brand new existing inventory M3P for around $48,500.\n\n**Day of Delivery/Problems:** To start it was the easiest car buying experience I have ever dealt with as everything was done on the app. They must have improved panel gaps and QC problems because the only issue I have is that the wheels are slightly misaligned (car pulls a touch right), I already put a support ticket in and Tesla service is going to fix it for me for free. It's a bit of a hassle but nothing to cry over. After this experience of buying the car I dont understand why dealerships are still a thing.\n\n**Driving Experience:** This is one of the fastest cars I have ever driven off the line. My S3 would do around 0-60 in around 4.2 seconds which I thought was fast. I have friends that own R8's and M5's and this car is even more mind blowing off the line minus lack of sound. It does drop off in high speeds but the instant available torque is something I have never experienced. As a car guy I do miss the sound of an ICE but that is the tradeoff in getting an electric car so no surprises.\n\nHandling is also impressive. Even though my S3 was known for its semi poor handling, this car for its weight, just sticks to the ground at high speeds. It doesn't handle/track on the highway like expensive cars but it's not bad at all.\n\nBasic autopilot without a doubt is the best ACC I have ever used on the highway. Family member got a 2023 Cayenne coupe with \"self highway driving\" and it doesn't even compare to the Tesla. It's actually wild how far ahead Tesla is in this regard.\n\n**Interior:** I got the white interior and actually dont mind how minimal it is. Most cars are going the all screen route anyways although some physical buttons (like for the climate control would be nice). Even with no dashboard in front of me it took me like 5 minutes to get used to. Personally I do not think it takes more time looking to the right than looking down in front of you like in a traditional car so this doesn't bother me.\n\nIt is crazy that the car has more standard features/gimmicks than even $100k+ cars. But, I can tell it's not as premium as Audi. Tesla uses cheaper plastics, thinner leather, and no metal for their interiors but still a pretty impressive interior compared to similar cars in that price range.\n\n**Comfort:** The seats are some of the most comfortable seats I have been in and actually have better bolstering than my old Audi sport seat package. **Cons:** The only issue about the seats is I wish the car had leg bolsters and an adjustable headrest but I am a much taller guy.\n\nDisclaimer, I'm a pretty skewed statistic and can't speak for everyone because I am used to sport suspensions but it I think its pretty well tuned in delivering a comfort/sporty suspension. I can see how for most people it might be a too rough but for me it's fine. I do wish you were able to switch the suspension settings though.\n\nTo explain the car perfectly: It just makes sense.  I am a happy new Tesla owner and still shocked that I made the switch to electric. Yes there are some things to be critical about but for the price it's better than anything on the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "I kept track of all my Model 3 costs. Here's the breakdown of all costs for those interested.",
      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI bought my Tesla Model 3 two years ago in Toronto. Since then, I\u0019ve kept track of every dollar I\u0019ve spent on it. Here\u0019s what I\u0019ve spent on the car after 50,000km of driving. I hope this can help anyone who might be on the fence or wondering about how much it costs to drive a Model 3 in Canada.\n\n[I also made a video if that makes it easier to follow.](https://youtu.be/DcMV0wqtitw) \n\n## Cost of the Car\n\nI picked up my car on June 5th, 2018. At that time, there wasn\u0019t much flexibility when it came to options. I could only choose the long-range rear wheel drive option.\n\nHere\u0019s the breakdown of the cost.\n\nBase price of the car was $45,600.00\n\nLong range battery upgrade was $11,900.00\n\nPremium upgrade was $6,600.00\n\nIn terms of options, I went with the Midnight Silver Metallic colour, which cost me $1300 and I purchased Tesla\u0019s enhanced autopilot package for $6600, which included things like summon, lane changes, and lane keeping.\n\nAfter taxes, the car cost me $83,169.35.\n\nBecause I got my car before the provincial election in Ontario, I was able to qualify for the EV rebate, which at the time was $14000 in Ontario. I received that about 6 months after purchasing my car. That brought the total cost of the car down to $69,169.35.\n\nInsurance is kind of high where I live. I used to pay $192/month for the first couple years and a few months ago, my premium went up to $265/month because of a speeding ticket and more claims in my area. Overall, I\u0019ve spent $5,668.00 on insurance so far.\n\n## Charging Costs\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0019ve driven my car almost 50,000km. Most of the mileage comes from my daily commute to work, but I also took quite a bit of road trips.\n\nOver the past two years, I\u0019ve taken 3 trips to NYC from Toronto, 1 to upstate New York, 1 to Montreal, and 1 trip to Saskatoon. In total, I\u0019ve covered about 15000 kilometres on the supercharger network. Tesla bills by the minute and your rate per minute depends on the speed of charging. In total, I spent $407.78 on supercharging across all my trips.\n\nLike most Tesla owners, I charge my car at home. In Ontario, we get a lower electricity rate during off peak hours, so I\u0019ve set my car to only charge during off-peak hours. In total, I\u0019ve spent approximately $593 on home charging.\n\nSo, the total cost of charging for driving almost 50,000 kilometres is about $1001.38.\n\nIn comparison, if I drove a BMW 3 series for the same distance, I\u0019d spend approximately $6000 on gas.\n\n## Repair and Maintenance\n\nIn terms of repairs and maintenance, there hasn\u0019t been much.\n\nI got unlucky during my first month of ownership and cracked my windshield twice while driving on the highway to work. The first time, it was only a chip, which I got fixed for $100 at Speedy Glass. The second time, I got a big crack, so I had to replace my windshield. That cost me a $500 insurance premium.\n\nBecause I live in Canada and we get a decent amount of snow up here, I decided to get winter tires. I opted for the Michelin X-Ice Xi3 Tires, which cost me $1,178.77. I\u0019ve been going to KalTire for seasonal tire replacement, which costs $137 each time as I didn\u0019t buy separate rims for the winter tires. In total, I\u0019ve spent $551.44 on tires changes in 4 seasons.\n\n## Mods and Accessories\n\nI hadn\u0019t made many changes to my Tesla Model 3. I had the car tinted when I got it for $250 dollars. This included the side windows and partial rear window. At the time, most of the shops in my area couldn\u0019t do the full rear window and the ones who could were charging 3 times the price of partial. I got used to the partial window pretty fast.\n\nApart from that, I partially wrapped the front of the car with clear wrap. That cost $650. I should\u0019ve got the entire front wrapped, so if I were to get a new car today, I\u0019d wrap the entire front of the car.\n\nBecause of the wet winters here, I decided to get all season floor mats. I opted for the 3dMaxpider mats after doing a bit of research and the mats cost me $210.17.\n\n## Total Cost\n\nSo, the total cost of the car after the provincial rebate comes to $79,279.11 after 2 years and 4 months of ownership and 50,000km of driving.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you found this helpful, please [consider subscribing here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrP4jrEMokSG_iR6u5C7XTA).

      "text": "I'm in Louisiana and was just hit by a major hurricane and was out of power for about 70 hours.  While my city was spared with avoiding serious damage, being out of electricity in the summer heat here is dangerous.  Heat index the past few days was at 100 degrees, and my house's temperature was in the mid 80s at night.\n\nHaving a Tesla was a HUGE benefit.  I charged the battery to 90% before the storm and slept in the car for 2 nights in camp mode.  In the worst of the heat, when my fans running around the house on generator power wasnt enough to keep cool I put me and my 3 dogs in the car and cooled off watching netflix for a bit.  Talk about handy when you spend 3 days just covered in sweat.\n\nOther major bonus - the Tesla supercharger was available so I could charge my car with just a little wait time.  Right now, gasoline is VERY hard to come by and people search for operating gas stations and wait for hours hoping they can find some for their vehicles and to keep powering their generators.  I was able to charge up to full, drive an hour away from areas hit by the hurricane and fill up a couple more gas cans to deliver to people in need.  \n\nIf anyone is near Ida's path and is looking to help, these folks need gasoline the most. Neighbors are sharing gas and generators where possible, but the scarcity of gas is really crazy right now. Water, food and other supplies are also good.",

      "title": "Model 3 LFP Review after 60k miles",
      "text": "Hopefully this post will provide some info/context to anyone considering purchasing an LFP Model 3. I\u0019ll keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI took delivery of my LFP Model 3 on February 21, 2022. I drive a LOT for work, and I chose the Model 3 for the potential gas savings and autopilot. I\u0019ll share my actual savings below as well as degradation and repairs.\n\n**Battery Degradation:**\n\nAs of today, I\u0019ve driven just over 60k miles. I\u0019ve experienced roughly 4% degradation in this time. Brand new, the car showed 272 miles of range. It now shows 261. This has not impacted my daily driving in any way. I charge to 100% every day. Electricity is a flat $0.09/KwH in my area. I live in the south, so winters are moderate.\n\n**Range Anxiety:**\n\nI would comfortably trust this car for \\~190 miles on the highway at highway speeds (80mph) during the summer. During the winter, 140-150 miles. Far less than the advertised range. For me, I don\u0019t mind stopping every 2.5-3 hours to charge. I would normally stop for bathroom breaks and to stretch my legs, so this isn\u0019t a huge deal to me. That being said, if money were no object, I would go with the long range. More for the charging speeds than range. This car is limited to 170KW supercharging, while long range models can charge at 250KW. Faster charging would be nice.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nRepairs are minimal with this car, but I\u0019ve had a few.\n\n1: The most significant issue was a drive unit failure. The car just suddenly failed on me during a road trip - I couldn\u0019t drive the car at all. Thankfully this occurred while parked. I had to get the car towed to the nearest service center (90 miles away). Took Tesla about 3 weeks to fix. They paid for the repair and my rental car during this process. No issues since.\n\n2: I\u0019ve had the seal repaired on both front windows three separate times. I was experiencing significant wind noise, and replacing the window seals has yet to fix the issue completely; it\u0019s \\~ 80% better, but I suspect the front windows are misaligned on the track within the door, causing an imperfect seal when fully rolled up, thus causing wind noise at high speeds. Not an issue for city driving. I\u0019ve decided it\u0019s no longer worth trying to fix and I just deal with it.\n\n3: I\u0019ve replaced tires once in 60k miles, costing roughly $1600. I didn\u0019t rotate tires properly during this period causing my back tires to wear rapidly. Tesla recommends rotating tires every 6000 miles or so.\n\n4: I had the back glass replaced due to a rock cracking it. \\~$800 repair.\n\n5: not technically a repair, but it cost me $1300 to have an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet at my house. My mobile connector was included with the car at the time of purchase, but Tesla no longer includes these for free. This will add \\~$250 to your charging installation cost.\n\nNow onto savings. My previous vehicle was a 2014 Ford Fusion Energi (plug in hybrid) which got around 40mpg when running in hybrid mode. Over the last year according to the Tesla app, based on gas prices in my area and my previous car\u0019s MPG, I\u0019ve saved around $2200. Not quite the savings I was looking for, but if you\u0019re switching from a less fuel efficient vehicle your savings would be better. Gas is roughly $3.20 in my area as of Sept 18th 2023.\n\n**Things to consider when purchasing:**\n\nI live in a small town, and none of my local tire shops will accept any Teslas for tire rotations. The nearest Tesla service center is two hours away. This won\u0019t be an issue for me 99% of the time, but for any repairs larger than a tire rotation, I would have to drive two hours to have my car worked on. Thankfully, Tesla mobile service alleviates most issues. I can have my tires rotated for around $70 with mobile service. (Yes I will be doing this myself in the future, I\u0019ve since purchased the required tools)\n\nTLDR; After 60k miles, I\u0019ve experienced 4% degradation in my Model 3 LFP. 272mi -&gt; 261mi. I charge to 100% every day. I\u0019ve experienced range anxiety one time in 60k miles, but I drive an abnormal amount. Repairs have been minimal. Best car I\u0019ve ever owned, but if I could do it again I\u0019d get the long range for faster charging speeds.",

      "text": "When I first took delivery of the car over a year ago, the low speed autopilot handling was a dream for freeway traffic jams. I could click it on and relax until traffic cleared up, with the car gracefully creeping, accelerating, and decelerating as required. But as of a few months ago, after a software update, it drives likes an overzealous student with one foot on the gas and one on the brake. The car will aggressively accelerate as soon as the vehicle in front starts to creep, and then slam on the brakes once it realizes things aren't going faster, repeatedly. It makes the experience wholly unpleasant and I find myself having to switch off autopilot under low speeds, the single place it was most helpful before. Have other M3 drivers experienced this, or is it just me? Has anyone found a way to smooth the ride out?",

      "text": "I never write blogs or long posts but I just went on an amazing trip with my M3 LR RWD and wanted to share. I bought this car 2 years ago and due to work travel and COVID I only have 13K miles on the odometer.\n\nAn opportunity arose due to my friend getting married in Colorado and I\u0019ve never been to any of the national parks in the desert south west so I decided to make a rod trip out of it!\n\nI drove from the LA area to Bryce Canyon and stayed a few days, then to Moab UT for a night, then to Durango CO for 3 nights then home through New Mexico &amp; Arizona. Story and Pics follow.\n\nI left around 8am and drove to Bryce. It's a 530 mile trip and took \\~9 hours. I roughly mapped out the trip via ABRP with conservative settings to get an idea of the trip and made sure to stay at hotels that had destination chargers. My first and most range anxiety stop was at Primm, NV. The car said from the start I'd arrive at 7%. If you\u0019ve done this drive from LA after Baker there is a large uphill incline followed by a long decline to state line. Going up the hill I had less range than the distance to destination. My wife was super nervous as was I. I drafted behind a semi which BTW I'm not even sure I did properly as I don\u0019t know how to actually draft LOL. Anyway coming down the hill I regen\u0019ed almost the entire way and arrive with 6% and 19m range. I should have just realized and trusted the car from the beginning.\n\nThis was a pic during the moments of stress\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/lm6SMgG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lm6SMgG.jpg)\n\nSo hot&so many fires along the way \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/n8OlGTH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/n8OlGTH.jpg)\n\nMe charging in Primm, NV at 118 ambient. 130+ Kw\n\n[https://imgur.com/0oWgO2J.jpg](https://imgur.com/0oWgO2J.jpg)\n\nWe had lunch in the casino and headed on to St George UT.

We stopped for only 5 mins since there was nothing around, but it never mattered since we arrived at St George with \\~105 of range\n\n[https://imgur.com/1iE65bn.jpg](https://imgur.com/1iE65bn.jpg)\n\nSt George, UT was a challenge. It was so hot that day the heading across the NV desert my car registered in at 119F.\n\n[https://imgur.com/2Ppo7o4.jpg](https://imgur.com/2Ppo7o4.jpg)\n\nWhen I arrived in St George I had 104 miles and there was a line at the charger. I had to wait 15 mins then realized why there was a line. The car told me to charge for 20 mins but it took over an hour with \\~30Kw max charge speed. It wasn\u0019t just me as other cars were there a long as me and the line grew. I guess it was the heat...it was blazing hot although I charged in Primm at 118F and had no problems.\n\nThis was the only \u0018annoyance\u0019 in charging but we made the best of it and I made it to Bryce which is a large elevation gain with 29% SOC...i guess I waited too long in the St George heat and that slow 30Kw =\n\n\nWe stayed at the Bryce Canyon Best Western. They had 4 chargers. No problems although one of them requires you to park in a no parking spot to make the cable reach. Bryce is \\~8-9K feet so the temp was cooler. Still hot with highs in the 90s. I\u0019ve didn\u0019t know that any state had an 80mph speed limit but Utah does!\n\n[https://imgur.com/80kIrn2.jpg](https://imgur.com/80kIrn2.jpg)\n\nThis is the part where we deviate from the car a bit. Stayed 3 days. Hiked and road horses. Amazing place...breath taking\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZZpClbt.jpg](https://imgur.com/ZZpClbt.jpg) \n\n[https://imgur.com/TGM6CzI.jpg](https://imgur.com/TGM6CzI.jpg) \n\n[https://imgur.com/a5bAOVA.jpg](https://imgur.com/a5bAOVA.jpg) \n\n[https://imgur.com/oXgFycB.jpg](https://imgur.com/oXgFycB.jpg)\n\nFrom Bryce we headed to Moab and stopped at Green River which was a great charging station with a very good local restaurant across the street.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/q9cICow.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/q9cICow.jpg)\n\nMoab was very hot \\~110F, but Arches national park was as expected. I figured I\u0019d be able to drive through get out for a few mins, take it in, and get back into the car. I was able to do that. Camp Mode was awesome for this =\n Yeah yeah I know there are hikes and things I could have done but I wouldn\u0019t be in this trip if it weren\u0019t for the wedding so the time of year and temps were just part of the coincidence of me even having driven here in the first place.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KHyxV4p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KHyxV4p.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3h2Vg4v.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3h2Vg4v.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/f3uaBYh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f3uaBYh.jpg)\n\nIn Moab we went to a winery after an amazing drive along the Colorado river. I knew Utah had strict laws on drinking but man this was a let down if you like to relax and have a drink. I knew something was up with the tasting was $1 per person. The drive was amazing though and that\u0019s what matters\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ZuQaPDc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZuQaPDc.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Qqhso3T.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/yX6GlSD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yX6GlSD.jpg)\n\nFinally, the wedding! I wish we had more time on Moab but alas we woke up and headed to Durango. In Durango our hotel had 4 destination chargers and no problems finding an open spot. We stayed at the Double Tree which was a amazing hotel on the local river.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/010ACw8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/010ACw8.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/5e2mbZc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5e2mbZc.jpg)\n\nDowntown Durango was very cool. Lots of small locals shops and a great Winery named Four Leaves\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/QDBTCGX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QDBTCGX.jpg)\n\nThis is an Aerial shot of the historic narrow gauge train depot\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/aPMQjQZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aPMQjQZ.jpg)\n\nDurango was beautiful and we took this awesome historic train ride from Durango to Silverton. This ride is 9 hours pre-COVID but only 3 now due to 50% capacity and the financial ability of the entire run. It was still amazing.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ric0c8o.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ric0c8o.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ik4KhcT.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ik4KhcT.jpg)\n\nOh and we couriered the bride\u0019s vale all the way to the wedding! \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/BWCedu1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BWCedu1.jpg)\n\nAfter 3 days in Durango having a great time with friends, we headed home through New Mexico and Arizona. Coming into New Mexico from Colorado put us in the Navajo Indian Reservation. Talk about a depressing place. The landscape was ugly, the roads were bad, and there were \u001cdon't drink and drive signs\u001d all over the place including the do not enter signs all over the media separated highway which suggests a lot of people go flying down a divided highway the wrong way.\n\nWe stopped to charge in Gallup, NM which is a skip. There is nothing in walking distance at all. That said charging was fast! \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/YMrJjet.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YMrJjet.jpg)\n\nWe also stopped at Holbrook, AZ. We didn\u0019t need to charge but were hungry an there is a Burger King there. Now off to Flagstaff where we spent a night and hit local bars which was fun as it\u0019s a college town. We charged at the super charger which is in the hotel parking lot we stayed in and then woke up to head home the next day.\n\nOn the way home we stopped in Needles, CA just past the border. I suppose I forgot to take a pic because I can\u0019t find one but it\u0019s a good spot at a Dairy Queen which fortunately in this blazing hot place has partial shade on the chargers depending on on time of today you go. I was there about 9:30am\n\nFrom there we headed to Barstow which requires a solid charge as the elevation gain is \\~4K feet and it\u0019s one of the most desolate drives I\u0019ve ever done. There is absolutely nothing out in the Mojave desert except blazing heat and sand. Running out of charge or breaking down out here would suck. It was \\~150 miles and I used 250 miles of range to achieve it but I arrived with plenty.\n\nCharging in Barstow was nice. They have 12 stations and shade. There are several places to eat in a short walking distance.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/JNmsVmM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JNmsVmM.jpg)\n\nFrom there I was home in 90 mins!\n\nThis was a great trip and while my wife didn\u0019t really understand why i didn't want to fly for me in addition to seeing these amazing national parks I wanted to see what it was like to drive an EV thousands of miles and frankly as I mentioned at the beginning I\u0019ve had this car 2 years with only 13K miles and I wanted to road trip away from this COVID isolation. The trip was amazing, the car is amazing. A few closing thoughts\n\n1 - Charging is not slower than pumping gas. Yeah filling the tank takes 5 mins, and charging takes 15-30 mins but depending on the situation but after driving for hundreds of miles for multiple hours getting out to get a drink, stretch, grab a bite to eat is what I would have naturally done anyway and the time at the stop felt totally normal.\n\n2 - The issue in St George was an anomaly IMO. It was almost 120 degrees ambient and the charger was busy.\n\n3 - The trip was super smooth and EAP relieves a lot of driving fatigue. I don\u0019t know how to explain it but using EAP makes you far less fatigued than normal driving. I was able to stretch my legs, enjoy some scenery, and overall feel more after each leg of the trip.\n\n4 - Lastly&..it\u0019s amazing to me that we have technology that can hurl me across the desert in 100+ temps at 85mpg for hundreds of miles in luxury all using a battery!! I hope you all enjoyed reading this. I enjoyed writing it.",

At this moment in time I rent and don\u0019t have a way to charge at my complex, so I\u0019d be 100% reliant on a supercharger station a few blocks down the road. I WFH and don\u0019t drive all that much, maybe 50-75 miles a week. I did the math and even supercharging at the highest price at that station (42 cents per kWh) would cost me a little less than what I currently spend on gas yearly. My guess is that I\u0019d only have to supercharge 1-2 times per week for 30 min intervals. Since I WFH I could do this whenever to avoid lines. Is this a dumb idea? Thoughts?",

      "text": "Purchasing our Model 3 has been an utter NIGHTMARE \n\n2 weeks ago I contacted tesla looking for a slightly used Model 3 around the $30,000 price range. I was contacted back quickly and told they had one that they really thought we'd like. 2020 Long Range AWD less than 30k miles and even came with the enhanced Auto Pilot (summon etc) &amp; the accelerator boost? I'm new but it had some type of feature similar to that.\n\nAll for 32,500. Not bad right? We could've gotten a similar one cheaper but we were advised that it's a must to go thru tesla to ensure warranty has been kept up with. Essentially being told if we purchase a used one and it's not from them that they can't guarantee any warranty would be good. \n\nNow before I go further, I'm an OTR truck driver and planned on purchasing a tesla on April 6th when I'm back home so me and my fiance could go and pick it up.\n\nBeyond excited we saw this car was located in GA. We live in SC! Not bad, right? Est delivery for a vehicle that showed was in GA was approx 1 week, we figured that'd be perfect! We're new so we were unaware and hadn't been told by our advisor that they actually had the vehicle at their lot.  We were even advised via email that because online showed one week est ready that we were good to submit deposit and complete financing. \n\nUnfortunately as soon as we ordered the vehicle the next day we were told that it was ready and HAD to be picked up in 72 hours. \n\nIn a panic situation I referred back to the emails being told it was OK to place deposit and that if online shows one week it would be perfect timing for us to pick up vehicle. Unfortunately this was not the case anymore and I was told that we would have until Sunday March 31st to pick up the vehicle or we would lose it &amp; that they would petition to get our deposit back but there's no guarantee as usually THERES NO EXCEPTIONS on refunding deposits. \n\nThis is still the car we dreamed of and I've worked years on my credit to have a great score! There's no way I want anyone else to run another hard inquiry on our credit, so I must figure out a way to be back home literally IMMEDIATELY. \n\nI rush and find a load home that gets me to our house in South Carolina on Friday morning. Tesla is aware that we will be there Friday evening or Saturday to pick up the vehicle as we've already paid down payment and taken care of everything including full coverage insurance on vehicle. \n\nFriday morning we rush to Tesla in GA which takes us approx 6 hours. We book expensive hotel (Spring Break is going on apparently) About an hour out from GA we receive a phone call and are told by our advisor that they are extremely sorry but they aren't able to allow us to take delivery of vehicle. No exceptions. Delivery of vehicle must be taken in North Carolina. \n\nNow mind you, since Tuesday (it's friday) I've rushed every minute and lost thousands to ensure that I would only go in the direction of home taking a very cheap rate because i HAD to be there or I would lose out on it all. \n\nThis dealer apparently is only a new vehicle dealer and is a manufacturer. Our advisor was unaware until this moment that South Carolina law prohibits us getting vehicle directly from Manufacturer. \n\nCompletely baffled and distraught on the phone we were told that Tesla would cover the complete cost of hotel, shipping charges of vehicle ($500) &amp; the cost of gas for a 12 hour round trip. \n\nWe arrived Saturday morning and are now being told that the vehicle (which is only 4 hours away from NC dealer) won't be there until possibly Wednesday \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what to do? Any similar situations? I feel as if Tesla should be doing more at this point. Now we are looking at the original appt time that we were told was OK to begin with and then told that they couldn't under any circumstances\n\nWe just feel even though we absolutely love Tesla this has been a complete nightmare \n\nHere's a picture of the car that we got to finally see.

      "title": "Thoughts from a new Tesla M3P owner after nearly a week...",
      "text": "I lurked on this sub a while before ordering and taking delivery so thought it might be helpful to others to share some brief thoughts. This is my first Tesla and I was a bit apprehensive going in about making the change to EV.  Now that I've been driving for almost a week I can easily say this is my favorite car I've ever owned or driven. This car feels so good to drive, it handles great, looks great, is very comfortable and just extremely fun to drive. The tech is really cool and the acceleration is EVERYTHING!\n\nIt didn't take long to get used to the touch screen controls. Probably the hardest thing to adjust to is changing from Drive to Reverse and park but after a few days it became second nature. The lack of stalks does not bother me a bit, I actually really like the simplicity and minimalism of it. I think the capacitive turn signal buttons are very easy to use and responsive. I had seen some complaints of this but I haven't had any issues so not sure if there was an update recently to improve these.  After a few days of driving the Tesla I drove our ICE vehicle and got tripped up a few times when using turn signals and shifting lol.\n\nKeeping it charged has not been as stressful as I imagined. It just takes some getting used to and is a mindset change. Of course, having a home charger really makes this a non issue but there isn't a lot of super chargers nearby in my area so it does take a bit of planning on my part if I'm going to be out and about for some time.\n\nAs with any new car I've owned, I'm very peculiar about it getting scratched or dinged or just some degenerate intentionally hitting it. I live in a rural area and there is a lot of unreasonable hatred for these types of cars. I haven't encountered anything yet but I know its coming. My previous car was a '23 Honda Civic and I used to catch grief and get ran off the road from overcompensating big truck drivers even in that. At least with this car I know I can be out of their sight in seconds lol.\n\nIt took almost 4 months to take delivery but it was very much worth the wait. I was tempted to cancel the order several times after repeatedly being pushed back but I'm glad I didn't. I did have one issue with one of the rear tail lights containing excessive condensation and water which I posted previously about, however Tesla service is supposed to be making a home appt to fix this week. I'll report on that experience later!\n\nThe only real downside I can think of owning this car is that its going to eat through tires. With the savings on gas this shouldn't be a big concern but I'm definitely going to be investing in a set of all season tires and possibly some different wheels for the cold season. If anyone has any recommendations for the '24 M3P I'd appreciate it! If anyone is on the fence or has an order and has any questions, feel free to ask!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4dh7uwdy9id1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f95a75f78e6d20e5d53f39cc599c6781f406b98\n\n",

If i'm an idiot, then there are other idiots out there as well who needs to call their electric company, cause you never know! \n\nI've had my awesome M3 for 18 months now, my electric company was charging at $0.13 cents / kWh flat rate (USD). To me? awesome, sure, much cheaper than gas, didn't care what these numbers meant. \n\nI was talking to my cousin and he said his electric company has no charge at off peak hours (midnight to 6am) and I couldn't believe that in 2024 there is \"free electricity\". Low and behold, I called my electric company and they have a EV plan where super off peak hours are from 11pm to 6am charging only $0.026 cents / kWh!

      "title": "A short review",
      "text": " For those curious about the new model 3, here\u0019s a quick review. We picked up our Model 3 on October 25th here in the Netherlands and have driven it a little under 2000 km since then. First road trip is done too. Disclaimer: part of this review is also a recycled comment I posted last week.\n\nLet me start off by saying that this is our first EV. I\u0019ve driven a Model 3 a few times but can\u0019t say I know the pre-refresh model particularly well, so I can\u0019t really compare it to the old car very well, aside from the fact that there is a noticeable increase in ride comfort and quietness.\n\nA little background to our purchase:\n\nFor sometime, I\u0019ve been looking for a new (old) car. Unfortunately the used car market in the Netherlands (and Germany, where I looked as well) isn\u0019t exactly a buyer\u0019s market at the moment. Sellers demand outrageous prices for worn-out and used-up shitboxes. I have a strong preference for older cars so I was looking at older E-Class Mercedes-Benzes and Volvo 960s and the like. To give you an idea of what I like, I have a 1989 Mercedes 190E that I\u0019ve owned for nearly 15 years almost right after I got my license and likely will never get rid of. It\u0019s not a daily driver anymore and spends the winter months in storage. I was getting frustrated with the used car market and gave up looking at some point because I don\u0019t necessarily need a car. \n\nThen my partner also needed a new car. His 2002 Volvo S80 is nearing 350k km. It\u0019s solid and reliable car but it\u0019s getting up there in age and is becoming maintenance-intensive for the 30-40k annual kilometers he drives. Since we both needed/wanted a new car, and given his driving needs, an EV seemed sensible. The Volvo is staying as a spare car - despite the good condition it\u0019s in, it\u0019s practically worthless at this point so we figured we may as well keep it.\n\nHow did we end up with the Tesla? Well, if it were up to me and practically and maintenance costs weren\u0019t an issue, we would\u0019ve gone for another ancient Benz or Volvo. But we were looking for a car that can serve as a reliable and not-too-expensive daily driver. For us, it offers by far and away the best value for money of quite honestly any car on the market. ICE cars in the Netherlands are taxed to high heaven so even something as \u001cbasic\u001d as a BMW 1-series or Mercedes A-Class is significantly more expensive when equipped similarly to the Tesla. Add to that that I just don\u0019t like the styling of most modern German cars anymore (too ostentatious and in the case of BMWs a bit tacky too) and those fell off the list. Plus a liter of gas has been hovering at or over 2 euros (or about $8/gallon) for some time now and it doesn\u0019t look like it\u0019ll be getting any cheaper anytime soon. Other EVs also weren\u0019t that attractive, except that lovely new Volvo EX30 but unfortunately it had a 9-month waitlist so that wasn\u0019t really an option. The Korean brands had good offers, but the Tesla was clearly the winner when it comes to value.\n\nSo after this super long background story: what do I like and dislike about the Tesla? What I like: \n\nA serene ride. It\u0019s a very pleasant car to drive around town, and even more so on long distances. It has a super comfortable and quiet interior. I am also very impressed with the finish of the cabin. Even at higher speeds (&gt;130 km/h), there is barely any wind rush and the double-pane glass makes for a very, very hushed cabin. Soft and high-grade materials line every surface of the interior. The seats are comfortable(nearly as comfortable as the ones in our old Volvo) and there isn\u0019t a single squeak or rattle even over broken pavement. The suspension soaks up bumps very well. Whereas the S80 kind of crashes over expansion joints and is a bit crude over small bumps and my old Mercedes is a little on the firm side of things, the Tesla just kind of glides along and is very comfy. Sometimes the ride is even luxury-car soft. Love the ambient light as well. It\u0019s bright during the day and at night when you first get in the car. When it\u0019s dark out, it dims to a lovely soft glow when you put the car in drive. Naturally, coming from old gas cars the acceleration of the Tesla is a blast. Love the glass roof as well, but obviously that\u0019s not exclusive to the Highland.\n\nAs a vintage car guy, I\u0019m not super crazy about the the fact that everything is in the screen but since most modern cars are going in this direction I\u0019ll give it a pass because it\u0019s a snappy and intuitive interface. All in all, this is a superb car to spend lots of time in. Can\u0019t wait for our winter trip to Austria, Italy and France.\n\nWhat I\u0019m not too crazy about: obviously the biggest elephant in the room are the stalks. You get used to the steering wheel controls rather quickly and frankly on the highway it\u0019s not an issue at all. Where it becomes annoying is the sharp turns that we have here and roundabouts. A driver shouldn\u0019t need to look down to see where their turn signals or wiper controls went so in my view that\u0019s just not a clever design. I mispressed because of that a handful of times. Clearly a mild annoyance, but not a dealbreaker. Another thing is that autopilot shuts off completely when changing lanes on the highway, so not just autosteer but cruise control turns off quite abruptly as well when you\u0019re interfering with it. This is rather irritating and it makes me avoid autopilot in dense traffic. The auto wipers (that seem like a running gag here on Reddit, along with the park assist) are too sensitive. Park assist is mildly infuriating with its incessant beeps and bongs while completely misjudging distances. I turned it off entirely because it would freak out even on intersections because it saw lane markings as obstacles. This is my biggest issue with the car and I suppose Tesla in general: if it\u0019s not ready and doesn\u0019t work as advertised, don\u0019t sell it to paying customers as something it isn\u0019t. Make me pay for proper parking sensors and rain sensing wipers, but this just isn\u0019t good enough.\n\nBy now I\u0019ve gotten used to the looks of the car. I find it handsome and restrained, and the Ultra Red is a brilliant color. It took some time, because the old 3 had kind of grown on me with its big, fish-like eyes that gave it real character in a way that was a welcome departure for all those angry-faced and overwrought new cars. The Highland is, in my eyes, a more conservative design. It\u0019s fresh and a bit more modern than the outgoing car, but from some angles it looks sleek and elegant while from others it looked a bit like a door stop to me at first =, I guess it took me some time to grow fond of the design because my eyes have a strong preference for the straight lines and boxy shapes of 80s cars so I think it just needs to age a little :)\n\nIf you have any questions, ask away!",

Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect [5-star safety rating](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa) as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government.\n\nIn addition, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which offers 240 miles of range, a top speed of 140 mph, 0-60 mph acceleration of just 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior.\n\nTo achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only. You can now buy a Tesla in North America via your phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn\u0019t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free. With the highest consumer satisfaction score of any car on the road, we are confident you will want to keep your Model 3.\n\nShifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. The important thing for customers in the United States to understand is that, with online sales, anyone in any state can quickly and easily buy a Tesla.\n\nAt the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you, rather than you coming to us. Moreover, we guarantee service availability anywhere in any countries in which we operate.\n\nWe\u0019re also excited to announce that we\u0019re implementing a number of firmware upgrades for both new and existing customers. These upgrades will increase the range of the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 to 325 miles, increase the top speed of Model 3 Performance to 162 mph, and add an average of approximately 5% peak power to all Model 3 vehicles.\n\nTesla is committed to making not just the best electric cars, but the best cars, period. And our products are the reason we continue to [rank #1 in Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/10-most-satisfying-cars-owner-satisfaction/) and have every single year since Tesla was first eligible to be included in 2013. Both Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are available starting today at [Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA).",

      "text": "Hello Everyone, I will attempt to keep this brief (who am I kidding? :) ) BUT to the point.\n\n  \nPicked up a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance with FSD/Autopilot, October 7th 2019. It was amazingly fast, coming from a 2011 BMW M3 Manual, the P3D is an amazing performer. I still love my M3 and will probably now modify it even more to compete with the P3D.. but I digress.. I have observed (some not verifiable yet; but working on getting the tools to perform the tests) the following issues with the vehicle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) During Supercharging do you hear random \"Clunks\" or \"Thumps\" randomly? In the span of 45 minutes, I will hear 5 to 6 random thumps that emanate from the body. I also noticed getting the same thumps, when driving down a mountain road, and can sustain a recharge while going downhill for a few minutes. \n\nI akin the sound to the individual battery cells bursting.. :)\n\n2) The car performed flawlessly with Software version 2019.36.x.. the power increase was observable. Then I updated to 2019.40.x., and the car seems to have lost its raw power.. Acceleration isn't as exhilarating as it was before. Initially I thought that I got used to the car ( I will be verifying the 0-60 times with hardware timers once they arrive caused by the Christmas shipping lag.) \n\nMy suspicions of nerfed acceleration got additional \"fuel\" after driving 80 miles at 72 degree weather to my destination. The car wasn't feeling as strong, battery was at 90 miles remaining. \n\nI happened to come to a stop light and decided to see if I'm just hallucinating. Road conditions were clean, dry, straight, no dips, and no loose gravel or anything that could potentially trigger traction control. Tires have 3000 miles on them. \n\nLight turns green, I slam on the accelerator pedal, I get a quick lurch forward (0-6 mph), then power loss for 1 second ( I literally thought the car died), then it accelerates, but not as it should. I haven't been able to reproduce that issue again; I've tried accelerating on wet roads to see whether I can reproduce that power loss; nothing yet. \n\nSince then I have been even more skeptical if the car is performing as it should be (will be making an appointment with the Manufacturer to go over my concerns)\n\nNOTE: Yesterday I received the 2019.40.50 update (FSD Visualization) \n\n3) I do quite a bit of driving with the car; on the weekends, I will typically drive from San Diego to LA (about 110 miles) and consume approximately 130 to 140 battery miles. I figure with the lights, radio, A/C, heater that there will be parasitic losses. I also drive a \"bit\" over the speed limit so I am quite aware that I won't be getting the ranges advertised by the EPA and Tesla. However, today coming back from LA to San Diego caused me great concern. \n\nI was up at Angeles Crest in the morning, weather was in the 30s. When we were about to leave, the car reported that my tire pressures have dropped down to 36 to 37 psi on all four. Those numbers aren't low based on previous experiences, so I drove down the mountain with no  issues. A total of 40 battery miles was used for a 33 mile trip. The car rested a few hours in 60 degree weather. I head to a supercharger and charge the vehicle to 224 miles. It was late and I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for the remaining miles.\n\nUpon leaving the supercharger, weather conditions were 50 degrees and raining. I drive the 110 miles back to home, mostly \"downhill\" from LA to San Diego county. Tires at 37 to 38 psi, and the **car battery went from 224 miles to 22** miles when I finally reached my destination. I drove a conservative speed of 70  mph on average the entire trip.  \n\n200 battery miles to go 110 miles, 37 psi tires, 50 degree weather, raining, average speed of 70 mph.. \n\nDid the tire pressure make that much of a difference? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're able to relate to any of these issues with the Model 3, please let me know. In the meantime I plan to make an appointment and address these issues with the Tesla technician. I just wanted to know if my observations have any validity. \n\nIf I have posted against the rules, my sincere apologies, and I will remove.\n\nHappy Holidays to Everyone, may you have a safe and happy holiday!",

      "text": "What do you guys think? The AWD model 3 has been the middle child of the model 3 family-- every other trim has had upgrades, and in the case of track mode for the performance version, even exclusive features.\n\nThe email:\n\n&gt;I am not asking for a refund. I\u0019m happy with the amount I paid.\n&gt;I am upset, however, that my car has been devalued by the new pricing. \n\n&gt;My solution is a simple one. \n&gt;It is sustainable. \n&gt;It should be relatively easy.\n&gt;It would cost Tesla nothing.\n&gt;It would help restore the value of my car.\n\n&gt;I want a performance unlock / uncorking. \n&gt;I don\u0019t want the rest of the performance trim/package, and the AWD uses the exact same motors and inverters as the performance model, so the restriction is purely software.\n\n&gt;The AWD was artificially restricted to 4.5s 0-60 and has remained there, while every other version of the 3 was faster than initially advertised and are STILL getting faster, with no hardware changes. (The RWD only model started off a full second slower to 60 than the AWD, and is now only half a second slower. Meanwhile, the performance model dropped by 0.3 seconds and got track mode. The AWD has had no upgrades or new features.\n\n&gt;I\u0019d actually be very happy with the 3.5s the performance trim was originally rated at. The performance owners\u0014those who paid the most\u0014would still have a substantial performance edge on the AWD owners.\n\n&gt;Plus, they still get nicer brakes, wheels, tires, spoilers, ride height, and track mode. This would just help to assuage the burning sensation felt by the owners whose cars\u0019 values took the largest hit.\n",

Other coverages also rose by a lot in % terms. \n\nMy insurer claims that the culprit is the IIHS safety ranking for the 2023 vs 2019. Here's what they claimed:\n&gt; The IIHS- Insurance Institute for HIghway Safety does the test crash ratings and based on what they find, they assign each vehicle a symbol number based on the safety of the vehicle, how much damage is sustained and also the cost of parts and labor. The 2019 Tesla had a vehicle symbol for comprehensive of 35 and 40 for collision. The 2023 has a comprehensive symbol of 52 and collision of 66.\n\nThe higher the number, the higher the premium.\n\nAnybody in the business who can verify those numbers? Seems ridiculous for pretty much the same car with the same cost of replacement parts etc (okay, minus the USS).\n\nAnybody in the same situation who found a carrier with decent rates?\n\nP.S.

Well, I found out if I rent out a garage along with my apartment I will have access to a standard outlet to charge on. From what I read I should get 4-5 miles/hr off and this and my daily commute will be a total of 40 so I think this should work out fine and hoping it is sustainable on the battery.\n\nThat brings me to my next point where I am really leaning toward leasing it (thinking 2 years/15k miles). I really would like to get the newest technology every couple of years and especially this time since I am hoping the refresh will release by the time my lease is up. Not only that but it is much more affordable so I do not see why it wouldn't be a good idea. I have heard some bad things about leasing from Tesla so I just wanted to see if anyone had good to say about it.  \n\n\nLastly, I wanted to see if anyone has been in this situation. So I live in Ohio and the summer tires that come on the performance are just not gonna happen since I am going to order it any idea on if there is a way to request different tires or how could I go about this situation to get at least all-season tires.",

      "title": "Impressions After 1 Month",
      "text": "So I have driven my Tesla Model 3 every day now for exactly a month. At this point in time, I can safely (apparently) say that I am pretty adjusted to how the vehicle works. Here are my impressions over the same topics I covered from a month ago.\n\n**Build Quality**\n\nThis is definitely a pretty widespread (and rightfully so) opinion at this point, though I am sure some Tesla fanboy will try to bury me with all sorts of reports and what not trying to prove it is FUD. From my own personal experience however, the build quality of my Model 3 can be best described as subpar starting from the materials all the way to the overall build. Here are some of the problems I have noticed.\n\nMy biggest annoyance is with internal cabin noise. It is LOUD inside my Model 3 (coming from a 2014 Lexus ES350). Whether it be tire / road noise, wind noise, or rattling (completely non-existent in my previous Lexus), the M3 has been by far and away the loudest car I have ever driven and louder than most cars I have ridden in. Maybe my buddy\u0019s MS was just built better, but I don\u0019t recall it being anywhere as loud as my M3 is. If I go over 20 mph, I start hearing road noise. If I go over 40 mph, I start hearing wind noise. If I go over 50 mph, I start hearing small rattling noises here and there. These should not be issues in a $30K priced car, much less one sold for just under $50K. Cherry on top, when I took it to the SC within a week (well within 100 miles), I was told that this was a \u001ccharacteristic of the frameless design\u001d and that Tesla would not be attempting to \u001cfix\u001d it for me. First off, that sounds real sketch to me. I have been in cars that had frameless designs and not a single one have had those issues. Two, if your design introduces that much cabin noise, WHY would you proceed with said design?! They ended the experience by sending me home, saying to schedule another appointment if it gets worse.\n\nNext would be the seats. While the material soft and have a nice feel when it\u0019s not super hot, the non-porous material and lack of ventilated seats really make for a miserable experience in TX. My Lexus has cooled seats, why doesn\u0019t my M3 which was more expensive by the tune of almost $10K? Going back to the vegan leather material, I don\u0019t care how much they make it feel like leather or how environmentally friendly it might be, non-porous (while easier to clean) is not breathable and that sucks when it\u0019s really hot or you sat in the chair long enough to build up a lot of heat. There is a reason why people prefer fabric or real leather over vegan and it\u0019s because both have the ability to sustain you through heat much more comfortably. I ended up ordering some Katzkin leather seats with their ventilated cooling on the driver side and will be getting all of that installed tomorrow. Going back to Tesla, leather seats really should have been a purchasable upgrade (similarly to their premium audio setup) for the consumers who actually want it.\n\nPaint quality, at least for my chosen blue color, is pretty thin and not evenly applied. This includes both the actual paint and the clear coat applied over it. I imagine this is why a lot of people get PPF, because the paint (on the M3 at least) does get easily dinged up. I myself haven\u0019t installed PPF yet as I didn\u0019t consider a $2K cosmetic expense worthwhile for a $50K car, but I have since reconsidered my options given how easy it is to get swirls, chips, and fine scratches on this M3 compared to my Lexus. Now, whether that would be for full body or just the front or even just the front bumper, I am still on the fence regarding that decision.\n\n**Driving Interface**\n\nMy biggest issue is the lack of even the most simplest of instrument gauge outside of the center touchscreen. While I got used to it, I still ended up purchasing recently the \u001cHansshow Hidden HUD\u001d (not actually a HUD) for my steering wheel dash. There is simply zero good reason of why some sort of basic dash display wasn\u0019t included behind the steering other than to cut costs. No, I do not accept the argument that not having a basic instrument gauge behind the steering wheel is safe as it keeps your eyes on the road. Something as basic as knowing how fast you are going at all times is a basic part of safe driving and the idea that glancing down and right at the center touchscreen is somehow safer than a slightly downward glance through the steering wheel gap is somehow safer is total bunk to me. Offloading most features and controls to a central touchscreen IS the future, but getting rid of all gauges from the steering wheel dash is NOT the answer. There is a reason why the MX and MS both have a steering dash display and no, it\u0019s not because they use a yoke.\n\n**Air Conditioning**\n\nI didn\u0019t put this under build quality, because this is by design to cool the batters as I understand it. Regardless, the AC unit when on auto feels incredibly week compared to every other car I have driven or ridden in. I have it set to 70 on auto, which for every other car I have driven means pretty dang cold. 70 on my M3 feels about 77. This has resulted in me running the AC much colder than I normally would have. This may be a feature, but I really dislike it as a Texan.\n\n**Regenerative Braking and One Pedal Driving**\n\nI will readily admit that I really disliked this feature in certain driving situations. Having gotten used to it finally, I can now say that I really like the feature. It allows me to not have to think about switching to the brake pedal most of the time, which is always a good thing. As far as saving battery or brake pads, I have no real opinions on this yet as I charge every day at work so power is a non-issue and the car is too new for the brake pad aspect to be validated yet. While it definitely makes sense, at the same time the M3 is a hefty car for its size so it remains to be seen on how much longer my brake pads actually last in comparison.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nIn my previous impressions post, I ended it by saying that the Tesla is less a luxury car and more a piece of smart tech. A month later, I continue to stand by that assertion. From a \u001ccar\u001d perspective, there are some design quality and decisions that I feel none of us (consumers) should be willing to accept / tolerate and consequently allow Tesla to get away with. Some (a lot) of you might disagree with that and that\u0019s fine. Going beyond that, would I buy another Tesla? If it\u0019s right now, absolutely. There is not a single car in the same price range that is more fun to drive on your every day roads. Among the EVs, Tesla is still far ahead of the curve in terms of hardware, software, and charging network that another EV is not really a serious consideration. 5-10 years from now when I am thinking about a new car though? That\u0019s hard to say as even the 2023-24 EVs (like the Hyundai IONIQ 6 for example) look very nice and charging stations should be much more populous by then. Tesla has the luxury of being really the only serious option right now, which allows them to get away from a lot of their quality and feature removal shenanigans currently, but down the line when there are other serious alternatives, I can easily seeing things coming back and biting Tesla if they don\u0019t make some serious improvements.\n\nOh yeah, not having to pay for gas feels good!",

      "text": "TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM.\n\nHi looking at a house that comes pre-set with a 220v 50A NEMA 14-50 outlet in the garage.\n\nBy my math that would get me about 32A charge rate with the NEMA 14-50 adaptor for the mobile charger which would charge at 30mi/hr rate.\n\nOr roughly 10hrs for full charge from zero (or 6 hrs from 20% to 80% which is more than the typical expected daily charge).\n\nAlternatively it looks like I could just remove the outlet, and put the wiring directly into the Tesla wall charger to achieve 40A and charge at roughly 37mi/hr.\n\nIn order to achieve 48A I would have to replace the NEMA 14-50 outlet, breaker and wiring to sustain 48A I.e. 60A instead of the 50A which is in there.\n\nCheaper to just put the wall charger inches from the panel in the garage to save on wiring/just keep the 220V 50A as is?\n\nIt would charge at 44mi/hr.\n\nSeems a full charge at 32A is 10hrs, at 40A is 8hrs, and at 48A is 6.7hrs.\n\nNot sure there\u0019s a noticeable difference between 6.7hrs vs 8hrs for a full charge. And assuming 0%-80% would be the max regularly charged, it\u0019s 8hrs for the 32A and 6.5hrs for the 40A.\n\nNot sure the 48A route is even necessary unless you\u0019re potentially charging multiple cars at once, but otherwise seems like the middle ground of replacing the outlet with the Tesla wall charger for 40A is good enough.\n\nTL:DR: Has anyone replaced a 50A NEMA 14-50 outlet with the wall charger?

      "text": "In 2.5 years of ownership with my RWD model 3, I'm familiar with most weird sounds on my Model 3. The engine whining sound while charging on a cold day.   The humming fan while sitting idle.  Normal stuff.  This next one has me stumped.\n\nDriving home last night on city roads between 20-40mph. The best way to describe this sound is \"a sustained electric hum\" or perhaps the feedback sound an electric guitar generates when it's pressed up next to its amp with a string still vibrating.\n\nI literally thought it was the outro fade to the hard rock song I was playing loud.  Then I paused the music player and turned the volume to zero.  And it's still going and getting slightly louder with the speed of the car.  \n\nIt was definitely coming from the front of the car.  And if I had to guess, it was coming from the speakers.  Could have been the frunk or wheels, but it pervasive.  The sound disappeared after I slowed down to 0mph at a stop sign.  It did not return when I resumed driving.\n\nGot home and rebooted the MCU.  Drove a nearly identical route back and forth this morning and heard nothing unusual.\n\nBest guesses:\n\n* Electrical interference from the engine coming out the speakers?\n* Bug in the MCU or media player.\n* Some bluetooth/phone issue? \n\nAnyone else got any ideas?",

      "text": "The Trip and Last Used in the car is a decent indicator, but I just wish the mi/Kw metric added an additional decimal point since 3mi/Wh vs 4mi/Wh vs 5mi/Wh is a huge difference\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla says range of 75Wh cells = \\~310 mi.  310/75 = 4.13mi/Wh.\n\nObviously the more miles we get from each Wh, the better (based upon driving habits/temperature, etc...)\n\nAnother way to look at it: the 310 mi calculation is done with the expectation that on average, you would use 242Wh per mile.  242 \\* 310 = 75Wh.  So in this case, lower Wh/mi the better.  Sometimes during the beginning of driving, I would see it jump up to 400/500Wh/mi (meaning, if you were to sustain that 500Wh/mi, your actual range would be around 150 mi since it 75Wh/500W/mi = 150 mi!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyways, like other (hybrid) cars that measure in mpg (I've used a hybrid where if I go really slow I can hit 60mpg in 1 min increments, but realistically for the entire drive I would be getting 35-40mpg).  Therefore I'm looking for something that can either chart mi/Wh (so I assume you would go as low as 2mi/Wh and as high as 6mi/Wh, with the average of 4mi/Wh), or chart it in terms of watts (maybe 150Wh/mi at the lowest and 500Wh/mi at the highest, with average 250Wh/mi), in 1 minute increments.",

      "text": "I wanted to share some electrifying news that I recently stumbled upon, and I couldn't contain my excitement! It appears that Tesla has made a groundbreaking decision to open up its Supercharging network to other vehicle manufacturers. Can you imagine the potential this holds for the future of EV charging?\n\nTesla's Supercharger network has always been renowned for its speed, convenience, and reliability. But now, with this move, it's poised to become an even more inclusive charging ecosystem. The prospect of welcoming other EV brands into the Tesla charging family is a game-changer that could revolutionize the way we all charge our electric vehicles.\n\nJust picture it: pulling up to a Supercharger station and seeing not just Tesla vehicles, but a diverse array of electric cars from various manufacturers. This not only expands the charging options for non-Tesla owners but also promotes a sense of unity within the EV community.\n\nTesla's decision to share its charging infrastructure signifies a significant step towards fostering collaboration and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles on a global scale. It's a clear testament to the company's commitment to sustainable transportation, pushing boundaries beyond its own product line to drive positive change.\n\nOf course, there will likely be some adjustments and considerations that Tesla will need to address to ensure a smooth integration process. Factors such as payment methods, interoperability, and charging protocols might require careful coordination, but I have no doubt that Tesla will rise to the occasion.\n\nAs we eagerly await further details and developments, let's celebrate this bold move by Tesla, recognizing the potential it holds for expanding the accessibility and convenience of EV charging. The more charging options we have, the closer we get to a sustainable future where electric vehicles dominate the roads.\n\nSo, fellow EV enthusiasts, what are your thoughts on this exciting news? How do you envision the Supercharging experience evolving with the arrival of other vehicle brands?",

      "text": "https://youtu.be/m39QcNz5my4?t=1343 Watch this to see how Tesla suppresses post like these to protect their company from bad publicity. \n\nI had my Model 3 for 2 years, was a reservation holder and took delivery January 2018. Bought it with the EAP/FSD package and it was perfect until November 2019. That's when the car first tried to take a non existing freeway exit into a center divider on a freeway. I reported the bug, only to have it happen again the next day. Both times I corrected it and saved myself from a high speed crash contest with a wall. 1 week later it tried to do the same thing and again I stopped the cars attempted steer into the wall. I've posted about this before here. \n\nFinally one month later in December I had Autopilot driving at 55 mph, 10 miles bellow the speed limit, the same as everyone else in Traffic because of heavy rain. The car tried steering itself into an invisible exit towards the center divider forcing me to stop it yet again, except this time the slight attempted steer it got in before I could take the wheel away from autopilot started making the car hydroplane. I rammed into the wall 5 times spinning in circles. By sheer luck no other cars hit me and got involved, though my car did end up being deemed a total loss after that. \n\nThere were articles in January noting the high increase in Tesla Autopilot crashes, though tesla blamed it on the adverse weather. I drove the car in adverse weather in 2018's winter months without a problem. I suspect the high increase was caused by other drivers experiencing the same bug making the car try to take invisible on existent exits into walls. I hope Tesla has fixed this today, but I have yet to replace my car thanks to Tesla's insurance taking forever to deem my car a loss, value it, and pay out my bank.\n\n*If anyone else was in an autopilot crash, or had experienced this bug that tries to take non existing exits, please contact me. I am writing up an article about it for some news outlets that are interested in this story.*\n\nand I know Tesla fan boys will downvote this immediately hiding it from any significant awareness, but just note that this is a dangerous flaw that Tesla needs to be aware of and fix, yet lately I just see them sweep it under the rug and ignore it. 1 apple engineer has already died because of a bug that is described as being exactly what I experienced. Let's not let more lives be lost by ignoring a serious issue. I'm a Tesla share holder too, so not trying to bring bad press for the sake of tanking the stock. Instead I want them to fix serious issues so more deaths in the future don't further hurt the company doing the most to propel our technological advancement and sustainability in the future",

Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect [5-star safety rating](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa) as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government.\n\nIn addition, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which offers 240 miles of range, a top speed of 140 mph, 0-60 mph acceleration of just 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior.\n\nTo achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only. You can now buy a Tesla in North America via your phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn\u0019t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free. With the highest consumer satisfaction score of any car on the road, we are confident you will want to keep your Model 3.\n\nShifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. The important thing for customers in the United States to understand is that, with online sales, anyone in any state can quickly and easily buy a Tesla.\n\nAt the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you, rather than you coming to us. Moreover, we guarantee service availability anywhere in any countries in which we operate.\n\nWe\u0019re also excited to announce that we\u0019re implementing a number of firmware upgrades for both new and existing customers. These upgrades will increase the range of the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 to 325 miles, increase the top speed of Model 3 Performance to 162 mph, and add an average of approximately 5% peak power to all Model 3 vehicles.\n\nTesla is committed to making not just the best electric cars, but the best cars, period. And our products are the reason we continue to [rank #1 in Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/10-most-satisfying-cars-owner-satisfaction/) and have every single year since Tesla was first eligible to be included in 2013. Both Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are available starting today at [Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA).",

We are going to take the thing you paid $15k for, that you can sell your current vehicle with intact indefinitely, and instead tie it solely to the ownership period of one single person, not the car, not the person?

      "text": "Hello Everyone, I will attempt to keep this brief (who am I kidding? :) ) BUT to the point.\n\n  \nPicked up a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance with FSD/Autopilot, October 7th 2019. It was amazingly fast, coming from a 2011 BMW M3 Manual, the P3D is an amazing performer. I still love my M3 and will probably now modify it even more to compete with the P3D.. but I digress.. I have observed (some not verifiable yet; but working on getting the tools to perform the tests) the following issues with the vehicle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) During Supercharging do you hear random \"Clunks\" or \"Thumps\" randomly? In the span of 45 minutes, I will hear 5 to 6 random thumps that emanate from the body. I also noticed getting the same thumps, when driving down a mountain road, and can sustain a recharge while going downhill for a few minutes. \n\nI akin the sound to the individual battery cells bursting.. :)\n\n2) The car performed flawlessly with Software version 2019.36.x.. the power increase was observable. Then I updated to 2019.40.x., and the car seems to have lost its raw power.. Acceleration isn't as exhilarating as it was before. Initially I thought that I got used to the car ( I will be verifying the 0-60 times with hardware timers once they arrive caused by the Christmas shipping lag.) \n\nMy suspicions of nerfed acceleration got additional \"fuel\" after driving 80 miles at 72 degree weather to my destination. The car wasn't feeling as strong, battery was at 90 miles remaining. \n\nI happened to come to a stop light and decided to see if I'm just hallucinating. Road conditions were clean, dry, straight, no dips, and no loose gravel or anything that could potentially trigger traction control. Tires have 3000 miles on them. \n\nLight turns green, I slam on the accelerator pedal, I get a quick lurch forward (0-6 mph), then power loss for 1 second ( I literally thought the car died), then it accelerates, but not as it should. I haven't been able to reproduce that issue again; I've tried accelerating on wet roads to see whether I can reproduce that power loss; nothing yet. \n\nSince then I have been even more skeptical if the car is performing as it should be (will be making an appointment with the Manufacturer to go over my concerns)\n\nNOTE: Yesterday I received the 2019.40.50 update (FSD Visualization) \n\n3) I do quite a bit of driving with the car; on the weekends, I will typically drive from San Diego to LA (about 110 miles) and consume approximately 130 to 140 battery miles. I figure with the lights, radio, A/C, heater that there will be parasitic losses. I also drive a \"bit\" over the speed limit so I am quite aware that I won't be getting the ranges advertised by the EPA and Tesla. However, today coming back from LA to San Diego caused me great concern. \n\nI was up at Angeles Crest in the morning, weather was in the 30s. When we were about to leave, the car reported that my tire pressures have dropped down to 36 to 37 psi on all four. Those numbers aren't low based on previous experiences, so I drove down the mountain with no  issues. A total of 40 battery miles was used for a 33 mile trip. The car rested a few hours in 60 degree weather. I head to a supercharger and charge the vehicle to 224 miles. It was late and I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for the remaining miles.\n\nUpon leaving the supercharger, weather conditions were 50 degrees and raining. I drive the 110 miles back to home, mostly \"downhill\" from LA to San Diego county. Tires at 37 to 38 psi, and the **car battery went from 224 miles to 22** miles when I finally reached my destination. I drove a conservative speed of 70  mph on average the entire trip.  \n\n200 battery miles to go 110 miles, 37 psi tires, 50 degree weather, raining, average speed of 70 mph.. \n\nDid the tire pressure make that much of a difference? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're able to relate to any of these issues with the Model 3, please let me know. In the meantime I plan to make an appointment and address these issues with the Tesla technician. I just wanted to know if my observations have any validity. \n\nIf I have posted against the rules, my sincere apologies, and I will remove.\n\nHappy Holidays to Everyone, may you have a safe and happy holiday!",

(The RWD only model started off a full second slower to 60 than the AWD, and is now only half a second slower. Meanwhile, the performance model dropped by 0.3 seconds and got track mode. The AWD has had no upgrades or new features.\n\n&gt;I\u0019d actually be very happy with the 3.5s the performance trim was originally rated at. The performance owners\u0014those who paid the most\u0014would still have a substantial performance edge on the AWD owners.\n\n&gt;Plus, they still get nicer brakes, wheels, tires, spoilers, ride height, and track mode.

Other coverages also rose by a lot in % terms. \n\nMy insurer claims that the culprit is the IIHS safety ranking for the 2023 vs 2019. Here's what they claimed:\n&gt; The IIHS- Insurance Institute for HIghway Safety does the test crash ratings and based on what they find, they assign each vehicle a symbol number based on the safety of the vehicle, how much damage is sustained and also the cost of parts and labor. The 2019 Tesla had a vehicle symbol for comprehensive of 35 and 40 for collision. The 2023 has a comprehensive symbol of 52 and collision of 66.\n\nThe higher the number, the higher the premium.\n\nAnybody in the business who can verify those numbers? Seems ridiculous for pretty much the same car with the same cost of replacement parts etc (okay, minus the USS).\n\nAnybody in the same situation who found a carrier with decent rates?\n\nP.S. Not going with Tesla Insurance. I frequently go to track/autox events, which will kill my 'safety rating.'",

      "text": "I made a post here like a week ago about getting Tesla and realized my charging situation made it not worth it. Well, I found out if I rent out a garage along with my apartment I will have access to a standard outlet to charge on. From what I read I should get 4-5 miles/hr off and this and my daily commute will be a total of 40 so I think this should work out fine and hoping it is sustainable on the battery.\n\nThat brings me to my next point where I am really leaning toward leasing it (thinking 2 years/15k miles). I really would like to get the newest technology every couple of years and especially this time since I am hoping the refresh will release by the time my lease is up. Not only that but it is much more affordable so I do not see why it wouldn't be a good idea. I have heard some bad things about leasing from Tesla so I just wanted to see if anyone had good to say about it.  \n\n\nLastly, I wanted to see if anyone has been in this situation. So I live in Ohio and the summer tires that come on the performance are just not gonna happen since I am going to order it any idea on if there is a way to request different tires or how could I go about this situation to get at least all-season tires.",

      "title": "Impressions After 1 Month",
      "text": "So I have driven my Tesla Model 3 every day now for exactly a month. At this point in time, I can safely (apparently) say that I am pretty adjusted to how the vehicle works. Here are my impressions over the same topics I covered from a month ago.\n\n**Build Quality**\n\nThis is definitely a pretty widespread (and rightfully so) opinion at this point, though I am sure some Tesla fanboy will try to bury me with all sorts of reports and what not trying to prove it is FUD. From my own personal experience however, the build quality of my Model 3 can be best described as subpar starting from the materials all the way to the overall build. Here are some of the problems I have noticed.\n\nMy biggest annoyance is with internal cabin noise. It is LOUD inside my Model 3 (coming from a 2014 Lexus ES350). Whether it be tire / road noise, wind noise, or rattling (completely non-existent in my previous Lexus), the M3 has been by far and away the loudest car I have ever driven and louder than most cars I have ridden in. Maybe my buddy\u0019s MS was just built better, but I don\u0019t recall it being anywhere as loud as my M3 is. If I go over 20 mph, I start hearing road noise. If I go over 40 mph, I start hearing wind noise. If I go over 50 mph, I start hearing small rattling noises here and there. These should not be issues in a $30K priced car, much less one sold for just under $50K. Cherry on top, when I took it to the SC within a week (well within 100 miles), I was told that this was a \u001ccharacteristic of the frameless design\u001d and that Tesla would not be attempting to \u001cfix\u001d it for me. First off, that sounds real sketch to me. I have been in cars that had frameless designs and not a single one have had those issues. Two, if your design introduces that much cabin noise, WHY would you proceed with said design?! They ended the experience by sending me home, saying to schedule another appointment if it gets worse.\n\nNext would be the seats. While the material soft and have a nice feel when it\u0019s not super hot, the non-porous material and lack of ventilated seats really make for a miserable experience in TX. My Lexus has cooled seats, why doesn\u0019t my M3 which was more expensive by the tune of almost $10K? Going back to the vegan leather material, I don\u0019t care how much they make it feel like leather or how environmentally friendly it might be, non-porous (while easier to clean) is not breathable and that sucks when it\u0019s really hot or you sat in the chair long enough to build up a lot of heat. There is a reason why people prefer fabric or real leather over vegan and it\u0019s because both have the ability to sustain you through heat much more comfortably. I ended up ordering some Katzkin leather seats with their ventilated cooling on the driver side and will be getting all of that installed tomorrow. Going back to Tesla, leather seats really should have been a purchasable upgrade (similarly to their premium audio setup) for the consumers who actually want it.\n\nPaint quality, at least for my chosen blue color, is pretty thin and not evenly applied. This includes both the actual paint and the clear coat applied over it. I imagine this is why a lot of people get PPF, because the paint (on the M3 at least) does get easily dinged up. I myself haven\u0019t installed PPF yet as I didn\u0019t consider a $2K cosmetic expense worthwhile for a $50K car, but I have since reconsidered my options given how easy it is to get swirls, chips, and fine scratches on this M3 compared to my Lexus. Now, whether that would be for full body or just the front or even just the front bumper, I am still on the fence regarding that decision.\n\n**Driving Interface**\n\nMy biggest issue is the lack of even the most simplest of instrument gauge outside of the center touchscreen. While I got used to it, I still ended up purchasing recently the \u001cHansshow Hidden HUD\u001d (not actually a HUD) for my steering wheel dash. There is simply zero good reason of why some sort of basic dash display wasn\u0019t included behind the steering other than to cut costs. No, I do not accept the argument that not having a basic instrument gauge behind the steering wheel is safe as it keeps your eyes on the road. Something as basic as knowing how fast you are going at all times is a basic part of safe driving and the idea that glancing down and right at the center touchscreen is somehow safer than a slightly downward glance through the steering wheel gap is somehow safer is total bunk to me. Offloading most features and controls to a central touchscreen IS the future, but getting rid of all gauges from the steering wheel dash is NOT the answer. There is a reason why the MX and MS both have a steering dash display and no, it\u0019s not because they use a yoke.\n\n**Air Conditioning**\n\nI didn\u0019t put this under build quality, because this is by design to cool the batters as I understand it. Regardless, the AC unit when on auto feels incredibly week compared to every other car I have driven or ridden in. I have it set to 70 on auto, which for every other car I have driven means pretty dang cold. 70 on my M3 feels about 77. This has resulted in me running the AC much colder than I normally would have. This may be a feature, but I really dislike it as a Texan.\n\n**Regenerative Braking and One Pedal Driving**\n\nI will readily admit that I really disliked this feature in certain driving situations. Having gotten used to it finally, I can now say that I really like the feature. It allows me to not have to think about switching to the brake pedal most of the time, which is always a good thing. As far as saving battery or brake pads, I have no real opinions on this yet as I charge every day at work so power is a non-issue and the car is too new for the brake pad aspect to be validated yet. While it definitely makes sense, at the same time the M3 is a hefty car for its size so it remains to be seen on how much longer my brake pads actually last in comparison.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nIn my previous impressions post, I ended it by saying that the Tesla is less a luxury car and more a piece of smart tech. A month later, I continue to stand by that assertion. From a \u001ccar\u001d perspective, there are some design quality and decisions that I feel none of us (consumers) should be willing to accept / tolerate and consequently allow Tesla to get away with. Some (a lot) of you might disagree with that and that\u0019s fine. Going beyond that, would I buy another Tesla? If it\u0019s right now, absolutely. There is not a single car in the same price range that is more fun to drive on your every day roads. Among the EVs, Tesla is still far ahead of the curve in terms of hardware, software, and charging network that another EV is not really a serious consideration. 5-10 years from now when I am thinking about a new car though? That\u0019s hard to say as even the 2023-24 EVs (like the Hyundai IONIQ 6 for example) look very nice and charging stations should be much more populous by then. Tesla has the luxury of being really the only serious option right now, which allows them to get away from a lot of their quality and feature removal shenanigans currently, but down the line when there are other serious alternatives, I can easily seeing things coming back and biting Tesla if they don\u0019t make some serious improvements.\n\nOh yeah, not having to pay for gas feels good!",

      "text": "TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM.\n\nHi looking at a house that comes pre-set with a 220v 50A NEMA 14-50 outlet in the garage.\n\nBy my math that would get me about 32A charge rate with the NEMA 14-50 adaptor for the mobile charger which would charge at 30mi/hr rate.\n\nOr roughly 10hrs for full charge from zero (or 6 hrs from 20% to 80% which is more than the typical expected daily charge).\n\nAlternatively it looks like I could just remove the outlet, and put the wiring directly into the Tesla wall charger to achieve 40A and charge at roughly 37mi/hr.\n\nIn order to achieve 48A I would have to replace the NEMA 14-50 outlet, breaker and wiring to sustain 48A I.e. 60A instead of the 50A which is in there.\n\nCheaper to just put the wall charger inches from the panel in the garage to save on wiring/just keep the 220V 50A as is?\n\nIt would charge at 44mi/hr.\n\nSeems a full charge at 32A is 10hrs, at 40A is 8hrs, and at 48A is 6.7hrs.\n\nNot sure there\u0019s a noticeable difference between 6.7hrs vs 8hrs for a full charge. And assuming 0%-80% would be the max regularly charged, it\u0019s 8hrs for the 32A and 6.5hrs for the 40A.\n\nNot sure the 48A route is even necessary unless you\u0019re potentially charging multiple cars at once, but otherwise seems like the middle ground of replacing the outlet with the Tesla wall charger for 40A is good enough.\n\nTL:DR: Has anyone replaced a 50A NEMA 14-50 outlet with the wall charger? Was it difficult/worth it?",

      "text": "The Trip and Last Used in the car is a decent indicator, but I just wish the mi/Kw metric added an additional decimal point since 3mi/Wh vs 4mi/Wh vs 5mi/Wh is a huge difference\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla says range of 75Wh cells = \\~310 mi.  310/75 = 4.13mi/Wh.\n\nObviously the more miles we get from each Wh, the better (based upon driving habits/temperature, etc...)\n\nAnother way to look at it: the 310 mi calculation is done with the expectation that on average, you would use 242Wh per mile.  242 \\* 310 = 75Wh.  So in this case, lower Wh/mi the better.  Sometimes during the beginning of driving, I would see it jump up to 400/500Wh/mi (meaning, if you were to sustain that 500Wh/mi, your actual range would be around 150 mi since it 75Wh/500W/mi = 150 mi!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyways, like other (hybrid) cars that measure in mpg (I've used a hybrid where if I go really slow I can hit 60mpg in 1 min increments, but realistically for the entire drive I would be getting 35-40mpg).  Therefore I'm looking for something that can either chart mi/Wh (so I assume you would go as low as 2mi/Wh and as high as 6mi/Wh, with the average of 4mi/Wh), or chart it in terms of watts (maybe 150Wh/mi at the lowest and 500Wh/mi at the highest, with average 250Wh/mi), in 1 minute increments.",

      "text": "In 2.5 years of ownership with my RWD model 3, I'm familiar with most weird sounds on my Model 3. The engine whining sound while charging on a cold day.   The humming fan while sitting idle.  Normal stuff.  This next one has me stumped.\n\nDriving home last night on city roads between 20-40mph. The best way to describe this sound is \"a sustained electric hum\" or perhaps the feedback sound an electric guitar generates when it's pressed up next to its amp with a string still vibrating.\n\nI literally thought it was the outro fade to the hard rock song I was playing loud.  Then I paused the music player and turned the volume to zero.  And it's still going and getting slightly louder with the speed of the car.  \n\nIt was definitely coming from the front of the car.  And if I had to guess, it was coming from the speakers.  Could have been the frunk or wheels, but it pervasive.  The sound disappeared after I slowed down to 0mph at a stop sign.  It did not return when I resumed driving.\n\nGot home and rebooted the MCU.  Drove a nearly identical route back and forth this morning and heard nothing unusual.\n\nBest guesses:\n\n* Electrical interference from the engine coming out the speakers?\n* Bug in the MCU or media player.\n* Some bluetooth/phone issue? \n\nAnyone else got any ideas?",

(besides alignment obviously) \n\nShould I wait and set an appointment with the SC or does it just seem like its alignment that pep boys could take care of?  \n\n*only reason why this is a big deal to me is because I drive the car for work and put 1.5k miles a month minimum, so need to get it addressed but don\u0019t want to run into any issues in the upcoming week*\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated!",

It appears that Tesla has made a groundbreaking decision to open up its Supercharging network to other vehicle manufacturers. Can you imagine the potential this holds for the future of EV charging?\n\nTesla's Supercharger network has always been renowned for its speed, convenience, and reliability. But now, with this move, it's poised to become an even more inclusive charging ecosystem. The prospect of welcoming other EV brands into the Tesla charging family is a game-changer that could revolutionize the way we all charge our electric vehicles.\n\nJust picture it: pulling up to a Supercharger station and seeing not just Tesla vehicles, but a diverse array of electric cars from various manufacturers. This not only expands the charging options for non-Tesla owners but also promotes a sense of unity within the EV community.\n\nTesla's decision to share its charging infrastructure signifies a significant step towards fostering collaboration and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles on a global scale. It's a clear testament to the company's commitment to sustainable transportation, pushing boundaries beyond its own product line to drive positive change.\n\nOf course, there will likely be some adjustments and considerations that Tesla will need to address to ensure a smooth integration process. Factors such as payment methods, interoperability, and charging protocols might require careful coordination, but I have no doubt that Tesla will rise to the occasion.\n\nAs we eagerly await further details and developments, let's celebrate this bold move by Tesla, recognizing the potential it holds for expanding the accessibility and convenience of EV charging. The more charging options we have, the closer we get to a sustainable future where electric vehicles dominate the roads.\n\nSo, fellow EV enthusiasts, what are your thoughts on this exciting news?

      "text": "https://youtu.be/m39QcNz5my4?t=1343 Watch this to see how Tesla suppresses post like these to protect their company from bad publicity. \n\nI had my Model 3 for 2 years, was a reservation holder and took delivery January 2018. Bought it with the EAP/FSD package and it was perfect until November 2019. That's when the car first tried to take a non existing freeway exit into a center divider on a freeway. I reported the bug, only to have it happen again the next day. Both times I corrected it and saved myself from a high speed crash contest with a wall. 1 week later it tried to do the same thing and again I stopped the cars attempted steer into the wall. I've posted about this before here. \n\nFinally one month later in December I had Autopilot driving at 55 mph, 10 miles bellow the speed limit, the same as everyone else in Traffic because of heavy rain. The car tried steering itself into an invisible exit towards the center divider forcing me to stop it yet again, except this time the slight attempted steer it got in before I could take the wheel away from autopilot started making the car hydroplane. I rammed into the wall 5 times spinning in circles. By sheer luck no other cars hit me and got involved, though my car did end up being deemed a total loss after that. \n\nThere were articles in January noting the high increase in Tesla Autopilot crashes, though tesla blamed it on the adverse weather. I drove the car in adverse weather in 2018's winter months without a problem. I suspect the high increase was caused by other drivers experiencing the same bug making the car try to take invisible on existent exits into walls. I hope Tesla has fixed this today, but I have yet to replace my car thanks to Tesla's insurance taking forever to deem my car a loss, value it, and pay out my bank.\n\n*If anyone else was in an autopilot crash, or had experienced this bug that tries to take non existing exits, please contact me. I am writing up an article about it for some news outlets that are interested in this story.*\n\nand I know Tesla fan boys will downvote this immediately hiding it from any significant awareness, but just note that this is a dangerous flaw that Tesla needs to be aware of and fix, yet lately I just see them sweep it under the rug and ignore it. 1 apple engineer has already died because of a bug that is described as being exactly what I experienced. Let's not let more lives be lost by ignoring a serious issue. I'm a Tesla share holder too, so not trying to bring bad press for the sake of tanking the stock. Instead I want them to fix serious issues so more deaths in the future don't further hurt the company doing the most to propel our technological advancement and sustainability in the future",

      "text": "* With the inventory discount, the current gap between a SR and LR is about $10k.\n* Assuming I take 2 road trips every month and keep the car for 10 years, this is an additional **$40+ per trip** for the privilege of having the long range\n* T**he LR does not actually save me any charging stops** for most of my trips. Most of my long distance driving is under 200-300 miles in California. In both SR and LR models, this is the same 1 stop in each direction.\n* For the majority of my day-to-day driving in the city there is no difference between a SR and LR\n* The SR LFP battery is less prone to fire and a theoretical fire would be less severe [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/4-benefits-of-lfp-batteries/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/4-benefits-of-lfp-batteries/) , [https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/cars/tesla-lfp-battery/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/cars/tesla-lfp-battery/index.html)\n* The LFP battery is more ethically sourced. The materials are abundantly available and have fewer ethical labor concerns, especially relative to cobalt in NMC batteries.\n* The LFP battery theoretically has slower range degradation and a longer lifespan. Over time, the range gap between theoretical SR and LR models will narrow. [https://www.mhwmag.com/whitepapers/new-tests-prove-lfp-lithium-batteries-live-longer-than-nmc/](https://www.mhwmag.com/whitepapers/new-tests-prove-lfp-lithium-batteries-live-longer-than-nmc/)\n* I do not have to baby the LFP battery. I can plug it in, charge to 100% and forget about it.\n* The SR is \\~200lbs lighter than the LR, which I hope ekes out a little more on efficiency and is better for tire longevity and tire particle pollution (just a hunch, I have no proof for this).\n* I get 95% of the benefits of having a Tesla at a fraction of the cost - the charging network, technology, wide accessory support, direct-to-consumer model\n* If I were to sell, I am hoping the depreciation on a $30k car hurts less than the depreciation on a $40k car\n* I don\u0019t drive fast enough for the dual motors to be worth it for me.\n\nI felt that the LR benefitted peace-of-mind, but offered no practical differences in my driving scenarios.\n\nIn the end, I got a new Standard Range Model 3 for $27k after rebates and $33k after all taxes and fees. It would have been $2k lower if I qualified for the state rebate. Been driving it for 3 weeks and done 2 road trips with no regrets so far. For a new car, this Model 3 SR a great value!",

Granted, still getting used to the braking and all the odds and ends and bells and whistles. Traded in my very comfortable 2018 Honda Civic, which served me well for the past half-decade. Having lived overseas in countries where pollution is frankly way worse than America (we\u0019ve got it really good here) \u0014 where the sky was always whited out, where it was damn near impossible to breathe, where I was in sensory overload returning to America and actually seeing a blue sky \u0014 it feels phenomenal knowing I\u0019m no longer contributing to emissions. I really hope this works out and I never have to return to ICE vehicles! \n\nAlso, I realize Elon Musk has spread a lot of super-problematic and harmful rhetoric online and, of course, I\u0019m not a fan of that \u0014 but I also recognize that this car was built by some of the most intelligent and innovative scientific &amp; engineering minds of our time striving to make a positive impact on our environment and reduce the effects of climate change, CO2 emissions, and global warming. \n\nEven the microcosm of the Tesla dealership where I picked it up (Cherry Hill, NJ) was a beautifully diverse and friendly workforce. \n\nI cannot recommend Tesla enough. Without a shadow of a doubt, this was the EASIEST car buying experience of my life. Took about five minutes total to sign a few forms, set up the app, and they sent me on my way.

      "text": "**Background** I know this has been covered before as I've done considerable lurking and searching for the past month, but I haven't seen anyone with quite the same situation I'm in. Seems like most people are driving far more miles than me, or are relying on Supercharging way more. I'm interested in the M3P after driving my dads M3 LR. Obviously a M3P purchase isn't for cost savings reasons, I drive so little miles I barely pay anything in gas. I really like the acceleration in the M3, the gadgets, the self driving, the Tesla mission, and I'd like to stop polluting so I'm willing to \"inconvenience\" my life a little for these things.   \n\nI currently live in an apartment and I don't believe the landlord will be accommodating on installing a charger. I know for sure the hospital I work at wouldn't install a charger either. I live a couple miles from a Supercharger and a couple blocks from a slow destination charger at a strip mall (unfortunately couldn't walk home as it's a major highway so just a couple hours shopping/eating). Additionally I could charge at my dads house which is only a few miles away, I like to visit him once a week anyway.  \n\nFrom what I've read, if I turn off sentry mode and COP I'll only lose a couple miles a day. Of course I'd like those features but my current car doesn't have them so it's not that big of a deal. I park in a shaded garage 5 days out of the week so heat isn't a huge issue, they also have security patrols and video cameras. Apartment is gated and I park away from everyone else, in a nice part of town so it's pretty safe. I live in the south and I'm very warm natured, so I'll barely use the heat in the winter but I'll be cranking the AC all summer.  \n\nI'd be driving 9 miles a day (45 a week), losing ~14 miles/wk to phantom drain, and let's round up 6 miles/wk for errands (I'm close to everything in this city) that brings me to 65 miles a week. Keeping the battery between 10% and 80% I should have roughly 200 miles range so that's 3 weeks between needing charges. My thinking is if I charge a little at dads and a little at the strip mall every week or two there I could make it work, then I'd use the Supercharging for emergencies and out of town trips. I wanted to know if I'm missing something or if anyone is in a similar situation and making it work?  \n\nThanks for any replies or corrections :)",

      "text": "A bit of context first, in France there is an incentive if you destroy an old polluting vehicle and get a new low emission car. Processing time of this is around 3-4 months and Tesla offered to directly deduce this from the price if we destroy it just before delivery (so they have the papers proving it's been done in order to not take any risks). Which we did 2 days ago.  \n\n\nI had spoken to the dealership a few weeks ago about the refresh, they told me they didn't know anything about it, it's only rumors, and couldn't guarantee that the new version would be delivered in November, not even in 2020.  \nSo we went on with it not willing to wait until 2021 and losing 1000¬ of incentive (the amount will decrease 1000¬ each year from now on).\n\nBut here we are today, it's delivery day at 16:00, and this morning the website displays the new version, with all the bells and whistles promised by the rumors, with increased range thanks to the octovalve and heat-pump as you all know it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would you do if you were me? \n\nWould you refuse delivery ? (If it's even possible, all the papers are already in order, the car is already considered \"mine\" by the state).\n\nWould you take a rental car for just one month and wait for the refresh to be delivered?\n\nWould you take delivery anyway and trade in 2-3 months? How much would the M3 have lost in value because of the refresh?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main concern is not necessarily about having the latest version for the features (although they're nice to have of course), but more about the fact that **for the same price** you have more value, and of course the car has already lost value before we receive it thanks to this update.",
